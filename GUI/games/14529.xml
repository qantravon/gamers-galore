<root><id>14529</id><name>Virtuoso</name><description>Virtuoso plays like a first person shooter, very much in the same vein as Id Software's 'Doom'.    The basic plot is that you are playing a 'mega-rockstar' who is hiding in his hotel room from his fans and chooses to escape into a virtual reality.  There are three scenarios to play, 'Mars', 'The Haunted House' and 'Marine'.  Which feature different graphics, maps, sounds and enemies.  The protagonist looks like a typical rocker, with black leather jacket, dark shades and long hair.  The levels are completely flat, with no steps or slopes - as in the original Wolfenstein 3D.  You cannot select a weapon - instead you will always use the most powerful weapon collected so far.  Each weapon has unlimited ammunition.    Although Virtuoso plays like a First Person Shooter, the actual camera angle is more 'over the shoulder' but this is only aesthetic and doesn't affect the otherwise clear FPS game mechanics.   The basic objective of each level is to score as highly as possible before leaving the map. Virtuoso received generally poor critical reviews, reviewers cited the gameplay and lack of long term interest as their reasons.  The graphics, sound effects and in-game music were generally well received, scoring more highly than elements such as gameplay and long term interest.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7694">Wolfenstein 3D</game><game id="7326">Doom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/22/1069047-virtuoso.jpg</image></root>
