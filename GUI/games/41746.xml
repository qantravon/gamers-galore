Chatran is the Japanese name for the kitten character, named Milo in the international version.The release marks the first FDS game from Pony Canyon as well as the first Nintendo game of any sort to be developed by Marionette, which would go on to develop several more games for the console.GameplayKoneko Monogatari is a straightforward side-scrolling platformer. The player controls Chatran (Milo) and must avoid enemies while collecting apples from the nearby trees. By walking on top of the branches, Chatran can cause the apples to fall. This is also his only method of defeating the enemies roaming around, such as mice and rhino beetles, as he lacks any other sort of offensive ability.Chatran can, however, collect a power-up that confers to him a temporary Starman-esque invincibility state that will allow him to defeat any enemy he touches while the effect lasts. Also, Chatran can collect the four letters "H", "E", "L", "P" from rustling certain tree branches and spelling out the whole word will summon Poosky (Otis), Chatran's puppy friend, who will run ahead and take out enemies for Chatran. Unfortunately, he will also defeat Chatran if the two should touch.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33743">What's Michael?</game><game id="26118">A Week of Garfield</game><game id="24621">Super Mario Bros.</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2442435-koneko_monogatari_fds.jpg</image></root>
