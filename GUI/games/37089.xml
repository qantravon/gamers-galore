Home Run Nighter goes one step further than its contemporaries by having every batter in the fictional teams that comprise the Pennant League their own unique sprite. Some will be taller than others, or have exaggerated facial features. It's possible that some of the athletes (and the managers, which appear during the preparation stage) are modeled on actual Japanese baseballers.Home Run Nighter would receive a single sequel in Home Run Nighter '90.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/2091037-1.jpg</image></root>
