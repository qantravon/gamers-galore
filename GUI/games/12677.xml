Sláine: The Celtic Barbarian is a computer version of adventures of  the brutal barbarian and his sidekick Ukko created by Pat Mills. The game itself is an adventure/RPG hybrid. Every single action taken during the gameplay is executed by clicking the corresponding command floating on the screen. this system is applied to fighting, walking, communication, managing, equipment etc. - it may seem versatile, but in fact seems to be pretty chaotic as players may often be confronted with clicking wrong commands. The game world is presented by static screens.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/106662/1502794-slaine4.jpg</image></root>
