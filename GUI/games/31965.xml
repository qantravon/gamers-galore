<root><id>31965</id><name>Revenge of the Balloon-Headed Mexican</name><description>Â OverviewRevenge of the Balloon-Headed Mexican is the third game in the         Ben and Dan series of adventure games and the first in an     episodic series featuring the two characters. For the first time in the series        Ben and       Dan can split up when the player wants them too.      Zombie Cow Studios has also said that the game will be less parodic and referential as the last two games. They have also said that the events take place after    Time Gentlemen, Please! but isn't a direct sequel. Meaning that it will be easy for anyone to jump in. The games will also be   episodic in size and scope and will "be the same sort of length as a TV show depending on player skill". They also said that it will still feature text dialog as they cannot afford voice actors unless "some reckless fool goes and buys 100,000 copies of Time Gentlemen, Please!".</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6049">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</game><game id="4372">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6247/1419036-announce_title.png</image></root>
