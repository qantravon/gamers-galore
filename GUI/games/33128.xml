<root><id>33128</id><name>The Fancy Pants Adventures</name><description>OverviewThe game is based on a flash game series of the same name created by Brad Borne. It is a side-scrolling platformer where the player takes control of a stick figure known as Fancy Pants Man. The game plays like a standard platform game, where the levels consist of collecting objects called squiggles, defeating various enemies such as   spiders and snails, and jumping from various platforms to reach the end of the level. The game also includes boss fights, and collecting squiggles unlocks more accessories for Fancy Pants Man, such as different hairstyles and hats, new pants colors and different handheld weapons.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="20773">N+</game><game id="13373">N</game><game id="20602">LittleBigPlanet</game><game id="34928">Mirror's Edge 2D</game><game id="34424">Tribes Ascend</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1744555-box_fancypants.png</image></root>
