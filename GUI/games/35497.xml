<root><id>35497</id><name>Thrill Drive</name><description>Race through traffic while attempting to avoid other cars as well as occasionally being chased by the police as you race to the finish line. After choosing a track location of either U.S.A, Europe or Japan, you may choose your vehicle from a sedan, sports car, controvertible, station wagon, SUV bus or truck (and a secret car as well).Of course the winner is whoever gets to the finish line the fastest, but at the end of the game you are a shown the amount (in money) of how much damage you caused, as well as an assessment chart of your driving abilities, along with a letter grade. If you are among the drivers to have caused the highest financial toll in accidents, you can ad your name to the infamous leader board.If as you race along you get into a major accident the game will "scream", the windshield will crack and you will be shown a replay of your accident before being reset to the place where you accident took place to continue the race.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="20484">Burnout</game><game id="9112">Crazy Taxi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/121305/1799979-ss1.jpg</image></root>
