It was also one of two Great Sports games to never be released outside of Japan - the other being the first Great Golf game.The Great Baseball known in the west is actually this game's sequel, called The Pro Yakyuu: Pennant Race in Japan.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375575-great_baseball_sms_jp.jpg</image></root>
