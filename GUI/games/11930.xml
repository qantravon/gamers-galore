Subsequent Japan-only sequels would have use same title, which roughly translates as "Ultimate Tiger". The game was originally released in arcades, but subsequently received a PC Engine version (which never saw a Turbografx-16 equivalent) and eventually a version for the Genesis.The FM Towns Marty version is arcade perfect but was released 7 years after the arcade cabinet. It is much harder than the other home versions as it penalises much more harshly on continue points.GameplayThe helicopter comes equipped with a default forward-firing weapon that is able to hit both air and ground targets, as well as a finite supply of bombs which hit enemies in a wide radius for massive amounts of damage. The player can find power-ups by shooting down the relatively sturdy Chinook enemy choppers, which initially allow the player to upgrade their standard gun to include more shots, but will eventually allow them to pick up weapons that can fire in different patterns. These include a four-way shot that fires in the four cardinal directions and a spread shot that fires forwards and outwards in a cone. The player can also find additional bombs by destroying the same enemies.At the end of each stage, and occasionally partway through, is a boss. These take considerably more damage than regular enemies and can fire a lot more projectiles as well.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21880">Twin Hawk</game><game id="5623">Thunder Blade</game><game id="2551">D-Force</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5450/897584-twin_cobra_cover.jpg</image></root>
