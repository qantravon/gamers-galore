Mostly, it consists of her daydreaming and avoiding obstacles while also trying to look good and perfect her routine.   The game has two difficulty levels: Junior Model (Easy) and Super Model (Hard).StagesBarbie Super Model consists of very linear stages. It has four stages in total.   Driving StageThis stage features Barbie driving a pink car and having to avoid other cars, who are driving quite dangerously.  Rollerskating StageThis stage requires Barbie avoid other people and birds. Cycling StageThis stage features Barbie on a bicycle. She has to avoid birds and frisbees.  Hiking StageThis stage features Barbie hiking through snow. She must avoid people towing sleds, icy patches on the ground and snowballs.  MinigamesEach stage consists of the same three minigames. These are:  Body Magazine CoverHere, the player has to match Barbie's clothes to those shown on the magazine colour. Barbie has a vast wardrobe, and the player is also expected to manually change colours if needed.   Catwalk PractiseBefore you turn around and go back the other way on every stage, the player is told a sequence of buttons to press to make up Barbie's modelling routine. They can practise it as many times as they like, but they need to memorise the buttons.  Face Magazine CoverThis is similar to the first minigame, except the magazine cover shows Barbie's face instead. The player must match Barbie's accessories and make up to the magazine colour.   At the end of each level, the catwalk practise sequence is then used again, this time without prompts. The player must do the same sequence again from memory.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/126726/1778459-giant_bomb_sub_3.jpg</image></root>
