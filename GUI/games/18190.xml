Players then fight against AI or each other in arenas by using their glove powers, as well as throwing various items scattered about the stages. Many levels have unique features; the moon level for instance is low gravity. Score is tallied at the end by direct hits, luck bonus, and round score.  Note: Does not run on PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 consoles.CharactersApacheArnoldBubbaBullCuteyD.DDecoHarryJoeyKageKoolPoisonSanpeyShaneTen TenYamada</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20100">Power Stone</game><game id="15952">Crash Bash</game><game id="13790">Ooga Booga</game><game id="4153">Bomberman Live</game><game id="24430">Bomberman Ultra</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2433/180190-poypoy2palfrontyb6.jpg</image></root>
