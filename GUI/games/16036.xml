He stated that the audio was horrible, the character models looked bad, and the rosters and stats were actually off from the stats in the season it advertises. This is ironic because the stats are a big draw for the game's fans, as the stats in the game are extremely deep.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20835">MLB 08: The Show</game><game id="15449">Backyard Baseball 2001</game><game id="5123">MLB 99</game><game id="21254">Major League Baseball 2K5</game><game id="2250">Triple Play 98</game><game id="1202">Triple Play 97</game><game id="17271">Triple Play 2002</game><game id="7000">Triple Play 2001</game><game id="9670">Triple Play Baseball</game><game id="14025">Triple Play 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261100-box_hhmlb03.png</image></root>
