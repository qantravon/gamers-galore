<root><id>5596</id><name>Decap Attack</name><description>DecapAttack was the basis for a long-running comic series in Sonic the Comic (Fleetway). Written and drawn by comic editor Nigel Kitching, it ran for longer than any other Sega game adaptation (aside from Sonic the Hedgehog). It had a particularly dark sense of humour. Given the limited nature of the game, most of the character's personalities were original including the notion that Dr Frank N. Stein is from Wales and his German accent is entirely fake. Most of the characters' names are obvious puns.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5251">Mega Man</game><game id="6927">Dynamite Headdy</game><game id="25570">Magical Hat</game><game id="18090">Psycho Fox</game><game id="16371">Sapo Xul√© vs. Os Invasores do Brejo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370494-genesis_decapattack_eu.jpg</image></root>
