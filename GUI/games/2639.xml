One interesting fact about the game is that both planes controlled fairly similarly despite their actual handling differences in real-world combat.HighlightsThere were a few firsts for the Flight Sim genre set by this game. MiG Alley was one of the first games to incorporate a "dynamic" campaign; one where the events and missions were shaped by the players previous battles, not just predetermined encounters as many other predecessors were. The game also had very customizable artificial intelligence which, when turned up very high, was extremely realistic, especially for the time it was released.PlatformsThe game was originally developed for Windows 98, but when you make some slight changes, the game is compatible on Windows XP. The game can also run on Windows Vista and Windows 7 with no edits necessary. Empire Interactive has released the open source code, hoping the community would make a Macintosh compatible version.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9130">European Air War</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1766711-ma1.jpg</image></root>
