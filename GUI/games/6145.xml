It is the first original Legend of Zelda handheld title since the Oracle series in 2001. The Minish Cap is the last purely two-dimensional Zelda game with gameplay hearkening back to the original games. After Minish Cap, the handheld games moved to the third dimension with alternative play styles in both Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks for the Nintendo DS. It may well be the last Zelda game of the original formula. Nintendo have since confirmed that the game takes place second in the Zelda timeline (after Skyward Sword). The backstory it gives is similar to that of Ocarina of Time, and it introduces how Link got his iconic green cap.Gameplay Link, shrunk down to Picori size.The Minish Cap has many similarities with previous Legend of Zelda titles. It retains the same style of dungeon exploration, item collection, and boss beatdowns. It only allows players to have two items at once, and your sword does not have to be equipped at all times, which allows for more creative puzzle solving. Each boss is defeated by an item that Link gains in the boss' dungeon. As with previous titles, the Minish Cap features numerous sidequests that allow you to gain a variety of different power-ups such as weapon upgrades and another series regular, Piece of Heart. There are many recurring characters and races in the game as well, such as Gorons and Tingle - whom has many brothers this time around. Enemies from the previous games return as well, including Octoroks, Chu Chus, and Keese. Some of the classic items in the Zelda series are also featured in the Minish Cap, including the Boomerang, Bow, and the Pegasus Boots. The Minish Cap also introduces plenty of new weapons as well. Some new toys in Link's arsenal include the Gust Jar (which shoots a gust of wind), Roc's Cape (likely a descendant of Roc's Feather; it allows Link to float), and the Mole Mitts (which allow Link to dig). The most important new tool is Link's cap, the Minish Cap. The Minish cap, a living hat named Ezlo, not only acts as a guide to Link (similar to Navi) but also allows him to shrink down to explore new areas.For the first time in any handheld Zelda game, Link was able to roll. This was a useful skill in both mobility and combat. Link also gains abilities from previous games like Wind Waker (Great Spin Attack) and Adventure of Link (Down Thrust).KinstonesThis NPC wants to fuse Kinstones.The game introduced new features as well, one of them being the Kinstones system. As Link traverses about the world, he can find various Kinstone Pieces. These are used to piece together with NPCs. After fusing Kinstones with an NPC, an event will happen somewhere in the overworld and the player can travel there for an item or power-up of some sort. Kinstone Pieces are colored by rarity, the rarest offering the best reward. There are four colors of Kinstone: Blue, Brown, Green and Gold. The Gold ones are the rarest and are only used for Story progression. NPC's that want to fuse appear randomly, although they have the same piece requirement no matter how many times you playthrough the game. Keeping track of which characters you've fused with and have fused with is a challenge that leaves most games unfinished.FigurinesOne of many figurines.Another feature unique to the Minish Cap is the figurine sidequest. Throughout the world you can collect Mysterious Shells which are then used in a lottery type game to earn figurines. Figurines can be of enemies, characters, or locations that Link has encountered in his travels. However, figurines are only available after Link has met the character, killed the enemy, or gone to the location. The chance of winning a figurine that hasn't been won before is upped by the amount of Mysterious Shells that are spent in the machine, one shell upping the percentage by one.Items and WeaponsSword and Four SwordThe main weapon of choice for Link in this adventure. It is used to attack various enemies, bushes and pots that stand in Link's way. When in its final form, the Four Sword, it allows Link to use special blocks located around the world to solve various puzzles by creating up to three clones of himself that involve defeating various enemies and pushing heavy blocks/boulders that may block his path. Link can also learn various techniques through eight Tiger Scrolls that give him a wide variety of attacks throughout the game.Gust Jar Link with the Gust Jar.This item allows Link to clean up patches of dirt by sucking up air from a reasonable distance away. Doing so will allow Link to go over areas once that hindered his progress without any problems. If Link continuously holds the jar out, the jar will change color and allow him to fire a gust of wind out to attack enemies in the area. In the first dungeon of the game, it is mainly used to cross over water by bringing mushrooms towards him that flung him over water.Cane of PacciThis cane is used to flip over various blocks and enemies throughout the game. When used on certain enemies, they become vulnerable to Link's attacks. When used on objects, they allow Link to progress over them that will allow him to visit new areas. This item is picked up in the second dungeon of the game and it can be used from a small distance. If it is shot at a hole in the ground, Link will be able to jump on to higher ledges.Boomerang and Magical BoomerangThe Boomerang is your standard throw and comeback weapon in this game. It can stun enemies as well as get small item pickups such as Hearts, Rupees, arrows and bombs that are across gaps. It can only be fired in a single direction, unlike the Magical Boomerang, which can be controlled by holding the item button and moving the direction pad. While it doesn't give you complete control over its movement, you can bend it around certain obstacles.Small Shield and Mirror's ShieldThe Shield allows you to block physical, but not magical projectiles from enemies. It's gotten very early on in the game before you visit any dungeons and is very useful then because you are low on health. It can also be used to getting around some of the trickier, but smaller enemies, and can sometimes stun them if it is a certain type of enemy. The Mirror's Shield allows you to block energy attacks from enemies, and it can also not be taken away by Like-Likes unlike the Small Shield since it cannot be bought at stores and is instead a pickup you receive from a side quest. Mole Mitts Link digging with the Mole MittsThis item allows you to dig through dirt. While it's only used in a few places in the entire game, it is useful since it allows you to open up new paths. Flame LanternUsing this item allows you to light up a certain area around Link in darkened places. It can also be used to light torches in various areas to provide a greater viewing area in those places, as well as solve certain puzzles to open up access to new rooms or give you treasure in the form of new items, money, etc. Bombs and Remote BombsBy placing Bombs, Link can open up new paths in dungeons or parts of the overworld. They can also be used to damage enemies of varying shape and sizes. Stay clear though as they can damage you as well as your enemies. Once you plant them you can pick them up and throw them, but they are on a finite timer once they are in play. Remote Bombs solve this last problem by allowing you to set them off whenever you feel like.Pegasus BootsThe Pegasus Boots allow Link to run fast with his Sword held out in front of him. They are mainly used to have Link get through timed gates, but are also useful for quick travel around Hyrule.Roc's CapeUnlike Roc's Feather in previous Game Boy Zelda games, this allows Link to double jump and float by holding on the item button. This allows Link to climb vertically as well in the dungeon it is picked up in. It is also used to cross various gaps and avoid enemies quickly if you do not have a Shield equipped. Roc's Cape gives you freedom to explore all of Hyrule once it is obtained.Ocarina of WindThis Ocarina acts similarly to the one in A Link to the Past, by allowing Link to quick travel to one of a few preset locations throughout Hyrule by using it. A bird called Wind Crests will fly Link to a destination of your choice. But you must first, in a similar to fashion to the game mentioned above, free the bird from its statue. An interesting fact is that the tune it plays is same as the Warp Whistle from Super Mario Bros. 3.Bow, Arrows and Light ArrowsThis combination of items allows Link to fire projectiles at enemies directly in front of Link. They also allow him to hit switches that are otherwise unreachable, via Gust Jar or Roc's Cape. Near the end of the game you receive the Light Arrows, a superior form of Arrows that allow you to charge them up and fire an arrow at enemies with both physical and magical properties. These arrows are mainly used to defeat the final boss of the game.BottlesThese allow Link to carry certain items for healing throughout the game. Link can obtain four of these throughout the game, and will allow him to carry such items as Lon Lon Milk, a substance that heals Link's hearts, fairies that can also heal him, even after he falls and finally potions with various effects.Grip RingThis allows Link to scale various vertical walls and mountains.Power BraceletsThese bracelets allow Link to push around heavy objects when he shrinks down to Minish size.FlippersThese allow Link to swim in water, which allows Link to travel to more places throughout Hyrule and in various dungeons.Pieces of HeartBy getting four Pieces of Heart, Link gains a new Heart Container. You can earn Pieces of Heart by finishing various side quests and opening certain treasure chests throughout the game.Heart ContainersThese are earned by defeating dungeon bosses throughout the game. While completely optional, they increase Link's overall heart count by 1, while not affecting your current Piece of Heart total.Carlov MedalA completely useless Gold Medal in the form of Carlov's face. This item signifies you've acquired every single Figurine in the entire game.Kinstone BagThis item allows you to hold and look at your various Kinstone pieces. It will tell you how many of each Kinstone piece you have. It will also change its shape depending on how many Kinstones you have in it at once, even though it can never reach a set maximum amount of Kinstones.Tiger ScrollsThere are eight of these you earn throughout the game, each of which grants Link a special ability. While none of these are required for completion, they make progression through the rest of the game easier.Spin Attack - By holding your attack button with your Sword equipped, you can do a spin attack.Sword Beam - When your hearts are full, your Sword shoots out a beam of energy similar to early Zelda games.Dash Attack - When using the Pegasus Boots and Sword together, your sword will be extended while dashing.Peril Beam - When you are down to one Heart left, your Sword shoots out a beam of energy.Rock Breaker - This allows you to break Pots with your Sword.Roll Attack - After performing a roll, you can attack immediately afterwards.Down Thrust - In conjunction with Roc's Cape, you use your Sword on enemies from above.Great Spin Attack - The same as the Spin Attack, but if you mash on the Attack button, your attack will continue for a while.The Four ElementsThese useless jewels are awarded to you after you complete one of the four main dungeons of the game. They signify your progress throughout the game, and allow you to gain new powers with your Sword until you finally have the Four Sword.Earth Element - This is earned by completing the first dungeon in the game.Fire Element - This is earned by completing the second dungeon in the game.Water Element - This is earned by completed the fourth dungeon in the game.Wind Element - This is earned by completing the final dungeon in the game.EzloEzlo is Link's cap. He was once a Minish who was transformed into his green, bird-like, fabric prison by the Wizard, Vaati. Ezlo allows Link to become Minish in size at certain spots in the game, and can also have Link change back to normal size as well. Ezlo is also the game's Navi, giving Link hints and clues as to where to go next in his adventure. Most of them are story-driven events, so you are never constantly reminded of where to go until those events happen or you start up the game from a save. You can ask for his help by hitting select at any time.Story VaatiThe story in the Minish Cap focuses around the origin of Vaati and the Four Sword. The Picori (or Minish) are the creatures who gave a young boy his green clothes, sword, and shining golden light years previous to the Minish Cap.The story of the present begins when Princess Zelda is turned into stone by the evil wizard Vaati. Link is then chosen by the King of Hyrule to seek out the Picori and ask for their help to save Princess Zelda. When Link sets out, he rescues a talking hat by the name of Ezlo, whom he finds can turn him small like the Picori. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Ezlo used to be a renowned sage and craftsman with Vaati as his apprentice. Vaati was overcome by evil desire and stole a magic hat Ezlo made. The hat grants any wish that the wearer has, and Vaati wishes to become a powerful sorcerer. Ezlo, who tried to stop Vaati, was turned into a hat.After recovering the Four Sword, Link must fight Vaati in Hyrule Castle, after Vaati transforms it into Dark Hyrule Castle. After the battle, Ezlo is turned back into a Picori. The magic cap that Vaati stole is then given to Princess Zelda. All of the cursed people are cured and the hat disappears. Ezlo then gives Link a green cap similar in appearance to Ezlo's hat form, and then leaves to the Minish world.DungeonsThe Minish Cap has a total of six dungeons. Each of them have varying gimmicks, puzzles, enemies and bosses.Dungeon #1 - Deepwood ShineThe first dungeon of the game, as well as the first Minish-based one. This one mainly involves using the Gust Jar to get around, whether it be from going over bodies of water, moving a leaf around, or clearing cobwebs so you can proceed.Dungeon #2 - Cave of FlamesThis dungeon involves mine carts, flipping things over and changing directions to open up more paths to you. The Cane of Pacci, which is obtained here will allow you get past enemies previously unbeatable.Dungeon #3 - Fortress of WindsThis dungeon involves you obtaining the Mole Mitts and clearing out paths throughout the dungeon. There are some Minish parts leading up to the dungeon, but overall uses a couple of elements from the previous dungeon.Dungeon #4 - Temple of DropletsThe second and final dungeon where you are Minish in size. This dungeon has ice-based puzzles for the most part. You get the Flame Lantern here and it is a big part in solving the many mysteries of this dark dungeon.Dungeon #5 - Palace of WindsThis is where you earn the Wind Element and get Roc's Cape. This dungeon in the sky utilizes a lot of elements from previous temples, including the Gust Jar, the Cane of Pacci and Pegasus Boots.Dungeon #6 - Dark Hyrule CastleThis is the final dungeon of the game. Almost every item, weapon and puzzle element you have faced before comes into play in this dungeon until you face off against the final boss of the game.TriviaThe Ocarina of Wind tune is the same tune as the Warp Whistle from Super Mario Bros. 3.In Hyrule Town, there are three maidens you can do Kinstone Quests for. You can only complete two of them. This is an homage to the fact that 2 Oracle games came out on the Game Boy Color, where 3 were originally in development, but one of them was canceled.Lon Lon Milk makes its second appearance in the series, Ocarina of Time being the first.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10252">Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime</game><game id="22006">Dragon Ball: Origins</game><game id="24123">Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest: Shougeki no Shippo Dan</game><game id="7060">Lunar Knights</game><game id="7136">Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand</game><game id="14556">Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django</game><game id="11662">Shin Bokura no Taiyou Gyakushuu no Sabata</game><game id="17024">Juka and the Monophonic Menace</game><game id="2064">Back to Stone</game><game id="3955">Sigma Star Saga</game><game id="1320">Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal</game><game id="12945">Lagoon</game><game id="2248">Sword of Mana</game><game id="918">Monster Force</game><game id="2363">Hydlide</game><game id="7791">Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2119736-box_tloztmc.png</image></root>
