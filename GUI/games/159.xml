The game has the same core elements as the original, but new features, like driving and Arena battles. The game also changes from a level based system like the first game to a more structured, mission based game similar to    Jak II. The game features driving sectuions, and the main world is very large, and is acessed by driving around in a 4x4 Jeep. Indeed, driving elements make up a large part of the game, as some of the combat is fought in    mechs. Some missions consist entirely of objective- based goals, like putting out a set number of fires with a helicopter. This game was recieved better than the first. It was produced by    Krome  Studios and published by    EA Games. It was released on the 12 October 2004 in North America, and on the 5 Novemeber 2004 for PAL Regions. Story Ty battles against a Frill Lizard mech in his Bunyip power suit.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is set in the Australian Outback, in a    hub world called Burramudgee. Burramudgee is a significantly larger hub world than the original's Rainbow Cliffs, and features pedestrians who Ty can talk to, vehicles that are un-driveable, Bush rescue's base of operations, and a Driving garage where Sheila has parked the 4x4, and Ty can exit into the massive outside world. After Boss Cass breaks out of jail with the aid of Fluffy and her mech, he sets up his own community to grant himself 'Diplomatic Immunity', so Ty can't apprehend him without proof. Dennis sets up a rescue service called 'Bush rescue' to aid Ty in his attempt to bring Boss Cass to justice and help other civilians from Boss Cass's evil plans, which include making a race of Uber Lizards, taking control of Burramudgee, and absconding with the local population. Ty must race to save his family and friends once again.
