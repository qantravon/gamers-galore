Later that year, it was released as a pack-in for the Sega Saturn in North American territories. Virtua Fighter Remix was an updated version of Virtua Fighter that maintained the same gameplay, but featured redesigned graphics as an attempt to improve on what some considered to be a lackluster original release. Despite being sold at retail in Japan, the North American release was provided to all Saturn owners, free of charge, upon its release in 1995 via a mail-in offer. The game would later be released into Japanese arcades via Sega's Saturn-based ST-V hardware and a PC version hit the following year under the name Virtua Fighter PC.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1791106-box_vf1r.png</image></root>
