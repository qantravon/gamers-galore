In  The Devil's Tuning Fork, a mysterious epidemic spreads among the children of the world and pulls them into comas. One of these comatose children (you) awakens in an alternate reality devoid of any light. Nearby, however, floats the Devil's Tuning Fork, a magical instrument which allows the wielder to visually perceive the world through sound.
