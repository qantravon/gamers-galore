You are a fish(ie) who has to survive over 100 levels in various game modes, in situations that just get crazier and crazier! “Capture the Star”, “Soccer”, “Survival”, playing solo or in a team… And amazingly the whole game is played with just one button! No need to get to grips with complicated commands. Here, all you need to do is press the A Button on your Wii Remote.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13157/1333676-fishiefishiecover.jpg</image></root>
