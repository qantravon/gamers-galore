The game is available to those that pre-ordered Bioshock Infinite; it includes unlockables, which can be redeemed in Bioshock Infinite once it is released. The game will remain online up until August 26, 2013.Throughout the game, players are presented with the history of Colombia and its inhabitants prior to the events of BioShock Infinite. Each puzzle in the game represents a BioShock Infinite related item being produced within a factory (such as 'sky-hooks' and 'Murder of Crows'). Once each level is complete, the player must choose which faction to deliver that item to - either The Founders or the Vox Populi - these choices affect the game's story, and ultimately reward the player with images that can be used on Facebook and Twitter. Other rewards that can be unlocked in Bioshock Infinite are unlocked by finishing the first twelve puzzles.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25869">Cogs</game><game id="29167">Geared</game><game id="33796">Geared 2!</game><game id="7654">The Incredible Machine</game><game id="28006">Okamiden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81005/2417853-biir_0056_layer_2.png</image></root>
