The game's visuals appears to be similar to those of early pre-8-bit, Atari style video games, almost similar in look to the original Pong. The game is a four player fast paced game between two teams of two, the Green team versus the Purple team.Games are typically completed quickly, in two to three minutes. Teams try to score by obtaining the ball, then bringing and keeping it in their team's goal area.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22195">Pong</game><game id="12955">Soccer</game><game id="28798">Soccer</game><game id="25096">Warlords</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/30183/2234846-hokra.jpg</image></root>
