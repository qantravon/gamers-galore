Unfortunately, this game didn't take a page from Mario Kart. There are no powerups except for the occasional boost. The game has been criticisized due to the fact that the driving is a little bit too responsive. Very much more so than other racing games of the era.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26848">ModNation Racers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5578/840335-cv_bcr_usa_a.jpg</image></root>
