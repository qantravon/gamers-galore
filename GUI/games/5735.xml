Mickey and Mini have the unique ability to change outfits during the game to use different powers. Although when released for the SNES and Genesis the game was seemingly just anotherÂ  Disney game, the Game Boy Advance remake added the term Magical Quest 2 to it's name, indicating that the game was a sequel to the 1992 SNES game Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse. It is not clear if this game was always intended as a sequel to that game, or it was just retitled that in hindsight. </description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14279">Land of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse</game><game id="29084">Mickey Mouse Magic Wands!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363860-snes_greatcircusmysterystarringmickeymouse.jpg</image></root>
