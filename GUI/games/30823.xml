<root><id>30823</id><name>Town &amp; Country 2: Thrilla's Surfari</name><description>The game is made up of 7 worlds containing about 5 stages each (some worlds contain only 4 stages). The majority of the stages of each world consist of obstacle course levels, where you control Thrilla on a surfboard or skateboard, dodging obstacles and enemies while making your way to the end of the level. As you pass through levels you collect coconuts, which are then used in a "Shell Game" at the end of the level, where the player has an opportunity to win 1ups. At the end of the World, the player fights a Boss enemy, by dodging attacks and throwing exploding Coconuts or other items at the boss to defeat his health.</description><genres><genre id="23">Skateboarding</genre><genre id="47">Surfing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20645/1333514-town__country_ii_thrillas_surfari_frontcover_large_6mbuekpfmbwyj4s.jpg</image></root>
