Super Pitfall is an action-adventure platformer developed and published by            Pony for the         Famicom and       PC-8801 (both in Japan) on September 8, 1986 (and later released worldwide in 1987 by            Activision for the Nintendo Entertainment System). Super Pitfall is a loose remake of Activision's 1983           Atari 2600 game,          Pitfall II: Lost Caverns. Â Players control     Pitfall Harry as he ventures through the lost caverns (a large, seamless cavern with smaller "warp zones") while collecting gold bars (and other items), avoiding traps, and shooting enemies with his   pistol. Harry's main tasks, however, are to find the priceless Raj diamond, his adventurous niece, Rhonda (who has been turned to stone), and his imprisoned pet mountain lion,  Quickclaw.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11123">Greendog: The Beached Surfer Dude!</game><game id="3087">Spelunker</game><game id="10014">Pitfall!</game><game id="35937">Rocky Memphis and the Temple of Ophuxoff</game><game id="105">Monty on the Run</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/238340-super_pitfall.jpg</image></root>
