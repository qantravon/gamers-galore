The second expansion pack for Sid Meier's Civilization IV, Beyond the Sword adds several new gameplay mechanics, including corporations (a late-game equivalent to the "religion" mechanic), enhanced espionage, random events (including random "quests"), colonization (in which maintenance of overseas cities can grow to a point where the cities break off into their own vassal state), expanded victory conditions (mainly the Space Race and Diplomatic conditions), enhanced AI, and optional advanced pre-game setup phases (in which players purchase cities, units, buildings, and other improvements with a certain amount of gold prior to the game beginning).The expansion also includes ten new civilizations (each with their own leader), six new leaders (for existing civilizations), new units (including new regional art styles for some units), new buildings (including new Wonders), and new technologies. It also added twelve new scenarios (custom mods made by either the Firaxis team or by fans), ranging from historically accurate ("Rhye's and Fall of Civilization" and "WWII: The Road to War") to medieval fantasy ("Fall From Heaven: Age of Ice") to space exploration ("Final Frontier").This expansion also includes all additions from the first expansion pack, Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Warlords, with the exception of its eight unique scenarios.Tech Tree ModificationsThe first major change in Beyond the Sword is the technology tree. Keeping with the "Beyond the Sword" concept these changes are concentrated mainly in the later stages of the game with a few mid-game changes as well.New Technologies:Advanced FlightEra: ModernRequires:FlightSatellitesEffects:Obsoletes StableCan train GunshipCan train Jet FighterAestheticsEra: ClassicalRequires:WritingEffects:Can construct the ParthenonCan construct the Statue of ZeusCan construct the Shwedagon PayaLaserEra: ModernRequires:PlasticsSatellitesEffects:Can train Mobile ArtilleryCan train Mobile SamCan construct SDIMilitary ScienceEra: RenaissanceRequires:ChemistryEffects:Can train GrenadierCan train Ship of the LineCan construct Military AcademyStealthEra: ModernRequires:Advanced FlightCompositesEffects:Can train Stealth BomberCan train Stealth DestroyerSuperconductorsEra: ModernRequires:ComputersRefrigerationEffects:Can construct laboratoryCan construct Research InstituteCan construct SS ThrustersTech Tree Changes:ComputerRequires PlasticsFiber OpticsRequires Computers or LaserRoboticsNo longer directly requires PlasticsEspionageWhile espionage and spies existed in Civ IV before Beyond the Sword, this expansion takes that system and expands upon it. The first change is that in addition to money, culture and research you now have espionage points that are tracked for your civilization. Much like culture and research, you can select what persentage of your civilization's income is spent on generating espionage points each turn. As well, you'll generate espionage points from various buildings and civics automatically.The ultimate goal of this system is to use your espionage points against other civilizations through active or passive effects. Passive benefits include being able to see your opponent's cities and what technology they're researching. Active effects usually require a Spy unit infiltrating another civilization's cities and conducting some action that reduces the number of points you'll have available. These actions can range from "Poisoning the Well" to stealing technology. The cost of both passive and active benefits depends on how many points you have vs your opponents.CorporationsCorporations are sort of a late game religion. Once you've researched the Corporation technology various Great Persons can found one of seven corporations. But in order to build a corporation you need to have it's additional prerequisite technology. For instance, to build "Mining Inc." you'll need to have research Railroads. Once you have those requirements you'll need one more thing, a city with the appropriate resource(s) to consume. After you've found the right location, move your Great Person there and create the Corporation's HQ just like you would construct any other Great Person building.After a corporation has been founded, it can be spread by the Corporate Executives unit to other cities. Once the these units arrive at a city, with the appropriate resources, the controlling player will need to pay money to add the corporation to that city and yield the benefits.Aluminum, Inc.Requires:RocketryGreat ScientistConsumes:CoalBenefits:3 research per resource consumedMakes aluminum availableCereal MealsRequires:RefrigerationGreat MerchantConsumes:CornRiceWheatBenefits:0.75 food per resource consumedCivilized JewelersRequires:Mass MediaGreat ArtistConsumes:GemsGoldSilverBenefits:1 gold per resource consumed4 culture per resource consumedCreative ConstructionsRequires:CombustionGreat EngineerConsumes:AluminumCopperIronMarbleStoneBenefits:0.50 production per resource consumed3 culture per resource consumedMining Inc.Requires:RailroadsGreat EngineerConsumes:CoalCopperIronGoldSilverBenefits:1 production per resource consumedSid's Sushi Co.Requires:MedicineGreat MerchantConsumes:CrabClamFishRiceBenefits:2 culture per resource consumed0.5 food per resource consumedStandard Ethanol Co.Requires:PlasticsGreat ScientistConsumes:CornRiceSugarBenefits:2 research per resource consumedMakes Oil availableColoniesBeyond the Sword also adds the ability to allow your cities in far away lands to break off and become independent nations. After this occurs the city essentially becomes it's own civilization as your Vassal, with it's own leader. This frees you have having to pay the maintenance costs of a city so far away from your main empire while allowing you to maintain some sort of control over it.Victory ConditionsTwo of the game's victory conditions have been modified. The Diplomatic Victory has been expanded to include a religious victory through the Apostolic Palace relatively early in the game. Much the same as the Diplomatic Victory via the UN, a civilization requires 75% of all votes to complete this condition.The other change is that the Space Race portion of the game has been expanded into it's own mini-game. After launching a Space Ship for Alpha Centauri, the game turns into a mini-civilization game where players must then control that ship during it's flight. To help make the end game more interesting, players are no longer required to build all of the Space Ship's parts. While this may allow you to launch sooner, it may also result in your ship taking longer to reach Alpha Centauri.Random EventsThe final game changer included in Beyond the Sword is random events. Much as the name suggests these can be events such as a volcano erupting or a tornado hitting your city, but can also appear as missions for you to complete.New CivilizationsBabylonLeaders:Hammurabi -
