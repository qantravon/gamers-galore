Originally released for iOS, Total War Battles: SHOGUN is now available on PC and Mac through Steam and on select Android devices.GameplayIn a series first, construction and combat takes place on the same hex-based mapUnlike entries in the main Total War series, base building and combat in Total War Battles: SHOGUN takes place on the same map and features simplified gameplay with smaller unit sizes. The player constructs their base on the left-hand side of the screen, and deployed units can only ever move right. Both buildings and units are aligned to a hex-based grid.Available units fall into one of three archetypes — infantry, cavalry and ranged — which gives the game a Rock, Paper, Scissors-type combat dynamic.
