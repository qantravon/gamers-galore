The player assumes the role of Storm Jaxon as he attempts to retake his homeland Westica after it is conquered by the eponymous Captain Skuljagger and his Kiltish army. The game is a 2D action platformer in the vein of Prince of Persia or Flashback, though without the emphasis on precise controls. The player must fight their way through each stage before a time limit expires, using power-ups like bubblegum to fly small distances and power gems that increase the player character's swordfighting prowess. There's also a two-player mode that allows each player to alternate turns.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364759-snes_skulljagger.jpg</image></root>
