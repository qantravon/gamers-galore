Unusually, as a result of the location of the development team, the game saw a release date in Europe on 6th April 2001, almost a year before it was released in North America (22nd July 2002). The game featured advanced graphics, but was not critically successful; its short length and similarity to other games such as Syphon Filter was attributed to this.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15466">Red Faction</game><game id="13683">Quake 4</game><game id="21358">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2022682-box_c12fr.png</image></root>
