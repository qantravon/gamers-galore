Captain Rainbow is the star of his own television show, in the land of the free, Mameruka. Thanks to the appearance of some unpopular characters, however, the ratings for his show have recently tanked. In order to gain back the show's popularity and keep his job, Nick decides to head off to Mimin Island. Something happens along the way, however, and Nick learns that he is the only person who can help out the residents of Mimin.And those residents happen to be forgotten characters from the Nintendo family, including Ossan, the character from the original Golf and Hikari, from the Japanese game Shin Onigashima. This unique game promised multiple gameplay features for a unique gaming experience. Unfortunately, it isn't known if it delivered on those promises as Captain Rainbow was only released in Japan and import reviews are unusually rare.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2259">Segagaga</game><game id="503">Giftpia</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2533448-captainrainbowclean.jpg</image></root>
