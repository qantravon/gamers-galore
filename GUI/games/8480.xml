The developers at Visual Concepts had previously worked on their NFL 2K football games until 2005 when Electronic Arts acquired the exclusive rights to publish NFL content. After a couple year hiatus the 2K football team returned with a new idea. Knowing that they couldn't use any of the current NFL content or player likenesses Visual Concepts and 2K Sports decided to go in a new direction by signing the NFLPA's respective Hall-of-Fame to be in the game.The game starts off by having the player create their own team. While creating their team the player gets to customize many attributes including uniforms, team logo, stadium design, and the team's name. After creating the team, the player is then sent to a legend selection screen. The legends are split up into three tiers, gold, silver, and bronze. You are however limited to only two gold, three silver, and six bronze legends per team. All of the non-legend players on your team are automatically filled in by fictional characters.GameplayAPF 2K8 featured gameplay that was very similar to that of its predecessor, ESPN NFL 2K5. The physics engine received a notable upgrade, featuring more fluid motion between animations, and improvements in model collision where now players would slide their arms past or move their foot over another player rather than clipping through them. With the exception of the Xbox 360's bumper integration, controls stayed exactly the same from 2K5.A noticeable change in the mechanics were in regards to turnovers. The frequency of user-induced interceptions and fumbles dropped substantially from that of 2K5, while the frequency of blocked field goals increased.PresentationThe visual presentation of APF 2K8 was greatly improved over NFL 2K5, featuring higher polygon-count models, enhanced facial animations and much more elaborate stadiums.In-game announcers stayed the same from NFL 2K5 (Dan Stevens  Peter O'Keefe), and many recorded lines from 2K5 were reused in APF 2K8. Without the ESPN license, Chris Berman was removed from commenting on half-time and post-game highlight reels, and instead the commentary was replaced by the in-game announcers.APF 2K8 suffers from graphical glitches, such as players seemingly bending their legs at the knee to a 90Â° degree angle and then proceeding to float a few feet above the ground over players who are lying down in their path. The game also re-renders all plays during highlights and during many post-game highlight reels the coaches can be seen standing in the middle of the highlighted plays as if they were shaking hands after the game.With Electronic Arts holding the publishing rights to NFL-related content, there has been much support of development for unofficial roster updates using NFL characters in APF 2K8. These updates consist of many attributes of actual NFL content, including player names, likenesses, attributes, jerseys and team names. The updates are created by creating a game save on the Xbox 360 in-game, then transferring that save to a computer, using a complex hex-editor to manipulate the game content, and then the save is transferred back to the Xbox 360 hard drive.Legends2K Sports has licensed over 240 retired NFL legends for All-Pro Football 2K8.
