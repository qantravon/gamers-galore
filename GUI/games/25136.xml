<root><id>25136</id><name>Road Trip</name><description>Road Trip is an adventure/racing game with a free form structure and open world gameplay. Players start out with a basic car and can compete in races, do miscellaneous chores, or simply drive around the amazingly large world. Contrary to the cover, the game has a very cutesy art style. Players can upgrade their car with all kinds of different parts. Some, like the rocket booster, help the player reach new areas. Players can collect ChoroQ coins scattered about the environment and exchange them for upgrades. Not much is known about this game and it sold poorly in the US. Most who have played it would consider it a cult classic.
