Based on          The Ultimate Doom, though far less violent, you must guide the         Chex Warrior in his quest to save Chex City from the dastardly Flemoids.  Chex Quest 2 is available as a download on      Charles Jacobi'  s personal website, which includes all 3 Chex Quest games.    External Links       Chucktropolis - Charles Jacobi's personal website, with Chex Quest download link</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12655">Cap'n Crunch's Crunchling Adventure</game><game id="30677">Sonny's Race for the Chocolatey Taste</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2891/648953-chexquest2_titlecard.png</image></root>
