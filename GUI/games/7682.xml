Unlike in the Sims, the player here has direct control over one character. The gameplay is similar to that of Animal Crossing , as players can do tasks for the town's residents and get items in return. Unlike in Animal Crossing games however, there is a much bigger focus on user created content. Most of the tasks in the game requires the player to build something for someone.The player does this within his workshop using a predetermined blueprint. The blueprint allows players to easily make the desired piece of furniture by selecting the block and snapping it into place. The blocks needed to complete each piece are highlighted in green, and the blueprint even tells them where the block goes on said piece. Despite the predetermined blueprints, improvisation is both encouraged. and in later tasks, required as many Sims require that furniture carry a certain "Essence"Essences are the main collectables in Mysims and they come in multiple flavors. From a basic standpoint essences fall into 5 different Categories: Cute, Party, Genius, Goth and Food. Within each of the categories there are many different types of essences and it is these subcategories which Sims require be attached to their furniture.Essences can be found in several different ways such as fishing, prospecting and chopping down trees among others. Part of the challenge in the game is finding out to find new essences which thetown residence request.PC VersionBuild and customize the bed to the player's likingMySims was officially announced for the PC at E3 2008.
