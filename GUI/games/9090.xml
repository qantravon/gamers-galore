The game includes all 65 teams in the NCAA tournament andÂ 50 all-time great teams from the 1951 Kentucky Wildcats to the 2007 Florida Gators. You choose offenses (inside, outside, balanced, fast break, etc.) and defenses (man, zone, man press, zone press, etc.). Players get tired if they play too many minutes. You can call time outs and substitute players in and out. You can double team opposing players or give the ball to a go-to-guy at the end of the game. You can play against another person or against the computer player. You can play a whole game in less than a minute by pressing and holding the enter key. The main game screen includes a scoreboard, detailed stats for the players currently in the game and a play-by-play box. The action is all described in writing in the play by play box. There are no graphics to speak of, but the game yields accurate statistical results.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9866">NBA Street Vol. 2</game><game id="1533">Double Dribble</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17608/575463-smalllogo.jpg</image></root>
