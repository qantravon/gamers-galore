Instead, you create your own avatar, who is supplied with a free deck of cards. To get more cards, you'll have to buy booster packs in normal stores like Target or Wal-Mart. These cards can also be used to play the card game against live players. Once you feel like you are ready to duel, there are several dromes (arenas with specific rulesets) you can enter to battle.  Drome 1 - Beta: works with all types of decks Drome 2 - Hotekk: works with advanced 3v3 apprentice decks which do not use Mugic Drome 3 - Imthor: played with international cards only, does not use Mugic and is only 3v3</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1132126-137850e.jpg</image></root>
