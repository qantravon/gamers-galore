The car can increase in size to get over large gaps, decrease in size to squeeze through tight spaces, flip, rotate, and morph in all sorts of contortions. Jelly Car was later ported to the iPhone app platform where it won Best Kids Game in the 2008 Best App Ever awards.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29511">Jelly Car 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/216/839739-jelly_car.jpg</image></root>
