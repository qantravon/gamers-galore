A top-down shooter against zombies, 8-bit creatures, and funky-coloured shapes.Time Viking: A side-scrolling shooter where the Time Viking battles robots using mind bullets to build up a tower to the moon. Also features an iconic song.ENDL3SS ZOMB1ES!!1: Identical graphics and gameplay to I MAED A GAM3 but arranged as a series of rooms, much like ROBOTRON.Because most Windows Phones lack physical controls, the game is played using onscreen touch "sticks". As an official "Xbox Live" game on Windows Phone 7, Z0MB1ES (on teh ph0ne) includes achievements and leaderboards. Using the MEGA GAMES CREATOR 2000 option, players can use images on their phone as monster sprites that appear randomly during gameplay.Though the song still states the game costs a dollar, this version retails for $2.99 on the Windows Phone Marketplace.</description><genres><genre id="31">Dual-Joystick Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27873">I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MBIES!!!1</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/86881/2132209-zombies.png</image></root>
