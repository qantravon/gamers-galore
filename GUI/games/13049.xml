<root><id>13049</id><name>Breakout</name><description>OriginThe idea for Breakout originated circa 1975 when Atari founder Nolan Bushnell decided that they should release a version of the hit game Pong that could be played by a single player, as the first Pong featured no programmed AI.Atari assembled a team that included Pong designer Al Alcorn and future Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The arcade cabinet was released in May 1976, the game was in black and white but featured colored plastic over the bricks.The game would go on to be ported to several platforms, including the Atari 2600 and Apple II.GameplayIn Breakout you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and the point is to hit a ball to the top of screen to break the bricks that are set in six different colored lines at the top. When you hit a brick in the top three colors the speed of the ball greatly increases, and when you hit the top of the screen past the bricks your paddle gets smaller. Both of these features combine to make the game much harder.Requires paddle controls to play.LegacyWhile the game was a moderate success upon release, it was largely forgotten by the early 1980s. In 1986, however, Taito revived the Breakout style of gameplay with Arkanoid, which became a considerable success, launching its own Arkanoid franchise and inspiring numerous clones based on the same Breakout formula. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4381">Alleyway</game><game id="9094">Kaboom!</game><game id="21712">Ricochet Infinity</game><game id="3635">Ricochet Lost Worlds</game><game id="22740">Circus</game><game id="22195">Pong</game><game id="22783">Cosmic Smash</game><game id="11710">Off the Wall</game><game id="16354">No Escape!</game><game id="1043">Oink!</game><game id="9686">Squeeze Box</game><game id="23653">Space Out</game><game id="21608">Arkanoid DS</game><game id="1089">Amiganoid</game><game id="23747">Peggle Nights</game><game id="9078">Bolo</game><game id="24026">AirBurst Extreme</game><game id="19382">Blockbuster</game><game id="390">Bunny Bricks</game><game id="24756">The Block Kuzushi Hyper</game><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game><game id="1936">Circus Atari</game><game id="25054">Bit.Trip Beat</game><game id="2378">Bachelor Party</game><game id="19344">Kirby's Block Ball</game><game id="20551">Nervous Brickdown</game><game id="24062">Arkanoid Live!</game><game id="26185">bricks4ever</game><game id="20888">Block Buster</game><game id="27262">GloBall</game><game id="26465">Shatter</game><game id="27472">Vortex</game><game id="1457">Breakout in Space</game><game id="27550">Act Out</game><game id="27551">Quester</game><game id="12190">Abandon 2</game><game id="27688">Illusion</game><game id="17151">Jinks</game><game id="26619">Arkanoid Plus!</game><game id="843">Krypton Egg</game><game id="24908">Ricochet Xtreme</game><game id="29660">Trajectile</game><game id="4774">Bricks of Egypt</game><game id="27971">Gem Smashers</game><game id="30765">AlphaBounce</game><game id="12116">Barkanoid 3 Gold</game><game id="16818">Barkanoid 2</game><game id="9327">Thunder &amp; Lightning</game><game id="27684">Aquanoid 2</game><game id="31263">Aquanoid GOLD</game><game id="31510">Aquanoid 3 - 3D</game><game id="15045">Woody Pop</game><game id="23111">AirBurst</game><game id="33323">Bit.Trip Flux</game><game id="35673">Bit.Trip Complete</game><game id="372">Aquanoid</game><game id="17389">Hotshot</game><game id="36493">Hello Kitty to Issho: Block Crash V</game><game id="35666">Wizorb</game><game id="36864">Dragon Dance</game><game id="37033">Amazing Breaker</game><game id="39229">Crystball</game><game id="39274">Stone Smash</game><game id="2">Breakfree</game><game id="34666">Jongbou</game><game id="39600">Simple 1500 Series Hello Kitty Vol. 03: Hello Kitty Block Kuzushi</game><game id="21953">Ricochet Lost Worlds: Recharged</game><game id="39946">Super Bunny Breakout</game><game id="40092">BreakQuest Extra Evolution</game><game id="40114">Goindol</game><game id="40119">Vs Block Breaker</game><game id="40242">Breakout</game><game id="21976">Jirbo Break</game><game id="26674">Videocart-17: Pinball Challenge</game><game id="30668">Brickyard/Clowns</game><game id="41267">Simple 1500 Series Vol. 14: The Block Kuzushi</game><game id="41268">Block Kuzushi</game><game id="41269">3D Block Kuzushi</game><game id="32188">Absolute BrickBuster</game><game id="10304">Construction Bob</game><game id="43449">Hello Kitty to Issho!
