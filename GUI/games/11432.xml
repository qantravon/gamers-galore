Suzanna!" to signal level completion (when your little joey says MOM in big letters after you rescue him or her).  When ringing the bell to bring in the next selection of fruit, you hear the Westminster Quarters song (often heard in college campuses). As you get closer to the top of each level a gorilla will come out and want to box you.  It's best to avoid him and keep going till you reach the top.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="311">Donkey Kong</game><game id="19416">Donkey Kong Jr.</game><game id="14419">Popeye</game><game id="19687">Jumpman</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367716-a2600_kangaroo_none.jpg</image></root>
