The game is actually licensed to Takara, the Japanese publisher of the board game (who would also create a few Game of Life video games of their own).The goal is to make it to retirement with the most assets. The player can also get married, have kids and experience various other important life changes, but the primary goal is the acquisition of funds. The player is also able to invest funds and gamble, the outcome of which is dependent on pure luck.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2340">The Game of Life</game><game id="39818">Tetsudou-Oh</game><game id="6640">Bakushou!!
