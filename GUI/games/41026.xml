The in-game credits attribute the creation of the game to Kenny Lee and Teddy Lee of Decade Studios, now Cellar Door Games.GameplayThe player may collect ten in-game medals (equivalent to achievements) to mark milestones in the pursuit to achieve final medal "You Are the Shit King."It should be noted that in an attempt to appeal towards a players sense of decency, the developers allow for other words to be typed, though this will not replace the term "shit" in-game. In a trans-game comment, the author stated, "If you don't like typing swear words, poo, plop, dump, and so on all work as well."</description><genres><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/100318/2411555-dontshityourpants.gif</image></root>
