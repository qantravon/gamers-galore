<root><id>21132</id><name>Prey the Stars</name><description>Prey the Stars is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS developed and published by Koei. The game is known as "Gabu Gabu Planet" in Japan and is set to be released on 7 October 2008. The concept in PtS is to choose a dog-like sprite (each with different strengths and weaknesses) and then to face off against 3 other beasts on a 3d map with the challenge being to eat as many household objects as possible within the time limit. The challenge comes from the fact that you can only eat smaller objects until your character grows in size. As well as featuring a single-player story mode where your enemies are AI controlled, the game also supports every multiplayer option supported by the DS.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20646">de Blob</game><game id="11867">Katamari Damacy</game><game id="18373">We Love Katamari</game><game id="6924">Me &amp; My Katamari</game><game id="11678">Beautiful Katamari</game><game id="18032">The Wonderful End of the World</game><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="23314">Baby Pac-Man</game><game id="23313">Pac &amp; Pal</game><game id="21086">Tornado</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3569/541222-937353_86749_front.jpg</image></root>
