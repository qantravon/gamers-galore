There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22849">Tecmo Super Baseball</game><game id="7266">Ken Griffey Jr Presents Major League Baseball</game><game id="3894">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run</game><game id="11803">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</game><game id="14051">Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr</game><game id="20835">MLB 08: The Show</game><game id="20687">MLB Power Pros 2008</game><game id="5682">MLB 06: The Show</game><game id="2315">MLBPA Baseball</game><game id="6304">MLB SlugFest 20-04</game><game id="17874">MLB 2004</game><game id="22724">MLB 07: The Show</game><game id="5123">MLB 99</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3201/184076-eb_8.jpg</image></root>
