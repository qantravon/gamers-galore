Mazan's virtual katana blade matched the player's movements precisely.The arcade machine was released in Japan, the United States, and United Kingdom. However, the game's electromagnetic tracker technology was too expensive and required significant floor space, so it was not as widely available in the US or UK outside of the larger arcades.Arcade hardwareThe arcade machine used expensive electromagnetic tracker technology for the accurate motion-sensing technology. Namco produced their own custom GPU cards in order to provide enough power to run the unit. Each custom GPU card was capable of 1.4 GigaFLOPS, and up to 16 could be inserted into the unit, where they would automatically function as a multi-core system. With 3 GB of EPROM on each card, they could be assigned dedicated tasks, such as monitoring the electromagnetic trackers in real-time.CPU: Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC CPU (200 MHz, 360 MIPS, 1.4 GFLOPS)Sound Engine: ARM7 Yamaha AICA 45 MHZGraphic Engine: PowerVR (PVR2DC)Multi-Core GPU System: Up to 16 custom Namco GPU cards, with 1.4 GFLOPS and 3GB EPROM each (up to 22.4 GFLOPS and 48GB EPROM in total)External linksMazan: Flash of the Blade, Virtual Worldlets NetworkMazan: Flash of the Blade (Arcade) Review, Pure Waffle </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30322">Dragon Ball Z V.R.V.S</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5911/765487-mazan.jpg</image></root>
