The player is in control of a boy's shadow which must scale the shadows of a tall tower. This is laid out in a level-to-level structure wherein the player must solve puzzles and fight enemies along the way.  The boy is also accompanied by a mythological air spirit known as a Sylph. This companion offers varying elements of gameplay through the alteration of foreground light sources which in turn alters the arrangement of the shadows in the 2D world.  Occasionally, the player is able to step the boy out of his 2D world of  shadows, and into a 3D version of the shadow world where the boy may  interact with the objects themselves as opposed to simply their  shadows.    OverviewA boy has his own shadow detached from his body and thrown away from the top of an enormous tower by a mysterious man and from here on out the game follows the boy's   shadow, which can only walk on other shadows. The player must help the shadow climb back to the top of the tall tower, which is filled with puzzles and enemies. Different NamesThe European release is named "A Shadow's Tale"The Japanese release is named "  影の塔 " (kage no tou), which translates to "Tower of Shadows"</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9638">ICO</game><game id="25508">A Boy and His Blob</game><game id="28074">The Magic Obelisk</game><game id="25209">LostWinds: Winter of the Melodias</game><game id="30380">Limbo</game><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="31753">Echochrome II</game><game id="37669">Contrast</game><game id="37262">Deadlight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1886614-box_lis.png</image></root>
