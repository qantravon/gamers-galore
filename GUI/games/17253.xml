<root><id>17253</id><name>Irritating Stick</name><description>Irritating Stick (originally Dengeki Iraira Bou), is a carnival game in which the player has to move a spinning stick through maze-like levels, without touching the borders. If the borders are touched, the player gets "zapped" and loses the game.The original japanese version had an announcer who would yell things to confuse the player and trick him into touching the walls of the maze. This "feature" was removed from the American version, presumably because it was more cost-effective to remove the announcer than it was to record new English language dialogue.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7040">Kuru Kuru Kururin</game><game id="33849">Uchhannanchan no Honou no Challenge: Denryuu IraIra Bou</game><game id="39224">The Irritating Maze</game><game id="13534">Kururin Paradise</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2120435-box_istick.png</image></root>
