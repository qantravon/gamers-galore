The bulk of the gameplay involves platform jumping and shooting pellets out of Magic Boy's wand. When an enemy is hit with the pellets they are stunned and Magic Boy can collect them in his bag. If an enemy is left in the bag too long without the player dumping the enemy then Magic Boy dies a horrible, horrible death.  Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 6,5,5,6 and 5 out of ten.  Mike Weigand wrote, "Here is another game that has great ideas (like being able to grab stunned enemies and carry them around with you), but they get almost completely lost in the poor control.  The colors are beautiful and very well done".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363940-snes_magicboy.jpg</image></root>
