It was innovative in that you controlled only one player rather than a whole team. Gameplay therefore involved making runs and calling for passes, something unusual in football sims.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31217">Pro Evolution Soccer 2011</game><game id="28165">J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 2</game><game id="1929">The Premiership</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1769527-574481_833_front.jpg</image></root>
