<root><id>19728</id><name>(T)Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1</name><description>The concept for both the film and the game "(T)Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1" originated as a science-fiction comedy skit on the German television show "Bullyparade". Largely a parody of Star Trek(with spoofs of other famous science-fiction movies such as Star Warsand Back to the Futurethrown in), the story concerns the adventures of the three member crew of the Traumschiff Surprise, who are all flamboyantly homosexual and equally as flamboyantly German. The game allows the player to play as all three characters - Captain Kork, Mr. Spuck and Schrotty - during the course of the story. The film's original actors lent their voices to the game dialogue. GameplayThe game takes the format of the standard " point and click" adventure game where the player must solve puzzles to advance the story. Some additional minigames, such as a rhythm-based game, are also available. The game is controlled entirely with a mouse. TriviaThe word "Raumschiff" is the German word for "spaceship". When the "T" is added, the meaning becomes translated literally as "Dream Ship", the name of a German TV series.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13790/1562990-traum.jpg</image></root>
