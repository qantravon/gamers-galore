The player will still draw a hand, and those cards can be used at any time. After a set amount of time the player will draw more cards to fill out the hand.Players also start with 4000 life points. If the player takes enough damage to deplete the life points the vehicle will spin out, losing time.DS ConnectivityYu-Gi-Oh 5D's Wheelie Breakers can be synched up to the DS title Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator.
