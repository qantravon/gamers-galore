<root><id>5147</id><name>Wolfsbane</name><description>Title screenThe game is mainly an adventure game, even though the odd sidescrolling perspective. Items can be placed in your hand to use with your character.Wolfsbane focuses on walking around the town only known as "The Village", where you have to scour every edge of it to find out who's the werewolf that attacked you and made you into what you are. You have until the next moon to do so, and how much time is left is always displayed as a sun dial at the uppermost of the screen. Locales and inhabitants are of the medieval vari√©te, featuring anything from guardsmen, civilians and priests to local bar visitors, jesters and thieves.The local townsfolk is more interested in emptying their cups, than talking to you.The jester is everywhere, usually with some obscure information to boot.Enemies usually include robbers, skeletons and of course the werewolf himself.Voice acting is only seen in the introduction, along with an animated sequence. Except from that (and probably the ending), the main game has no voices. Background music varies depending on where you are at a given time.Dialogue options feature branching trees, meaning some characters will have more things to tell you if ask the right questions.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/86736/1336910-wolfsbane.jpg</image></root>
