<root><id>12544</id><name>Wacky Wheels</name><description>Wacky Wheels is most easily described as a Mario Kart clone, down to the psuedo Mode 7 graphics, although it's not quite as derivative as it appears at first glance.Fireballing to victory.You get an assortment of animals to race as, with varying abilities in terms of top speed and acceleration and weight. The eight-player races take place in a variety of colourful environments and there are weapon power-ups for speed boosts and oil slicks and rockets for taking out opponents in front of you.Mutliplayer mode introduces a bizarre wrinkle - you can tap certain taunt keys at various intervals, which spawns a chubby red demon to make faces or rub his buttocks on the screen right in front of your opponent's cart, obscuring the view of the track in front of them.Combat tracks round out the package as well as timed score affairs where you try and hit as many ducks scattered around the arenas as you can before the time runs out.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19071">Super Mario Kart</game><game id="11718">Skunny Kart</game><game id="12364">Battle Cars</game><game id="18026">Rock 'n Roll Racing</game><game id="16769">Mario Kart: Super Circuit</game><game id="20906">Cocoto Kart Racer</game><game id="15990">Diddy Kong Racing</game><game id="26848">ModNation Racers</game><game id="14317">Racing Aces</game><game id="4969">Big Red Racing</game><game id="710">Konami Krazy Racers</game><game id="20645">Mario Kart Wii</game><game id="18757">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</game><game id="10084">Mario Kart 64</game><game id="6539">Mario Kart DS</game><game id="26657">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</game><game id="1659">Jupiter's Masterdrive</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2944/268812-ww_000.png</image></root>
