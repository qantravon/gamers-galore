Taking place in Japan in the 1920s Japan, players take the control of an unnamed protagonist as he gains the title of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th. The Raidou name is bestowed to the person who shall become the next in a line of devil summoners and can not only converse with demons, but travel into the dark side of areas to prevent demonic influences. In order to take up this task, Raidou is employed at Narumi detective agency. From there all kinds of claims and mysteries wait to be solved.The main story revolves around a family curse and an evil army sent to do the bidding of their dark master. When the Narumi detective agency gets a strange phone call from a young girl asking them to meet her on the bridge on the city outskirts, it was clear something strange was up. When she asks them to kill her, it was obvious. Before anything can happen however, a strange soldier in red grabs her, thus putting into motion the events that will take place throughout the game.As mentioned above this is an action RPG. Though it wouldn't be a MegaTen game without the demons. Sadly however, the conversation system is gone and all demons will be caught in battle by weakening them and mashing the circle button. Raidou does still have the fusion ability at his disposal allowing him to create some powerful demons to aid him in his task. The demons also play a larger investigative role as well. A Pixie for instance can read peoples minds and get the facts that they are keeping from Raidou. This creates a great feel for the game in which investigation and some small puzzle elements are required to advance the story as opposed to the franchises typical dungeon crawling.While it isn't your typical MegaTen game, Devil Summoner has its own charm and is a great game for anyone looking for a lighter, more humorous take on the MegaTen world while still having the great stories and characters you've come to love.CharactersRaidou Kuzunoha the XIVThe protagonist and player-character of the game.
