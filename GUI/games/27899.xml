<root><id>27899</id><name>Brunswick Pro Bowling</name><description>Brunswick Pro Bowling was one of a handful of titles to be demonstrated at the 2010 Game Developer Conference using Sony's Playstation Move motion controller. The player's bowling motion is initiated by 'getting set' by pulling the top trigger on the controller and then initiating the bowling motion by pulling and holding the bottom trigger on the controller. Much like in Bowling in Wii Sports, the trigger is let go when the player brings their hand forward and wants to release the ball down the lane.  Brunswick promises to bring unprecedented depth to their bowling effort on the PS3 including the ability to read oil patterns on the lane and adjust for how that may affect your throw.  Kinect  MoveBrunswick bowling will be a launch game for  Kinect. It will also launch on Sony's Move.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="29">Bowling</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1114158-brunswick_pro_bowling_wii_front_of_.jpg</image></root>
