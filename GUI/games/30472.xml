But the major difference with Turba is that the tiles don't clear themselves automatically when you select three or more of them. Instead, you decide when to pull the trigger. This allows you to set-up massive chains as you can wait until more tiles come into play before you clear them out. You can also create chains for each of the four colors and clear them all away at once, resulting in incredibly high-scoring combos.There are a total of 3 games modes each with its own variation as to how blocks spawn onto the screen. Freeplay mode is more of a traditional match-3 with a full board of blocks, great for learning the game mechanics. Ascend mode will create a block with each beat of the song and when the screen fills its game over. Finally, Descend mode slowly drops whole rows of blocks down the screen. Online leader boards are supported for every song, allowing for competition.PC System RequirementsOS: Microsoft® Windows® XP/Vista/7Processor: 2.5 GHz Intel® Pentium® 4Memory: 512 MBGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 (can run on integrated machines, but performance might suffer)DirectX®: DirectX® 9.0c requiredHard Drive: 35 MBSound: DirectX® 9.0c-compliant sound card</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29407">Beat Hazard</game><game id="9436">Audiosurf</game><game id="27103">The Polynomial: Space of the Music</game><game id="32141">Rhythm Zone</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4344/1431971-header.jpg</image></root>
