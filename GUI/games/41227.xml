<root><id>41227</id><name>World Series of Poker: Full House Pro</name><description>OverviewWorld Series of Poker: Full House Pro (also known as WSOP: Full House Pro) is a free-to-play poker video game (using the Texas hold'em variant) developed by Pipeworks and published by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 (on September 4, 2013 via Xbox Live Arcade) and PC (soon for Windows 8 devices via Windows Store).A sequel (of sorts) to Microsoft's 2011 title Full House Poker, the game switches to a free-to-play business model, where players automatically receive a free stack of chips each day they log-in (but must pay for any further amount of chips or exclusive bonus items). Using chips earned or gold purchased (which is usually bought with real money), players can buy XP boost items (for themselves or other players in the table), avatar costumes, table customization (including felt, chairs, and decks), chip tricks, and chip stacking layouts.The game includes the same standard (now called "ring game") and tournament functionality as its predecessor (including the single-player Pro Takedown mode), with some minor changes (such as showing the winning player first in the "showdown" and allowing the other players to show their losing hand simultaneously). Texas Heat mode and Avatar Famestar support are not included in the game.The game uses an official license from the World Series of Poker series of poker tournaments, featuring real-world casino locales (Caesar's Palace and Harrah's New Orleans) and commentary from ESPN announcers Lon McEachern and Norman Chad.An open beta was released for Canadian Xbox 360 players on July 29, 2013.</description><genres><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33732">Full House Poker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543579-box_wsopfhp.png</image></root>
