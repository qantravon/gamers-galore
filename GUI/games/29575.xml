It superficially resembles a medieval Japan variant of The Legend of Zelda with its top-down view and branching paths, but has far more of an emphasis on combat than exploration and puzzle solving. The goal of the game is to explore strange goings-on at five separate castles and defeat the bosses at the end of each one.Nazo no Murasame-jou was actually the second original game created for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System device; the first being The Legend of Zelda.LegacyNazo no Murasame-jou protagonist Takamaru as he appears in Samurai Warriors 3.While Nazo no Murasame-jou did not receive any direct follow-ups, the game was eventually ported to the Game Boy Advance and is available in Japan as a Virtual Console title. However, the game did receive a sequel of sorts as the inspiration for a special mode included in Samurai Warriors 3. Murasame Castle mode evokes the gameplay concepts of the FDS title as presented through the gameplay of Samurai Warriors. Plotwise, it is a sequel, and sees Takamaru and a partner from the Samurai Warriors roster fight their way toward and through five castles, each with a boss from Nazo no Murasame-jou at the end.In Nintendo Land, the game serves as the theme behind the minigame Takamaru's Ninja Castle. Bearing no resemblance to the FDS title beyond its setting, it is a shooting gallery-style game in which the player must use throwing stars to fend off ninjas.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364889-fds_nazonomurasamejou_jp.jpg</image></root>
