<root><id>15525</id><name>Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia</name><description>Monster Madness is a 4 player co-operative action game, centered around ridding the evil monsters from your town. The game is a top-down experience, with the ability to pick up coins and parts to build new weapons, and upgrade existing ones. On the Xbox 360 Monster Madness also features 16 player multiplayer modes over Xbox Live.  All of the standard game modes you would come to expect in a shooter are present (Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, etc.)  Unfortunately, the lobbies are currently empty, making it nearly impossible to partake in the Live experience.The PC version has the least content out of the Xbox 360 edition and the PS3 version named "Monster Madess - Grave Danger". This version has no downloadable content, no online play nor leader boards. The recommended processor is a P4 @ 2Ghz or AMD equivalent while the game is supposedly not even multithreaded, AI and physics steer the framerate right off a cliff.Each character have there own personality and favourite weapon which adds some dynamics to the game;Zack – NerdCarrie – GothAndy – “Oddball”Jennifer - Cheerleader</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16116">Zombies Ate My Neighbors</game><game id="16760">Ghoul Patrol</game><game id="22186">Zombie Wranglers</game><game id="24253">Burn Zombie Burn!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1814893-box_mmbfs.png</image></root>
