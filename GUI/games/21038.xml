The player can make both cosmetic changes and limited stat adjustments to each member of the team. Kickoff also features special moves that can be assigned to specific players - for example, a quarterback can gain the ability to make rocket passes that have a much higher success rate, or a running back can be given a power run ability to increase his speed.The game was not made with the NFL license, so the teams and players are all fictional.</description><genres><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4166">Blitz: The League</game><game id="13768">Speedball</game><game id="2356">NFL GameDay 2001</game><game id="9640">NFL GameDay 2000</game><game id="34245">Madden NFL Football</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2251205-box_tbko.png</image></root>
