The game follows Meat Boy, a cube of meat with great skill in jumping, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend Bandage Girl from the menacing Dr. Fetus while avoiding sawblades, piles of salt, lava, missiles, and other deadly obstacles. The Xbox release, as part of Microsoft's Game Feast 2010 promotion, was sold for 800 Microsoft Points ($10) until November 21, 2010, when the price was cruelly raised to 1200 Microsoft Points ($15). The PC version was first released via Steam on November 30, 2010 for the same price. The PC level editor, PC level portal, PC non-Steam version, and Mac version of Super Meat Boy came out in 2011. The game was originally going to be released on Nintendo's WiiWare service, but was later cancelled due to their small file size restrictions.Like Alien Hominid, the concept for Super Meat Boy began as a free online game made in Adobe Flash for Newgrounds. The game, originally called Meat Boy, was released on October 5, 2008, and a map pack featuring custom levels was soon followed two months later. Super Meat Boy features homages to other games and movies in Newgrounds, as well as other video games and Internet culture such as unlockable characters from other indie games (Including N, Aquaria, VVVVVV, I Wanna Be The Guy, Braid, and Flywrench).The XBLA version of Super Meat Boy includes 12 achievements (worth 200 gamerscore) and two avatar awards: a t-shirt resembling Meat Boy (unlocked after a certain number of deaths) and a prop of Meat Boy running around the avatar (unlocked after completing the game). The Steam version of Super Meat Boy includes 41 achievements, adding new ones such as clearing all the levels in each world (Light World or Dark World) consecutively without dying, clearing bonus levels, and unlocking new characters.The game is not without its issues; glitches pop up on both the Steam and XBLA versions. The PC version suffers from the occasional crash, but the XBLA version has a "save glitch", which causes Super Meat Boy to lose the ability to auto-save after every completed level. Since manually saving is not an option, players are forced to quit to the dashboard and restart the game. Collected bandages will also fail to display on the map screen, and as such can be collected over and over again with each level replay. This allows for faulty completion rates of over 100% as the bandage counter exceeds its maximum of 20 per world. Team Meat has claimed that a patch is finished but has yet to come out due to Microsoft's terrible approval process.DevelopmentIn Indie Game: The Movie, Team Meat's progress was covered in great lengths. McMillen and Refenes were very interested in creating a game that reflected a part of themselves and were striving to make a game that could be a success without compromising their visions. Super Meat Boy was in development for eighteen months. A month prior to it's release, the team was offered a feature on the Xbox Live Dashboard despite the project being far from done. Facing financial struggle and left with almost no options, McMillen and Refenes spent the last month crunching to meet the deadline. In spite of their feature being absent for the first eight hours of release day, Super Meat Boy was able to sell 20,000 copies by the end of the day. It was announced that in April 2011 more than 600.000 copies were sold through Xbox Live and Steam. Steam was responsible for 400.000 copies. In January 2012, Super Meat Boy had sold over 1,000,000 copies across all platforms. At the Indie Game: The Movie premiere, Team Meat announced that they have moved on from Super Meat Boy and are currently working another project.GameplayThe objective of Super Meat Boy is to guide Meat Boy (or one of the other playable characters) past deadly obstacles to reach Bandage Girl, who will be promptly kidnapped by Dr. Fetus. Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a replay showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a jump button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as Tim's ability to rewind time or Viridian's ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a wall jump. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as the Kid's ability to double jump and Jill's ability to stall her descent.Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The "bosses" in the games are equally indestructible, and instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a cutscene is triggered.Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in purple WARP ZONEs, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.LevelsSuper Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the "Light World". If the player is able to clear a "Light World" level under its par time, they will be able to access the "Dark World" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. Along the way, players can also find purple Warp Zones within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character . There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special " glitch zone", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring "glitch state". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.Chapter 1: The ForestIntro Cutscene Tribute: Street Fighter II: The World WarriorBoss: Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.Chapter 2: The HospitalIntro Cutscene Tribute: CastlevaniaBoss: C.H.A.D. (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.Chapter 3: The Salt FactoryIntro Cutscene Tribute: The Adventures of LoloBoss: BrownieThe Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.Chapter 4: HellIntro Cutscene Tribute: Ninja GaidenBoss: Little Horn (monster created by dead Meat Boy corpses)Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.Chapter 5: RaptureIntro Cutscene Tribute: Mega Man 2Boss: Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.Chapter 6: The EndIntro Cutscene Tribute: Pok√©mon Red/BlueBoss: Dr. FetusUnlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts. After completing all five levels, the player can face Dr. Fetus in a boss level. The boss level is divided in to two parts, featuring a halfway checkpoint and a Dark World variant unlocked after completing 85 Dark World levels.Chapter 7: Cotton AlleyIntro Cutscene Tribute: Ghosts 'N GoblinsUnlocked after completing Chapter 6, Cotton Alley is a special 40-level world that can only be played by Bandage Girl (who is, ironically, rescuing Meat Boy from Dr. Fetus). Despite the pink and cheery atmosphere, the levels are extremely difficult. There are no bandages in this world; the obstacles are mainly limited to giant buzzsaws.TEH INTERNETS (Xbox 360) / Super Meat World (PC/Mac)Intro Cutscene Tribute: Bubble BobbleUnlocked after collecting 20 Bandages, TEH INTERNETS is a special chapter that provides downloadable chapters. All past and future chapters will be free in the Xbox 360 version, due to Team Meat's method of uploading the content in space reserved for free title updates. (Which bypasses Microsoft's normal method of distribution in their marketplace, which would cost either Team Meat or the end user money) All chapters will also be free for the PC and Mac versions.As of 1st April 2011, Super Meat World is released on the PC version, along with eight chapters of levels. It is also unlocked after collecting 20 Bandages. The level editor is still unavailable, and should be included in the next update.Each downloadable chapter contains 20 retro- themed levels (with par times to beat) and its own leaderboards separate from the main game. Chapters consist of either a mix of developer favorites (from user-generated maps on the PC level editor or from the original flash game), levels designed exclusively for certain characters, and other levels.Released TEH INTERNETS ChaptersThe Butcher Boy (by Team Meat, released 10/20/2010) - 8-bit Meat Boy only.
