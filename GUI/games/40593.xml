The player walks down an octagonal hallway and shoots any hostile extra-terrestrial life that bursts forth from one of the side-passages or the ceiling.Space Shadow was the pack-in game for the Bandai Hyper Shot, a sub-machine gun shaped Light Gun for the Famicom. Despite the fact that Light Gun games tended to do far better in the US, neither the Hyper Shot nor this game were ever released outside of Japan.</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23002">AlienÂ³: The Gun</game><game id="4174">Alien Brigade</game><game id="2543">Super Scope 6</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2372333-space_shadow_fc.jpg</image></root>
