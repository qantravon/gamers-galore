The unique feature of PopStar Guitar is that is does not require a large Guitar peripheral. Instead this games comes with an "AIRG" a snap on peripheral for the Nintendo Wii Remote that allows the player to press the buttons of the Wii remote like a guitar. Tracklist  Original tracks:When I'm Gone - 3 Doors DownIt's Not My Time - 3 Doors Down  Dirty Little Secret - All-American RejectsMove Along - All-American RejectsThnks for the Mmrs - Fall out Boy  Sugar we are going down - Fall out BoyMakes Me Wonder - Maroon 5Wake up Call - Maroon 5Shut Up and Drive - RihannaAll The Small Things - Blink 182Welcome to My Life - Simple Plan  Misery Business - Paramore  SOS - Jonas Brothers  See you Again - Miley Cyrus  Cover tracks:  Our Time Now - Plain White T's  Girlfriend - Avril Lavigne  Hot - Avril Lavigne  Before He Cheats - Carrie Underwood  Dance Floor Anthem (I don't Want to Be in Love) - Good Charlotte  Since You've Been Gone - Kelly Clarkson  Face Down - Red Jumpsuit Apparatus  Hero/Heroine - Boys Like Girls  Anna Molly - Incubus  Suddenly I see - KT Tunstall  The Saints Are Coming - Green Day  U2  How's It Going to Be - Third Eye Blind  1985 - Bowling for Soup  I Write Sins Not Tragedies - Panic at the Disco Honestly - Cartel It's Not Over - Daughtry </description><genres /><similar_games><game id="20639">Guitar Hero: On Tour</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11423/784611-popstar_guitar.jpg</image></root>
