The game is played using the keyboard, which in many of the events means bashing two keys like a madman as fast as you can to gain speed. You can play for the cup, where you can face each event in succession, acquiring points trying for the bronze, silver or gold medals, or you could play any particular event separately in training mode.There is also a multiplayer "hot seat" aspect, but in some events, usually races, you can face-off 1 on 1, at the same time, with both contenders bashing keys on the same keyboard like no tomorrow (definitely helping with the aforementioned shattering of keyboards).</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="42">Track &amp; Field</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18232">Track &amp; Field</game><game id="17889">Bruce Jenner's World Class Decathlon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/18269/1365698-shot2.png</image></root>
