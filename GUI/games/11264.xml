The first 16-bit baseball game available, Tommy Lasorda contained all 28 (at the time) major league ball clubs. All teams were actually trademark and copyright safe facsimiles of real clubs, as this was before professional league licensing was considered de riguer for a sports game. With full 25-man rosters and password enabled season progress, players had to manage their club effectively to win the world series.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15142">Sports Talk Baseball</game><game id="16174">Baseball!</game><game id="396">Reggie Jackson Baseball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19255/825054-254px_tommy_lasorda_baseball.jpg</image></root>
