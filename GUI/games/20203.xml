<root><id>20203</id><name>World Grand Prix</name><description>World Grand Prix is an arcade racer developed by Sega for the Master System. It is very closely modelled on Hang-On, as the player must cross the finish line in the allotted time. Hitting obstacles or other cars at speed (causing your car to explode before respawning) or spinning (caused by erratic driving  gear changes) can slow you down, making finishing hard. The car handles easier than the bike in Hang-On, as there is no balance to worry about, just steering.The game also features a full track editor, although the only backdrop available in this case is Japan.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10087">Pole Position</game><game id="3735">Pole Position II</game><game id="14919">Grand Prix Challenge</game><game id="37549">Taito Grand Prix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/129083/1774046-wgp.jpg</image></root>
