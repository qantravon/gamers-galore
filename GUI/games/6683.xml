Instead of being an SRPG/visual novel-hybrid like the other games in the series, though, Episode 0 is an action-adventure game. While riding atop her equine companion Larry, Gemini fights evil robots using Japanese sword techniques. The game features experience points and equipment systems that allow the player to upgrade Gemini and Larry's capabilities as they see fit.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/1681366-sw0.png</image></root>
