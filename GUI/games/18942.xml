Unlike, say, Gradius, in which the player collects a currency of sorts and spends them on their desired power-up, Alpha Mission requires that players target pyramid structures on the ground (similarly to Xevious) and collect the letters that appear. Each letter provides a different type of power-up, and also includes the "energy" (represented with the letter E) required to use them. There's also a few negative "power-downs" included as well, including a backwards E that will actually deplete the player's remaining energy reserves.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21861">Twinbee</game><game id="16079">Stinger</game><game id="22550">DonPachi</game><game id="3973">Super Star Soldier</game><game id="9449">Argus</game><game id="25828">Ray Crisis</game><game id="30721">ASO: Armored Scrum Object</game><game id="28120">SÃ¶ldner-X 2: Final Prototype</game><game id="1487">Xevious</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361130-nes_alphamission.jpg</image></root>
