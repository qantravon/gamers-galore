The player has to find items that are needed to complete puzzles, but the ultimate goal of each area is to find the six items that are connected to one another. Doing so will restore the anachronistic elements to their proper times, and move the player on to the next area.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1436">Team Xtreme: Operation Weather Disaster</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
