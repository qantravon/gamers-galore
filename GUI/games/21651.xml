A team of digimon was sent in to discover the truth behind what has happened and never returns. You play as a member of a Digimon Security Guard and follow in their steps trying to figure out what is behind these drastic changes.  The gameplay in Digimon World 4 is similar to that of any other top-down action RPG, like Diablo. Each Digimon can equip many different weapons that give them various combos they can utilize in battle, as well as spells that are given out based on which Digimon you are using.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18673">Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition</game><game id="32291">Digimon Battle</game><game id="13974">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue/Red Rescue Team</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2375796-box_dw4.png</image></root>
