The Japanese sequel to Super Mario Bros. (not to be confused with the American sequel of the same name), Super Mario Bros. 2 adds eight difficult new worlds (including one hidden world, reachable by clearing the game without the use of Warp Zones) and some new gameplay mechanics (such as the Poison Mushroom power-down, which harms the player when touched, and the option to pick Luigi, who sacrifices running speed for jumping height).While the original FDS version was not released worldwide in its original form, it was released worldwide for the Wii (via the Wii Virtual Console) on May 1, 2007 and Nintendo 3DS (via 3DS Virtual Console) on December 27, 2012. An enhanced remake was released on July 2, 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the Super Mario All-Stars compilation. It was also ported to the Game Boy Color on April 10, 1999 as an unlockable reward in Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Advance in Japan on July 10, 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini collection.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="21084">Kirby: Super Star Ultra</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2381303-cover_large.jpg</image></root>
