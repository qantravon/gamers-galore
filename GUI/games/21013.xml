After winning the approval of Sega-AM2 head        Yu Suzuki and        Sonic Team head        Yuji Naka, Sega-AM2 commissioned a        Sonic fighting game that became Sonic the Fighters. Â The game was included in       Sonic Gems Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and will be released as a downloadable title on the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network. The XBLM and PSN versions appear to feature      Metal Sonic,     Dr. Robotnik, and the previously dummied-out    Honey the Cat as playable characters.PlotThe Death Egg IIAfter the destruction of the Death Egg at the finale of        Sonic 3  Knuckles,        Dr. Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik rebuilds        Metal Sonic and constructs the Death Egg II.        Tails informs Sonic of the situation and plans to build a rocket so they can fly there and stop Dr. Robotnik again. Tails completes the rocket ship and names it the Lunar Fox. However, there are two draw backs; the space craft can only carry one passenger at a time; in order for it to function it requires the power of all seven        Chaos Emeralds. Sonic and Tails then set out to locate the seven emeralds when they discover that        Knuckles is in possession of one of them. After explaining to Knuckles what is happening, Sonic demands that Knuckles gives him his emerald. Knuckles begins to question why Sonic was chosen to pilot the Lunar Fox. It is then decided that Sonic and friends will hold a fighting tournament and the winner will be the one to fly to the Death Egg II to stop Dr. Robotnik and Metal Sonic.The ending is the same for every character. The player's character is piloting the Lunar Fox to Earth as the Death Egg II is destroyed by a huge explosion. Robotnik and Metal Sonic are then seen flying back towards Earth after the credits.CharactersPlayable:Super Sonic       Sonic the Hedgehog - Sonic attacks using standard kicks and punches along with his spin dash ability.
