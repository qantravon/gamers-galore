<root><id>1213</id><name>Baten Kaitos Origins</name><description>Baten Kaitos Origins continues the theme of its predecessor -- that is to say, giving the user expressly indirect control over the proceedings. Users aren't controlling Sagi so much as they are guiding him. Sagi will consult the user for advice, and many characters (those who are consciously aware of spirit guides) will refer to users directly.  A corollary of this mechanism is that the only level of customization comes in the form of interface and the name of the spirit guide him/herself. None of the other characters can be renamed.  Origins also adopts Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean's basic card-based combat structure, but refines it greatly, allowing characters to have a shared deck of cards. In addition, the new combat system is faster-paced, and slightly more unforgiving. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9209">Yu-Gi-Oh!
