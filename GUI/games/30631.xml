<root><id>30631</id><name>Marie Celeste</name><description>This is one of many text adventure games released for the ZX Spectrum in the 1980s.  This particular title was released at budget level (£1.99).  It is thin on story and characters and relies heavily on logical thinking to solve the puzzles.  The basic premise of the game has you entering the airlock         of a pirate spaceship, finding treasures, locating the whereabouts of the missing pirates and retrieving fuel for your ship.  This is unfortunately one of those games that can put you in a situation that you are unable to escape from, if you are not careful.  The only option being to quit and restart or reload a previously saved game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7909">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</game><game id="2048">The Price of Magik</game><game id="20750">Questprobe Featuring Spider-Man</game><game id="21865">Questprobe Featuring Human Torch and the Thing</game><game id="6677">Red Moon</game><game id="11797">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</game><game id="23413">Se-Kaa of Assiah</game><game id="9936">The Hobbit</game><game id="7209">Adventure B: Inca Curse</game><game id="30994">Dracula</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/378/1360421-marieceleste.jpg</image></root>
