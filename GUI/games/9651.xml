Like the original Underground, the sequel focuses more on the underground street racing rather than the series' traditional circuit racing. The biggest addition to Underground 2 is the ability to freely roam around in the game's open-world city. Also, there are newer racing modes like Street X and URL and a much deeper and greater customization option than the original. Underground 2 includes the voice acting talent of various celebrity models like Brooke Burke and Kelly Brook.

Reviews for the game were positive but there was several things that were criticized. Among those were having to drive for to long to get to races, bad voiceacting and strong product placement for companies with no connection to auto racing for example Cingular, which was integrated into the game's messaging system. Another thing that was criticized was the GameCube versions framerate issues and inferior graphics.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="1591">Need for Speed Underground: Rivals</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="7510">Need for Speed: V-Rally</game><game id="6829">Need for Speed: V-Rally 2</game><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="6582">Test Drive Unlimited</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="788">The Fast and the Furious</game><game id="10403">Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3</game><game id="9927">SRS: Street Racing Syndicate</game><game id="14975">Import Tuner Challenge</game><game id="11055">NASCAR 08</game><game id="20038">NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="284">NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="8438">NASCAR 06: Total Team Control</game><game id="21653">Asphalt: Urban GT</game><game id="23461">FUEL</game><game id="2000">Midtown Madness</game><game id="21689">Wangan Midnight</game><game id="5819">Speed Devils</game><game id="25254">Roadsters</game><game id="26043">Midnight Race Club: Supercharged!</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1897549-box_nfsug2.png</image></root>
