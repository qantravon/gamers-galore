<root><id>37127</id><name>Super Real Baseball '88</name><description>OverviewSuper Real Baseball was developed by Pax Softnica and published by Vap Inc., it was released in Japan only. It depicted a more "realistic" take on baseball when compared to its contemporaries at the time such as Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and Moero! Pro Yakyuu (or R.B.I. Baseball and Bases Loaded, as they were known in the US), which generally involved more cartoonish characters. Unlike many baseball games, Super Real Baseball actually had the licenses needed to use official names and teams from the Nippon Professional Baseball league.Also different was how the game chose to view the wider field: While most games at this time would switch to a bird's eye view once the ball had been struck and sent flying into the outfield, Super Real Baseball kept the perspective on the same "behind the batter" eye-height level.Pax Softnica had a good reputation for sports games enthusiasts at this time due to having been behind many of Nintendo's own core sports series such as Ice Hockey. Vap's reputation was considerably less glowing as they were responsible for the risible Super Monkey Daibouken.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/2094820-1.jpg</image></root>
