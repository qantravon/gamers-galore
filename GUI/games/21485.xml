His ranged attacks are throwing knives. In chaos mode, the warrior gets a hulking double sword and has very fast and strong attacks.Blacksmith - This giant hammer wielding class can pack a huge punch, but doesn't quite have the agility to back it up. His ranged attacks are throwing axes. In chaos mode, the blacksmith is stronger than ever, his attacks able to take down enemies easily.Mage - The mage is a rather difficult class to wield. You have an ice attack which is quite strong but leaves you open. Her ranged attacks are fireballs that will usually hit the target if you're able to lock on.
