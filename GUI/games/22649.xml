Martin Alessi, who gave one of the higher scores, wrote, "By far this is one of the best racing games that I've played on the Genesis in a long time. The gameplay is incredible and the number of options available keeps things interesting. I love the Turbo mode because the action really starts to fly when you get into fifth gear. This driver is actually Activator [a driving wheel] friendly, and if you don't mind looking silly, it can be a lot of fun. Smooth graphics are the highlight for this cart".</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19522">Live for Speed</game><game id="11009">Virtua Racing</game><game id="14919">Grand Prix Challenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1543/415737-micropose_f1gp_game_cover.jpg</image></root>
