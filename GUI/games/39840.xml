<root><id>39840</id><name>Ripple Island</name><description>OverviewRipple Island (occasionally seen translated as "Lipple Island") is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the world using a series of commands, such as "pick up", "walk" or "use".Rather than the usual murder mystery games which were the trend at the time, Ripple Island instead adopts a fantasy storybook setting where smaller humans and friendly animals, such as raccoons and rabbits, co-exist peacefully. The kingdom is threatened by the arrival of Gerogeru, a self-styled Emperor of Darkness and giant frog, after he kidnaps the princess. Kyle, a young boy and the game's protagonist, is attempting to rescue her.The game was never released outside of Japan. It was, however, re-released as part of a Japan-only PS2 compilation based on Sunsoft's works. It also received a manga adaptation.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34684">Famicom Mukashi Banashi: Shin Onigashima</game><game id="40380">Samurai Sword</game><game id="18710">Kaguya-hime Densetsu</game><game id="40534">Shoukoushi Ceddie</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2331041-ripple_island_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
