<root><id>14402</id><name>Legend</name><description>Legend was a SNES game distributed by Arcade Zone, and developed by the German company Softgold. The game is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in the same vein as   Golden Axe and the    Final Fight game series.Legend is played through the eyes of a character seeking to dispose of the leader of the nation of Sellech. The country is lead by Clovious, who is an incompetent and corrupt leader. In order to do this you must harness the power of Beldor, a despot's spirit. Beldor was a previous leader of Sellech, and ruled as a despot.In order to complete this quest to rid Sellech of Clovius you are expected to fight against waves of hostiles. You are able to perform many different kicks and slashes in order to dispose of foes, but you also have access to magic and special, ranged, attacks. When an enemy is defeated, they will drop different items. These items can include food (for replenishing health), and 'magic bags', which replenish your magic and allow you to perform another spell. In the spirit of all good beat-em-ups, a stronger boss lurks in wait at the end of each stage. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14351">Golden Axe</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/827353-01.jpg</image></root>
