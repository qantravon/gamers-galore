Each time your plane passes a pylon on the correct side, the number at the top-middle of the screen gets one unit smaller. To pass a pylon correctly, you go the right of the red pylons and to the left of the blue pylons. Once the number at the top-middle of the screen reaches zero, the game is over and the timer freezes.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/74175/1398760-sky_jinks.jpg</image></root>
