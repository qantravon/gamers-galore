Wars is based on the previous game,     SD Gundam G Generation Spirits, but includes series from Gundam's alternate timelines; this game marks the G Gen debut of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 and Mobile Suit Gundam C.E. 73: Stargazer. Several new features have been added, including Support Attack/Defend and Wars Break. Featured SeriesList of series featured in SD Gundam G Generation Wars.

Currently known Wars Break situations include Gundam 0080 and 08th MS Team characters appearing in a stage for the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and Gundam 00 characters appearing in a stage based on Gundam X.Team Trinity prepares for a combination attack.Combination Attack/Support Attack/Support DefenseNot much information is given on these new features, but they are most likely identical to the similarly-named systems in the     Super Robot Wars series.ExchangeUnits from one series can be exchanged for units from other series with equivalent stats.Character AbilitiesCharacters are now given separate abilities, such as     Newtype.Master CharacterThe Master Character system once again changes the way that non-Original characters are obtained. At the start of the game, the player is asked to choose one Gundam protagonist. That character becomes the "Master Character," and all pilots from their series (or any coinciding unit-only series, such as 08th MS Team and 0080 to the original MSG) are unlocked for purchase. Eventually, you will be able to buy other Master Characters.OP PartsEach mobile suit can now use three OP Parts instead of just one. Also, one-time-use OP Parts are implemented for the first time.Other Changes"Chance Step" (the ability to move again after destroying an enemy) has been limited; unlike     G Generation Portable and Spirits, destroying an enemy will only give you a "Chance Step" the first 3 times. Â The limit increases as the pilot gains levels.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22983">SD Gundam G Generation Spirits</game><game id="22508">Super Robot Wars Z</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5911/1056659-gungwii.jpg</image></root>
