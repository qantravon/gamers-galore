It was released for DOS and came with a level editor. The game starts with a small amount of money and you get more by collecting treasures found in the mine and killing other players. Money is used between levels to buy bigger and badder explosives (like   nuclear bombs and C-4) and better tools for mining.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2007">Worms</game><game id="2991">Boulder Dash</game><game id="2430">Bomberman</game><game id="5712">MoleZ</game><game id="14851">Tunneler</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/32504/1414933-mb2.jpg</image></root>
