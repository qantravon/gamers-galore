Peter's gameplay revolves around a classic 3D beat 'em up, where he must defeat an old enemy, Ernie the giant chicken. Stewie's gameplay is a 3rd person platformer shooter, where he must get the better of his half brother, Bertram. Brian's gameplay is stealth based, where he must clear his name and show Lois's dad Carter Pewterschmidt that he did not get his dog Sea Breeze pregnant.The story line concludes that Peter's real enemy is Ernie the giant chicken, Bertram runs away and Quagmire got the dog pregnant.The final boss of the game is a battle with the infamous giant chicken. The fight takes a long time, as do the fights in the TV series.A " sequel" to this game was announced in an Activision conference call on February 9th, 2011.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6781">The Simpsons Game</game><game id="5899">Futurama</game><game id="36978">South Park: The Stick of Truth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2428396-box_fguy.png</image></root>
