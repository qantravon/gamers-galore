Following in the tracks of its predecessor, Race Drivin' continues with the 3D polygon presentation and provides four different vehicles for the player to use. The player can then select between a racing track and two stunt-focused tracks. Race Drivin' debuted in the Arcades and was converted for many home computers and consoles of the era.Race Drivin' was eventually followed up by Hard Drivin' II.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38678">Road Riot 4WD</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10831/508259-586409_39008_front.jpg</image></root>
