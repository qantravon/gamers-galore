The goal of Creeper World is to build generators and guide power to a warp gate. Once the warp gate is fully powered, the player's city-ship may leave the planet and continue its journey. Hindering this goal is the titular creeper, a mysterious entity which behaves like a fluid, flowing down hills and through valleys. As the creeper accumulates and spreads, the player must build weapons to keep the creeper at bay long enough to gather vital power.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26101">PixelJunk Shooter</game><game id="31341">PixelJunk Shooter 2</game><game id="14676">Perimeter</game><game id="724">Perimeter: Emperor's Testament</game><game id="23447">Perimeter 2: New Earth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/47442/1510244-images2.jpg</image></root>
