<root><id>21659</id><name>Super Bases Loaded</name><description>Gameplay Super Bases Loaded plays similarly to actual American baseball, and is housed under most of the same rule sets: one team hits while the other fields and pitches; four balls pitched outside the invisible hit-box constitutes a free base, while three suitable pitches results in a strike out. While many advanced rules are also in effect (such as bunt-strike outs) others - balks, infield "fly-outs," foul-pole home runs - are curiously absent. Additionally, players controlling the pitcher can deliberately pitch at players, resulting in neither the batter nor pitcher being penalized beyond an extra base. When players swing, however, their hit-boxes are eliminated, allowing pitchers to throw balls through the batter, and still receive a strike. There is a ten-run mercy rule limit in effect at all times, and a game can only last for up to 23 innings. Each pitcher and batter has a unique stance.  Unlike previous entries that largely randomize hits, the game employs a variable physics engine that accounts for timing, bat, and pitch speed, as well as completion of swing, and registered statistics for both the batter and pitcher. Pitchers' speed and accuracy stagnate after every pitch, allowing pitch speeds to range from above 100 mph to below 60. Gravity involving the ball, however, is largely unrealistic, as balls can remain up in the air for periods lasting over 10 seconds. Bunts, especially, can be nearly impossible to execute without being caught. Likewise, lateral ball travel is also markedly sluggish. Baseball can only be played in Bases Loaded Stadium, under the same conditions. The stadium walls are riddled with fake advertisements parodying real-world counterparts. The audience will cheer after every play, with the same enthusiasm, for both teams.The game includes a robust single-player campaign, challenging players to play a "perfect season," or a season composed of eleven perfect games free of runs, hits, and errors. Roster Despite the North American release sporting Ryne Sandberg's endorsement, Super Bases Loaded contains a roster of twelve fictional teams, each with fictional players and statistics. Players can also choose to edit a team together (literally as "Team Edit"). Individual roster statistics can be adjusted to build near-perfect players.
