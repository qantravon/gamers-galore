It was published on the Sega CD by Sega and the PC by Viacom New Media in 1993. The story takes place a few years after the events of Bram Stoker's Dracula and all of the main characters from the novel are represented here. The player assumes the role of Alexander Morris, a wealthy Texan, who travels to Victorian England to investigate the death of his brother Quincey.  As Morris you navigate the city seeking out any and all who may have information about the death of your brother. Each "location" is merely a different film sequence which will offer the player clues and infomation. Unlike the  Sherlock Holmes  games, you must stay aware of time and your inventory. Entering houses with different items in your hand, or at different times of the day will trigger different sequences, and certain pivotal scenes can be missed entirely if you mismanage time.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12998">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</game><game id="1182">Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: Volume II</game><game id="7903">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</game><game id="2448">Rise of the Dragon</game><game id="1792">Bram Stoker's Dracula</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14206/1081024-dc.jpg</image></root>
