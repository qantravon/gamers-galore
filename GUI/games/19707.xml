As the name suggests, the game revolves around competition between the Ford Motor Company and the Chevrolet company. As the game cover art suggests, the flagship models of each company are present: Ford's GT, and the Chevrolet Corvette.   Ford vs Chevy contains forty-eight cars, twenty-four from each manufacturer. You will be asked to choose a side: Ford or Chevy, and then try to win a World Championship, which is dedicated only to these two manufacturers. The cup is called the 'Westington Cup', and to win you will need to upgrade your car with realistic parts from different manufacturers. </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8621">Hummer: Badlands</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="28420">Chrysler: Classic Racing</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803631-box_fvc.png</image></root>
