Sinclaire wishes to use her drug to poison the city of Freeport, utilising her security force SiNtek to do so. Protagonist Col. John Blade sets out to stop Sinclaire, aided by his friend and sidekick J.C. Armack who communicates his mission objectives to him and uses his hacking abilities in situations where Blade's brute force is inadequate.GameplayThe game includes many (for the time) ground-breaking features, including several different ways to complete missions, drivable vehicles, and a high level of interactivity. This ranged from destroying simple objects also it allows access of computers through a "DOS-like prompt".A handful of levels deviated from the typical 'shoot everything' mentality of your average first person shooter. One level involved Blade infiltrating a U4 lab as a scientist. He could avoid the security cameras and sneak past scientists at work in order to grab a lab coat and key in order to access the elevators to the sub levels. Although, you could just burst through with guns blazing if you wanted.Some of the missions could be skipped. There's one such level which was the fantastic missile silo level. Most of the other alternate missions occurred when you completed a secondary objective or failed to complete a primary objective. For example, failing to stop contamination of the primary water supply initiated an additional level where you hurried down the line and shut it off there. The simplest of these involved the first level where shooting an Elexis Sinclaire billboard caused it to crash through the roof of the bank. Once inside the bank you would see the billboard through the roof and the newly damaged fountain flooding the ATM area.WeaponsBlade's arsenal includes a fairly typical FPS layout and most weapons lack a secondary fire. Those that are capable of secondary fire have to be switched back and forth between modes.Fists - The default weapon of the game, used to punch your enemies.Monster's hands - This weapon is used when Blade is injected with U4.Concussion gun - A weapon that recharges its ammo.
