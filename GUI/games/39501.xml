<root><id>39501</id><name>Karateka</name><description>OverviewKarateka is a re-imagining of the 1984 martial arts fighting game of the same name.The game has been stated to have a compact 40-Minute play-through but with an emphasis on replay. You will take on the role of three male characters vying for the love of a princess like in many games. Though the game itself is said not to be too challenging, achieving the princess' hand in marriage is to be more difficult.The combat system features a rhythm-based style and art by Jeff Marsuda, who has previously worked on The Batman and Jackie Chan Adventures.While a Wii U version popped up on the ESRB's website, the game's producer later clarified that version for the system was considered early on but never actually went into development.PC System RequirementsOperating system: Windows XP / Vista / 7/8Processor: Intel Dual Core processor with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHzMemory: 1 GBHard drive space: 1 GBSound device: compatible with DirectXVideo: 256 MB VRAM</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37594">Kung Fu Strike: The Warrior's Rise</game><game id="17976">Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat</game><game id="23965">Punch-Out!!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363157-cover.png</image></root>
