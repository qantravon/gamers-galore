The tracks featured music created exclusively for Chime and provides the largest roster for the series to date.   The goal of chime is to cover a number of different grids with irregular shapes to form 3x3 blocks called quads. Every shape and quad generates musical notes and phrases. As the grid is gradually covered, the song builds up in the background. Players work their way towards 100% coverage as they create a unique remix every time. Multiplayer is a new addition to the series, along with an increase of game grids, complete graphics and gameplay overhaul.   MusicChime Super Deluxe comes with ten playable tracks.
