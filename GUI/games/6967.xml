Rob Schneider stars as the voice of the protagonist.Prior to release, Any River Entertainment was dissolved. Given the game's commercial failures and the typical amount of investment needed to produce an FMV game primarily voiced by a celebrity, one can conclude that A Fork in the Tale was, at least in part, responsible for the publisher's demise.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8169">Urban Runner</game><game id="737">Brain Dead 13</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/136461/2530829-forkinthetale.jpg</image></root>
