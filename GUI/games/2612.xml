The fourth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom crossover series (and sequel to Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes), the game doubles the roster of the previous installment while adding new 3-on-3 gameplay and simplified controls (two punch buttons, two kick buttons, and two assist buttons). The game brings back the classic "assist attack" system (sans "partners") while adding a new "snapback" attack (a close-ranged attack that, if hit successfully, swaps the opponent's character with another). These additions, along with the over-the-top action and crazy combos, help the game maintain a prominent role in the tournament scene in the 00's.It was released for the Dreamcast and later ported to both the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. At first, the Xbox version was to have Xbox Live on it, but because of a contract conflict, which said they could not alter the game at all, they had to remove that.XBLA  PSN VersionsMarvel vs. Capcom 2 arrived to Xbox LIVE Arcade, as part of the "Summer of Arcade" campaign, on July 29, 2009.
