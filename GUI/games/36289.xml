This can be accomplished by building stations and stops during the day, and setting up individual train schedules at night. As the player's routes become more successful and more used, buildings and communities will start to spring up around the map, which in turn will allow the player to build more tracks and stations.The game offers five unique scenarios for play, including: A tutorial for new players, three intermediate scenarios for more skilled users, and an advanced mode for veteran players.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/50065/1877855-a_ressadeikoumdjpboxshotgenesis.jpg</image></root>
