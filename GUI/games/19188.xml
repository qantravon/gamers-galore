It has the elements of the first 2 improving combat with new vehicles and has several racing sequences.GameplayTy 3 is very similar to the previous entries, but it adds some tweaks to the weapon system. The new system allows the player to customize a boomerang chassis with items called Bunyip Stones. The stones augment the player's boomerang with various abilities and effects. Some of these effects include an elemental damage modifier, a stone that slows down time, and even one that allows for an extremely long range throw akin to a sniper shot.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8035">Dr. Muto</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="6649">Super Mario Sunshine</game><game id="20351">Kya: Dark Lineage</game><game id="11470">Scaler</game><game id="15835">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</game><game id="20529">Insecticide</game><game id="12614">Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy</game><game id="24969">Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri</game><game id="11407">Vexx</game><game id="17133">Tak and the Power of Juju</game><game id="25720">Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier</game><game id="19388">Ape Escape 3</game><game id="30746">Ruff Trigger: The Vanocore Conspiracy</game><game id="159">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue</game><game id="13169">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261155-box_ty3.png</image></root>
