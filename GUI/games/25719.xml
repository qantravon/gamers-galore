First Frights</name><description>OverviewGameplay centers around mashing on the attack button and doing some basic platforming, in order to solve obvious mysteries. The story itself is skimp, and meaningful exposition is not given to the Gang's adventure. It also seems the developers' probably never watched an episode of Scooby-Doo!, as many of the hallmarks of the series, such as Velma's uncannily smart and concise explanation for mysteries, upon their conclusion, are missing.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9039/1141466-scoobydoo.jpg</image></root>
