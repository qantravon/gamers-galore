It is the third game in the series, and the first for the Super Nintendo. As with its forebears, Koutei no Chousen takes a semi-turn-based RPG format in which the player selects commands dependent on whether they have possession of the ball. The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.Besides the customary graphical upgrade from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21685">Inazuma Eleven</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48222/2202260-captaintsubaba3boxshotsnes.jpg</image></root>
