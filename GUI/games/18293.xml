<root><id>18293</id><name>Renegade</name><description>Renegade is a beat 'em up game using 2D sprites that can move in three  dimensions. It uses a system of a fixed location where the player has to  fend off waves of opponents until their numbers dwindle, and the stage boss appears to intervene. Two sequels to Renegade were made: Target: Renegade and Renegade 3: The  Final Chapter. Neither of the sequels were developed by Technos.   Renegade (as an arcade game) is notable for being a western localisation of Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun. The notability is that the sprite and stage changes are heavily influenced by the 1979 film 'The Warriors'. No lawsuit was ever made against the game for such similarities.Renegade uses various gameplay techniques (ways to attack opponents) that were progressive for beat-em ups of its ilk. These included reverse attacks (attacking an opponent behind the player), grab attacks and the ability to 'mount' and attack downed enemies. It could be argued that even much later games in the style, such as Final Fight, were influenced by Renegade.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6608">River City Ransom</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game><game id="2536">Altered Beast</game><game id="15143">Knights of the Round</game><game id="1618">The Ninja Warriors</game><game id="2840">Sonic Blast Man</game><game id="16610">Burning Fight</game><game id="5231">Final Fight CD</game><game id="9917">P.O.W.: Prisoners of War</game><game id="4146">Vigilante</game><game id="14304">Sengoku</game><game id="5546">Sengoku 2</game><game id="13074">Sengoku 3</game><game id="4378">Fallen Angel</game><game id="20754">Double Dragon Advance</game><game id="5423">Double Dragon II</game><game id="42954">Fist Puncher</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg</image></root>
