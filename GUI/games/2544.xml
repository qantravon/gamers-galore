It was developed by Team17 and published by THQ for the Nintendo DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable. Worms: Open Warfare is where teams of worm soldiers fight it out in over-the-top cartoon battles featuring an abundance of weird and wacky weapons. Players can take out their opponents with anything ranging from machine guns, to bizarre weapons like exploding sheep, and with more than 20 different weapons there are plenty to use whether it be in close quarters combat or long range. The game is played in rounds with each of your Worms starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms in a turn-based system. You have 60 seconds per turn to move your worm around the battlefield and attack the opposing worms with each worm having one attack per turn.The game was released on PlayStation Portable in the USA on March 20, 2006 and on Nintendo DS on March 22, 2006.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18822">Worms World Party</game><game id="20860">Worms: A Space Oddity</game><game id="17255">Worms Armageddon</game><game id="522">Worms 3D</game><game id="14285">Age of Empires: The Age of Kings</game><game id="11999">Worms Forts: Under Siege</game><game id="12653">Scorched Earth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1798150-box_wormsow.png</image></root>
