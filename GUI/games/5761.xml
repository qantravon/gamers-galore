Core gameplay consisted of trade off control among four players, and a quite ahead of its time item/upgrade/character/control interface allowing the player easy control over all four characters in combat. The item/upgrade system was very reminiscent of Diablo II, while the gameplay had more of a Legend of Zelda feel.Settings include haunted mansions, schools, space, hell, grocery stores and ancient valleys. A total of eight playable characters are unlocked throughout the course of the game.Blood Zero is written in an old version of the Visual Basic runtime and is difficult to get running on modern PCs.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20372">Zombie Smashers X</game><game id="844">Zombie Smashers X2: Punx and Skins</game><game id="19963">Zombie Smashers X3: Ninjastarmageddon!</game><game id="19943">Yuki's Vacation</game><game id="20253">Survival Crisis Z</game><game id="34877">ZP2KX: Zombies and Pterodactyls</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
