Players are also able to obtain various pick-ups strewn across the map to use to their advantage. The game sets down a survival of the fittest objective, in which the last man standing wins. Players can choose to either play against bots in a series of matches in story mode, or battle up to four friends in a split screen versus mode.DevelopmentInstead of being developed by Single Trac, the developer for the first two games, or Incog Inc, the developers of Black and Head On, Twisted Metal 3 was developed by Sony's in-house studio, 989 Studios, along with Twisted Metal 4. Because of this, most hardcore Twisted Metal fans don't see Twisted Metal 3 or 4 as true Twisted Metal games.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7468">Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense</game><game id="13200">Vigilante 8</game><game id="10616">Streets of SimCity</game><game id="4315">WWE Crush Hour</game><game id="14204">Mashed: Drive to Survive</game><game id="23277">Vigilante 8 Arcade</game><game id="9733">RoadKill</game><game id="23527">Hardware 2</game><game id="16728">Powerslide</game><game id="25512">Clutch</game><game id="23930">Wild Metal</game><game id="5917">Cyber Sled</game><game id="18499">Motor Mayhem</game><game id="12975">Super Chase H.Q.</game><game id="16473">Breakneck</game><game id="37266">Smash 'n' Survive</game><game id="28960">Metal Drift</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2011581-box_tmetal3.png</image></root>
