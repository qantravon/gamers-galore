<root><id>16538</id><name>Sega Casino</name><description>A by-the-book casino game developed by  TOSE for Sega.  Sega Casino starts you off with access to five casino games:  Blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, and Texas hold'em.  With your initial $1000 bank, you must unlock the other four games -- seven card stud, keno, chuck a luck, and video poker -- as well as the higher stakes tables of the original games. Sega Casino's graphics are well done, if minimal.  Unlike other casino games, Sega Casino contains no casino atmosphere or unique NPC characters.  The only thing you ever see are the game tables, which, while not fantastic, certainly manage quite well. Perhaps the major disapointment of Sega Casino is that it is all casino, and no Sega.  Sega, and Sonic Team especially, have been including casino-themed levels and elements in their games at least since Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  Perhaps because it was developed by 'stealth developers' TOSE rather than an internal Sega team, Sega Casino contains nothing that is distinctly Sega.  There are no character appearences, music remixes, or anything else that would let you know that this is anything other than a bargain price casino title.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12873">Casino!</game><game id="24601">World Series of Poker</game><game id="30051">Stacked with Daniel Negreanu</game><game id="32302">Super Caesar's Palace</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11512/1094650-sega_casino.jpg</image></root>
