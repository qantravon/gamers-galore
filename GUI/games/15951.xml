The game is a sequel to the  Sega CD game sharing an awfully similar title,  Mansion of Hidden Souls.  "The Mansion slowly appears, framed against the night sky while momentarily the full moon disappears behind a drifting cloud. As the wind gently removes the cloud, the moon reappears.....dyed blood red!"  You are Jun, summoned by the Elder of the Mansion who has a premonition of what might be happening at the Mansion. He selects you to investigate along with Mike, another resident. Jun can see the 'butterfly-shaped souls' of those in the mansion and talk to them to gain clues, in order to unveil the hidden side of the Mansion.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3970">Myst</game><game id="16230">Riven: The Sequel to Myst</game><game id="3779">D</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14206/1780802-mansat.jpg</image></root>
