They've made the jump to the PS3 and Xbox 360 have left the Wii behind in the process. They've also moved away from the cartoon-ish art style that was used in the previous Wii version, and have adopted a more realistic look for the sequel, in line with other EA Sports franchises such as FIFA and NHL.Along with this visual upgrade comes a new feature: the "Total Racquet Control" system, which allows you to perform all of your swings with the right analog stick. The game also boasts a 20+ roster size which will include past legends such as John McEnroe, Pat Cash and Bj√∂rn Borg and current players like Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and the Williams sisters. A new feature called "P.R.O. AI" will capture the authentic play styles and behaviors of each member of the roster, including their signature swings. "ESPN Grand Slam Classics" is a mode that will allow you to replay 25 of tennis' most historic moments, as some of the sport's most memorable players.Other new features include a 10-year career mode, online versus play, and the return of the four major tennis tournaments, the Grand Slams: the Australian Open, U.S. Open, French Open, and Wimbledon. The Playstation 3 version of Grand Slam Tennis 2 also features Playstation Move support.RosterGrand Slam Tennis 2 features more than 20 players, past and present, for you to play with.ATP MenRoger FedererRafael NadalNovak DjokovicAndy MurrayLleyton HewittJo-Wilfried TsongaKei NishikoriWTA WomenVenus WilliamsSerena WilliamsMaria SharapovaAna IvanovicATP LegendsBoris BeckerBjorn BorgStefan EdbergPat CashJohn McEnroePete SamprasMichael StichWTA LegendsLindsay DavenportChris EvertJustine HeninMartina Navratilova</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="25">Tennis</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21822">Smash Court Tennis: Pro Tournament 2</game><game id="32594">Top Spin 4</game><game id="32369">Virtua Tennis 4</game><game id="14977">Tennis 2K2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2136547-box_gst2.png</image></root>
