<root><id>20177</id><name>Captain Quazar</name><description>Captain Quazar was an isometric shooter in the same vein as arcade titles, such as Smash TV. Gameplay consisted of the player mowing down numerous waves of assorted enemies. The character portrays the brave, yet somewhat dense, Captain Quazar as he attempts to save the planet from an alien scourge. The game relied heavily on a rather funny intro and humorous cutscenes to balance out the, in the opinion of many, rather difficult game play.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/46/347913-captainquazarfrontcover.jpg</image></root>
