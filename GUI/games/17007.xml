The game is notable in that it features heavy anime influences, as seen in the in-game cutscenes. After home runs and during close plays in the field, cutscenes occur, showing the action. Also of note are the Bunny umpires, and attention to detail in the rosters. Teams and players are modeled after MLB teams, complete with similar color schemes and player attributes.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6751">Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball</game><game id="16272">Tecmo Baseball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9279/277708-bad_news_cover.jpg</image></root>
