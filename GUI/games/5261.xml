Knockout Boxing climaxes with the player taking on Buster Douglas for the heavyweight championship.  As a part of the career mode, player-created boxers' skills would degrade over time, making late-career bouts difficult when facing the new fighters coming up just as the player had.  The player's career concludes with his retirement after 30 matches.TriviaBy inputting "THEBEAST" as the name of a player-created boxer, the player would be rewarded with a fully maxed-out fighter with green skin bearing a strong resemblance to The Incredible Hulk.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="20">Boxing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10992">Final Blow</game><game id="17218">Riddick Bowe Boxing</game><game id="1031">Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing</game><game id="3318">Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing</game><game id="13997">George Foreman's KO Boxing</game><game id="1260">Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11059/274826-buster.jpg</image></root>
