One of the titles in the short-lived Lula porn game franchise, the game is one of small handful of games to ever receive an AO rating from the ESRB.The game, which follows a former bank robber-turned porn director, is filled with crudely drawn nudity, depictions of sex, and cartoon bimbos with chest sizes never under a D-cup.PlotFollowing a bank robbery/cop killing in a small Nevada town, a two-bit nameless loser is double-crossed by his partner and lady-friend. As a manhunt ensues for him and the other robbers, he checks into a hotel in the podunk desert town of Wetrock and slips into a bottle of tequila. Sitting by the poolside, he meets a sultry aspiring actress named Lula. Failing to break into the film industry, despite having sex with countless producers, Lula had scraped some money together and planned to make a name for herself in Las Vegas.After being treated to night of wild sex, our hero has an idea. He plans to make a star out of the 'talented' Lula by directing a series of porn videos staring her and other locals. Meanwhile, he must avoid capture by the FBI for his involvement in the heist.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3515">The Guy Game</game><game id="5706">Lula 3D</game><game id="19700">Wet Attack: The Empire Cums Back</game><game id="20002">Lula Virtual Babe</game><game id="33437">Sexy Beach</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1049435-lula___the_sexy_empire_coverart.png</image></root>
