It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win.Family Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="25">Tennis</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20780">Tennis</game><game id="23133">Super Family Tennis</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/112/701643-front.jpg</image></root>
