Pots will fall from the top of the screen, and the player will attempt to match the same pots in stacks on the bottom of the screen. Getting 5 of the same pots stacked together will clear those pots from the board, freeing up space.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16455">Klax</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/804897-1127464024_00.png</image></root>
