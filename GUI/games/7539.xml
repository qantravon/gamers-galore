In the single player mode players could play as both Rikimaru and Ayame from the start and a third playable character, Tesshu, was unlocked once the game had been completed. Tesshu was different from the original characters in that he did not start missions with a traditional weapon and instead used his bare hands. Wrath of Heaven also featured a co-op mission mode, in which players could initiate dual assassinations on enemies, and a competitive mode in which players could select from a variety of characters which appear in the game, each with their own specific move sets.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16140">Metal Gear Solid</game><game id="18082">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</game><game id="9594">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</game><game id="12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</game><game id="5961">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</game><game id="457">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent</game><game id="20464">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction</game><game id="13667">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Essentials</game><game id="12354">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</game><game id="15549">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</game><game id="7004">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</game><game id="4523">Thief: The Dark Project</game><game id="7787">Thief II: The Metal Age</game><game id="7345">Red Ninja: End of Honor</game><game id="21227">Metal Gear Solid</game><game id="598">Shinobido: Way of the Ninja</game><game id="24155">Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja</game><game id="21654">Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</game><game id="6601">Hitman: Contracts</game><game id="11004">Hitman: Blood Money</game><game id="6709">Hitman: Codename 47</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2215090-box_tenchuwoh.png</image></root>
