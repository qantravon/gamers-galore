The enemies start out firing a few bullets at your ship. The amount enemy fire rapidly increases as you progress through to the next waves. Certain enemies fire tracking missile-like projectiles that can shoot additional bullets. (I'm using the term bullets even though the weapons are most likely energy based; it is space.)</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="16120">Space Armada</game><game id="9694">Megamania</game><game id="12834">Alien Invaders - Plus!</game><game id="14030">Demons to Diamonds</game><game id="15941">Demon Attack</game><game id="23504">Vector Vaders</game><game id="12744">Chicken Invaders</game><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="13424">Cheesy Invaders</game><game id="1293">CHAMP Invaders</game><game id="16123">Beamrider</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/571997-juno_first__sony_konami__front.jpg</image></root>
