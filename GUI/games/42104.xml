Despite being set in the middle of the story, the DLC can only be started separately; the main game still skips the DLC content during a regular playthrough. It is set after the events in China when Adam Jensen went as stowaway on a ship. The original game blends out for three days and this add-on tells what happened during this time. Jensen finds himself captured on a Belltower ship, ready to be tortured. Fortunately a mysterious hacker frees him and now Jensen needs to uncover the conspiracies of his surroundings.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Role-Playing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10075-1.jpg</image></root>
