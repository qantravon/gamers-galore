<root><id>8865</id><name>The Goonies</name><description>OverviewEach level is loosely based on specific events from the movie and has you solving puzzles and over coming obstacles as a pair of characters from the film. You are required to use both characters in tandem to hit switches and distract enemies. It has often been credited as a precursor to modern team based puzzlers such as "The Lost Vikings".The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story. While the sequel was a well-known US NES release, the only release The Goonies received for a Nintendo platform was as an exclusive Disk Writer title for the Famicom Disk System. Games that were only accessible via the Disk Writer system have no case/manual and are notoriously difficult to find for collectors.Later however, there was a cartridge release for the Famicom which is more readily available, but this was not released in the west either.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12806">The Humans: Meet the Ancestors</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1702925-656_1.jpg</image></root>
