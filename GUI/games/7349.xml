Unlike the first game, you now could choose among all of the legendary heavyweight boxers, including Holyfield in the game. The core game is the same. The game still had big 2D sprites in a 3D rotational ring concept. Only the game has more modes. Instead of just a career mode, the game also had a tournament mode where you could pick a legendary boxer, and see if you could defeat the other legendary boxers in the game. Fighters included in the game are, Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, Floyd Patterson, Rocky Marciano, Larry Holmes, and many others.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27106">Joe Montana's NFL Football</game><game id="1031">Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing</game><game id="13997">George Foreman's KO Boxing</game><game id="3318">Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing</game><game id="27622">Mike Tyson Boxing</game><game id="17218">Riddick Bowe Boxing</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8153/951534-heavymi9.jpg</image></root>
