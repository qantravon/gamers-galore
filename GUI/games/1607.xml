<root><id>1607</id><name>Claymates</name><description>Claymates is a platformer released in 1993. It is the sister game to Clay Fighter although neither release shared any characters or plot points. The game had players playing as Clayton a scientist's son who is turned into a ball of clay by a nefarious looking fellow for unclear reasons. As a clayball Clayton does not have very many skills but he can grab other colored clayballs to turn into different animals. The game is your standard hop and bop adventure otherwise, only done entirely in clay.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16228">Uniracers</game><game id="34094">Jelly Boy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363705-snes_claymates.jpg</image></root>
