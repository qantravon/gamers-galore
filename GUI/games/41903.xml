Perseus Mandate</name><description>Just after ATC murders Aldus Bishop and openly begins to battle against F.E.A.R. and Delta Force, Commander Betters airdrops a second F.E.A.R. team to ATC's secondary facility to investigate the company and any wrongdoing it is involved with. This second F.E.A.R. team consists of Captain David Raynes, Lt. Steve Chen, and the unnamed F.E.A.R. Sergeant (the player character). After battling through Replica soldiers and ATC security forces, the second F.E.A.R. team discover that a third faction has already infiltrated the ATC facility and killed everyone inside. This faction consists of highly-trained mercenaries known as "Nightcrawlers", who are armed with advanced weapons. The Nightcrawler ranks also include several elite super-soldiers who possess the same SloMo ability previously demonstrated by the F.E.A.R. Pointman.</description><genres><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/4111-2.jpg</image></root>
