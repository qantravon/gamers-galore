Developed by Cyanide Studio and published by Focus Home Interactive, the 2011 edition features a number of overhauls in terms of graphics and user interface. Players can choose to take part in single races or manage their team over the course of the season, looking after various aspects such as the team's organisation, finances and relationships with sponsors.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/65194/1818630-61zrxhjucal.jpg</image></root>
