The Wii Remote can be tilted to move Dewy, with the D-pad changing his temperature to hot or cold. While in hot mode, Dewy becomes a thunder cloud, allowing him to shock enemies. While in cold mode, Dewy turns into ice, allowing him to slide more quickly, and perform a normal three hit combo.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7247">Super Monkey Ball</game><game id="24715">I-Fluid</game><game id="20399">Elebits</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/361536-dewy_s_adventure_us.jpg</image></root>
