These fights are depicted as one-on-one turn-based struggles where the player and creature's health is depicted as candles. Kagekiyo can regenerate health at shrines by spending money and can also level up stats at torii gates by spending "toku", or virtue. Both money and toku are earned defeating enemies.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game><game id="12131">Getsu Fuuma Den</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2359553-genpei_touma_den_fc.jpg</image></root>
