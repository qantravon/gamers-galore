Due to a 64 character limitation, and the Atari's own RAM size, only extremely simple programs could be written and executed. Intended as a learning tool, Basic Programming was not intended for serious programming, indeed, there is no way to permanently store a program once written, as the Atari lacks recordable media. </description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367654-2600_basicprogramming.jpg</image></root>
