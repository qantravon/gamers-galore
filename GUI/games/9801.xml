Each level challenges you to rescue one of Beethoven and Missy's puppies, and is divided up into 2 stages each. In the first stage your objective is to get to the puppy while in the second, you must carry the puppy back to Missy.   As Beethoven your main attack is barking, which releases supersonic waves that can devastate man or beast.  Barks can be "charged" by growling, resulting in even greater destructive power.  Beethoven can also shake water off of his body in order to hit enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19729">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Stimpy's Invention</game><game id="5173">Bebe's Kids</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13636/600068-beethoven_s_2nd_00004.jpg</image></root>
