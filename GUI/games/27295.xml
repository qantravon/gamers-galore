It was released under the Play THQ banner, normally used for THQ's family-friendly software.ReceptionVery few professional outlets have reviewed Up for Playstation 2. Notably, IGN awarded it a 5.8 "Mediocre" in theirreview, stating:"If you enjoyed Pixarâ€™s brilliant film, Up the game is disappointing on PlayStation 2. It will keep the good times rolling for the younger audience for a few hours at the most but the experience has some complications that will stump younger children. The ease of jumping in and out of cooperative play is appreciated but the majority of the game is woefully far from fun."</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7932">DreamWorks' Shark Tale</game><game id="20667">Flushed Away</game><game id="20640">Kung Fu Panda</game><game id="11120">LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga</game><game id="32196">Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet</game><game id="3655">Shrek the Third</game><game id="38679">Up</game><game id="26502">Aliens in the Attic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1824064-box_up.png</image></root>
