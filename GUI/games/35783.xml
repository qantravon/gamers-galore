It's a direct sequel to  Cabela's Dangerous Hunts and builds on the previous game. The title offers a greater variety of environments ranging the wooden tundra to snowy plains. The game will offer multiple scenarios where "decisions" will have to be made. like in previous games, these decisions usually center around whether or not to shoot at an animal, knowing that if you miss it will get away but also knowing that if you don't take the shot, there may not be another chance. The game features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted.The game also features multiplayer where players compete to hunt the rarest animals and the player can also customize the weapon for each type of situation (said weapon is usually a variation of a scoped hunting rifle). The game is planned to be released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36741">Hunting Unlimited 2011</game><game id="37179">Hunter's Trophy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2360859-box_cbgh12.png</image></root>
