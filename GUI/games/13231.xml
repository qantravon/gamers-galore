Now, they have to make their way back to the base. The game is constituted of three core game elements. The first one is the overland map where the player will have to choose the path to take. Some of the options are safer than others but might take longer. Once the player has chosen, the game plays a handful of 'cutscenes' (consisting of very evocative stills). Finally, every now and then, the squad will be have to face a challenge which is played out in the form of a mini-game or arcade segment, such as shooting enemies hiding in the jungle etc. All the while, you have to keep an eye on your soldiers morale, health, food  water levels etc. and try not to loose them or make them go AWOL. The game lacked deep gameplay but made up for it with a haunting soundtrack (composed by German synth-band Kraftwerk) and gorgeous graphics for the time.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19613">Seal Team</game><game id="17723">Vietcong</game><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="16819">Navy Seals</game><game id="14750">Airborne Ranger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/742462-lost_patrol_01.jpg</image></root>
