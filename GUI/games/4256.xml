You come up to the shrine and attempt to ask the 'shrine-master' if he will regenerate you a monster. He tells you he can't at this time and to come back later. You meet your beautiful blue haired companion lady who says she shall help you. She tells the Shrine Master that she is actually your master and you are the apprentice. He agrees to help you after some convincing arguments by your new companion. You then get to choose a disc and regenerate yourself a monster. Time to ranch those monsters...3!Character CreationMonster Rancher 3's character creation system focused on the player putting in different game/dvd disks to create characters. Depending on the disk, the game would scan it and create a character from it.
