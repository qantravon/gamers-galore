<root><id>9998</id><name>Betty Bad</name><description>Betty Bad was a third-person action game owing almost all gameplay inspiration to Tempest. The protagonist Betty Bad would move along the inside or outside of tubes killing approaching robotic insects and had no control over the camera. The only direction a player could move was forward, and each level was traversing yet another tube. Originally retailing for $20, it was discontinued by the developer and publisher WildTangent some time after release. An offline demo is still readily available from various file repositories for those interested in experiencing almost everything this title has to offer.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13984">Tempest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9778/1765516-8426_full.jpg</image></root>
