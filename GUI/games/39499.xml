The game is partly a graphic/text adventure game of the sort that were popular in Japan on home computers at the time, such as Portopia or Ohotsuku no Kiyu, and part RPG with its turn-based battles in the Dragon Quest mold.GameplayPlayers move around Cairo and other Egyptian locations such as a tomb and a tower in a front-person view, popularized by Wizardry and imitated in many early Japanese RPGs. Players can talk to people, gather clues, rest at inns and purchase new weapons and armor. Unlike most RPGs, the player character does not get stronger from levelling up; they simply gain more hit points. Stats like attack and defense (which are inexplicably hidden from the player) are determined entirely by the equipment worn.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="39306">Deep Dungeon II: Yuushi no Monshou</game><game id="9180">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</game><game id="28876">Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364869-fds_cleopatranomahou_jp.jpg</image></root>
