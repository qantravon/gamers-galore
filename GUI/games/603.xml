The Tiger's Claw must follow the weapon deep into Kilrathi space to find the deaded Sivar. Critical ReceptionWhen the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 5,5,5,5 and 5 out of ten.  Mike Weigand wrote, "This is the second Wing Commander game for the SNES, and it falls short of the original.  The scrolling and action is incredibly choppy plus gets very distracting.  This was a good idea, but it just didn't turn out very well".</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10309">Descent: Freespace - The Great War</game><game id="18483">Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger</game><game id="22334">Light Speed</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364703-snes_wingcommanderthesecretmissions.jpg</image></root>
