If you feed and take care of it, the parrot will make  feathers that can be sold. With this money, you can buy new animals at the 'Farmer's Market' and purchase equipment from 'The Shopkeeper.' Little by little, as your farm builds up, you will unlock bonuses, including a  well, a great green macaw, a  guard dog, and a 4x4. You can also exchange animals with your friends who play 'My Farm' or 'My Exotic Farm.'</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26398">My Farm Around the World</game><game id="34253">My Farm</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11660/1510328-mef_artwork1.jpg</image></root>
