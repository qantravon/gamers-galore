Ploughing fields, planting seeds and harvesting fields are order of the day here. As you collect gold from your harvests you level up enabling you to buy a greater variety of crops and decorations for your kingdom.  All crop growth occurs in realtime wether the app is active or not on your iPhone and crops only have a limited time to be harvested once they have matured. Push notifications let you know when your crops are ready for harvesting and your taxes are ready for collecting.  You can also invite facebook/twitter friends to take up residence in your neighbouring  kingdoms.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31033">GodFinger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19275/1309230-we_rule.png</image></root>
