The game is set in a a fantasy island world that can be traversed seamlessly without any loading screens. You can use hot air pockets to lift your self, and literally glide to any of the 5 islands. Because the game is all about gliding, the only source of propulsion is hot air and powerups.  The goal of the game is to collect various colored gems in each of the islands. There are also challenges which are scattered around in the form of colored platforms. Some of these require you to complete a gliding run in a certain amount of time, while others require you to simply fly from one platform to another. Collecting gems will unlock various parts of the different islands.  There is no official end to the game, and there is no story outside of the initial premise. There are achievements that are earned in-game.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15284/1335957-glyder_title.jpg</image></root>
