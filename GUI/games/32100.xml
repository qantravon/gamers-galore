Variants on the basic mechanics include levels where gravity affects the trajectory of the pulses, as well as blocks that can only be removed in non-traditional fashion, such as dropping them out of the bottom of the grid or eliminating a certain-colored block next to them.System RequirementsPC System RequirementsMac System RequirementsOS: Windows 2000 or later, 32 or 64 bitProcessor: 1.4Ghz CPU minimum, 1.8 Ghz recommended for background animation or multiplayerMemory: 512 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)Graphics: : 800x600 or greater screen resolution (32 bit color, 1280x720 recommended)DirectX®: N/AHard Drive: 600MBSound: No special requirementsOther Requirements: Internet Connection or LAN required for networked multiplayer.
