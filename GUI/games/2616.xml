Morgan and Keith S. Kiyohara between 1980-81, with sound effects by Phil Landmeier. It was originally released as a ROMpak cartridge for the Color Computer, which due to the limitations of the hardware meant that the size of the code to could only be a maximum of eight kilobytes. This problem meant that the designers had to do several months of recoding to adapt the game to run on the lower specification. Despite this issue, the game managed to feature a multi-level maze and relatively advanced sound effects, which helped to provide important clues to the locations of monsters.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38030">3D Monster Maze</game><game id="23137">Maze War</game><game id="14233">3-Demon</game><game id="22770">Bard's Tale</game><game id="1295">Wizardry: Llylgamyn Saga</game><game id="16625">Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5028/2184391-dungeons_of_daggorath.jpg</image></root>
