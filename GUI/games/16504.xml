<root><id>16504</id><name>Commander Keen: Keen Dreams</name><description>Keen Dreams used the same engine as the later half of the original Keen series. While its physics and graphics resemble the later games, there are some significant gameplay differences. Some of these include: - The noticeable difference from the later gamess in the series, is that Commander Keen can only stun the enemies temporarily in Keen Dreams. - The pogostick is completely absent, forcing Commander Keen to rely on regular jumping exclusively. Â Commander Keen: Keen Dreams was not given an officiel episode number, and is thus considered an in-between episode fitting between the older episodes (1-3) and the newer ones (4-6).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2352/220003-keen_dreams_boxart.jpg</image></root>
