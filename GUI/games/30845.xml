The internet play is enabled by OpenFeint.  GameplayUnlike other Pictionary games, Depict does not require you to type out the answer to the image being drawn. Instead, you are offered 2-6 words at the bottom of the screen that relate to the image the artist is supposed to draw. You are only allowed one guess, and you receive points based on how fast you answer correctly compared to the other players. The artist drawing the image receives points based on how many people answer correctly.  You are able to rate images on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Based on their ratings, the best images are used in the Lightning Round mode, which shows a series of images drawn by other users, and you must identify them as fast as possible 60 seconds. To try to keep from innapropriaate content, a whistle system is used to flag people who try to cheat or draw adult content.  Free-to-PlayDepict is on of the many  free-to-play titles for the iDevices. You can play the game for free, but not all content is unlocked.
