<root><id>34663</id><name>Mahjong Kazoku</name><description>OverviewMahjong Kazoku ("Mahjong Family") is a standard Mahjong simulation game for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game.Irem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems. </description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39510">Family Mahjong</game><game id="39603">Ide Yosuke Meijin no Jissen Mahjong</game><game id="44225">Super Mahjong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/1750086-1.jpg</image></root>
