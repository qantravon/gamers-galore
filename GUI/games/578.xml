<root><id>578</id><name>Final Zone</name><description>OverviewFZ Zenki Axis (Final Zone) is the third game in the Final Zone series and is something of a spin-off, since it radically changes the perspective of the game and focuses the action by removing most of the previous games' story elements (such as dialogue between characters).Though frequently mistaken as the first Final Zone, with the TurboGrafx-CD game Final Zone II as its sequel, the truth is that this game was developed independently from Final Zone II yet still part of the same franchise. Telenet switched developers after the original Final Zone (which was only available on Japanese home computers and never left the country), with that game's original developers Wolf Team working on this spin-off while Telenet's internal studio Renovation created Final Zone II.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370560-genesis_finalzone.jpg</image></root>
