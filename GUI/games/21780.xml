Various locales include New York, New Zealand and Machu Picchu.

The gameplay is entirely platforming and fighting with Carmen's robot army.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1799352-box_cstsotsd.png</image></root>
