<root><id>8456</id><name>An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire</name><description>GameplayLike the main Elder Scrolls games, Battlespire is a first-person role-playing game. The player character is a Battlemage apprentice, awaiting their final test in the Battlespire, a magic academy situated in a void between Oblivion and the mortal world.Battlespire takes place in the time of the first Elder Scrolls game, Arena. Instead of Tamriel, the entire game takes place in the Battlespire. Even though it uses the same engine as Daggerfall, the gameplay differs greatly:there are no merchants or currency, leaving the player to find items and resourcesthere is no rest feature to allow health regenerationenemies do not respawn when killedthe world is not open, but split into 7 large levelsThis makes the game more difficult as every resource becomes highly valuable.Originally the game was planned as an expansion for Daggerfall, but in the end it was released as a stand-alone game. Battlespire features an improved rendering engine, higher resolution, and much more detailed 3D environment.PC System RequirementsCPU: Pentium 133MHz ProcessorGraphics: SVGA, VESA 2 Compliant Video CardMemory : 16MB RAMHanddisk: 150MB Hard Disk SpaceSound: Sound Blaster compatible Sound CardOther : 4X CD-ROM Drive, Mouse</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22548">Hexen</game><game id="10469">Heretic</game><game id="15660">Hexen II</game><game id="31367">Necromancer Rising</game><game id="15065">Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20011/1772862-battlespire__game_box_cover_.jpg</image></root>
