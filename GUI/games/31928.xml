The playing field is split into halves, and is filled with obstacles, including bumpers (similar in style to pinball) and arrows that force your spaceship in a particular direction. Games last five minutes.A spaceship can shoot projectiles at the opponent, but doing so is rather ineffective. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/1791355-space_football__u_.jpg</image></root>
