<root><id>26656</id><name>Def Jam Rapstar</name><description>OverviewDef Jam Rapstar is a music/rhythm game from 4mm Games and Terminal Reality released in 2010. The game gives players the ability to rap along with a wide variety of hip hop tracks spanning three decades and including some of the genre's most famous artists.GameplayDef Jam Rapstar requires a microphone (bundled with the game) and a controller for navigation. The music video for each song (or, in a few cases where no video is available, a simple volume meter visualizer) appears in a box in the center of the screen while the lyrics are displayed below. A bouncing ball touches each syllable in rhythm, much like some karaoke machines or sing-along videos. Sections that require singing display pitch lines much like Rock Band or Lips, and the player is graded on their tonality as well as rhythm.In Career Mode, there are five stages to be played through, each increasing in difficulty and containing unique score, timing, or other challenges where new songs can be unlocked. A Party mode is available to allow quickplay of unlocked songs (all but a few songs are unlocked from the start of the game), and playlists can be created and performed. The game supports two microphones for Duets and Rap Battles. A Freestyle mode is also available, and gives players an instrumental beat to strut their stuff over.The game features support for the Xbox 360 Kinect and Playstation Eye cameras, allowing users to record video of their performances (limited to 30 seconds), store them locally, and upload them to the community for viewing by others with the game or on the official website. As the player progresses through the game, new video and audio effects, filters, stickers and more can be unlocked.Def Jam Rapstar features radio edits of each song in order to stay within a "T" ESRB rating, but while the harshest of profanities are removed, references to drugs, alcohol, and violence are left intact. The bouncing ball still hits the empty syllables where the profanity used to be, and players are not penalized for speaking the censored words into the microphone.CommunityBefore the lawsuits, Def Jam Rapstar featured an online community where players could prove their swagger. The community was accessible both in-game and on the web at defjamrapstar.com. Players could upload videos from their console or from their PC. Once uploaded, their video could be viewed by the community and voted on, giving the player community recognition.Players could also battle other players by uploading a video of their own performing the same song, and the community voted on which of the two performances they felt was the best.The community website was changing and evolving since launch with new functionality coming online on a regular basis. It no longer existsLawsuitsKonami, Autumn Games, 4mm Games, and Terminal Reality faced two lawsuits in 2012 over the release and distribution of Def Jam Rapstar.In March 2012, EMI, which controls the rights to multiple songs in the game, sued 4mm and Terminal Reality for copyright infringement on parts of songs in the game, totaling $8.1 million dollars. As many rap songs sample from other songs, EMI's lawsuit focused on the songs sampled in the game, suing, for instance over 30% of Lil' Waynes "Got Money."In May 2012, City National Bank sued Konami and Autumn games for fraud. The bank charged that the companies lied to secure $14 million in credit, claiming that the game would sell over 2.5 million copies and would raise $1 million to "pay down the loan" but never did. CNB sought the debt never paid and $9 million for fraud, breach of contract, and more.While no settlement or result of the suits can be found at this time, Rapstar's website is shut down, its DLC songs are no longer available, and the game's community features are no longer accessible.On Disc Song ListUS Song List2pac - "I Get Around"50 Cent - "I Get Money"A Tribe Called Quest - "Scenario"Beastie Boys - "Brass Monkey"Big Pun feat.
