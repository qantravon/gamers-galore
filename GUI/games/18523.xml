As in that game, the player character moves towards the screen while shooting down hordes of enemies heading towards him (and the viewer).The game utilizes a form of 3D that requires a special pair of glasses, released in Japan as the Famicom 3D System. Neither the glasses nor this game were ever released outside of Japan.Of note, this would be the last game Squaresoft made before Final Fantasy.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1532">3-D WorldRunner</game><game id="6036">Space Harrier</game><game id="2386">Rad Racer</game><game id="42829">Jinmu Denshou</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4087/566056-jj_box_front.png</image></root>
