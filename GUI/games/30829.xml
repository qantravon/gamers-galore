It consists of only one level, and only one button is used throughout the game. The gameplay consists of falling and trying to hit certain pads that start and then amplify different instruments of the song playing in the background. The left mouse button (or the A button on the keyboard) is used to rotate the player in order to get to the different pads in the level.  TAPtapTAPtapTAPtapTAP is in fact an early prototype of Dejobaan's latest game 1...2...3...KICK IT! (Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby).</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
