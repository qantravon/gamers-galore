Unlike many golf games, this was never released in Japan and remains a US exclusive.The game plays much like every other golf game for the system: Players select the club and the direction they're pointing in, stop a meter at the desired amount of power they wish to use and then repeat the process from wherever the ball may land. A minor difference is that this game accounts for the topography for the course, displaying the lay of the land from a horizontal perspective along the top of the screen. This helps the player identify where the inclines are.</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8885">NES Open Tournament Golf</game><game id="22096">Golf</game><game id="19044">Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7900/246317-bandai_golf.jpg</image></root>
