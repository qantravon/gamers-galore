The game was released with the The Last Starfighter license, but was actually just a converted version of Uridium for the Commodore 64. Some of the sprites were replaced to resemble the ships from the film, and the title screen and high scores were changed. The high scores screen lists names from the film, and the soundtrack of the game reembles the soundtrack of the film. The game itself unfortuanetly does not resemble the Last Starfighter game that is seen in the film.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="13745">R-Type</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6422/424675-19786802.jpg</image></root>
