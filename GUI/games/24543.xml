PresentationThe music is new age and relaxing.  The lack of a time limit, the soothing music, and the colorfull backgrounds set an unique mood for a puzzle game.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7115">Eets: Chowdown</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1099/815909-xboxboxart8.jpg</image></root>
