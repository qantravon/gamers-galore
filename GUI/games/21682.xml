Harold: Murder Club, sometimes as released as simply Murder Club or Final Murder Club, is a menu-driven adventure game from the creator of Hotel Dusk and Trace Memory, Rika Suzuki. It is the first in a series of murder mystery adventure games starring the titular detective.The game was initially released in Japan for the NEC PC-98 computer in 1986 and then ported to the MSX and Sharp X68000 computer systems in 1988. It was then released on the Famicom console in Japan only as Murder Club. Eventually, a 1991 PC DOS version and a Turbografx-CD version, each with improved graphics, were released in both Japan and the US. Both versions are known by the title J.B. Harold: Murder Club in the US. The game would then be released again some years later along with some of its sequels as graphically remastered DS games, though these were Japan-only releases. In more recent years, it has been ported to mobile phones and released for the iPhone internationally. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1159">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</game><game id="29533">Last Window: The Secret of Cape West</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/1763976-turbo.jpg</image></root>
