Cars are customized using a point distribution system, with modifiable attributes such as color, speed, acceleration, durability, suspension, pit crew speed and turbo. Races take place in 16 different counties, with one track in each location.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12451">Michael Andretti's World GP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361129-nes_alunserjrturboracing.jpg</image></root>
