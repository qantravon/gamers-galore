Gates' Police Quest SWAT is a full-motion video game simulating the career of a new SWAT recruit at the Los Angeles Police Department. The game was a major design shift for the Police Quest series, moving away from adventure games and into the FMV genre that was flourishing in the mid-1990s. GameplayPolice Quest: SWAT is heavily reliant on training and following strict SWAT guidelines.
