Zoids 2 also features the same developer/publisher combo of Micronics and Toshiba-EMI.As with the first NES Zoids, Zoids 2 is an RPG of the Dragon Quest variety that switches to first-person shooter battles when fighting other Zoids. The world of Zoids 2 is still every bit as incongruously medieval as the first game's world.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1528873-zoids2_front.jpg</image></root>
