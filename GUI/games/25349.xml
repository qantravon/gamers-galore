It was released in Japan on March 27, 2008 with no sign of a North American release; however, the compilation does include the English localizations for all games except Phantasy Star II Text Adventures, Phantasy Star Adventure and Phantasy Star Gaiden, since those games were never translated to English. The games also come with a sound test option and an image gallery containing concept art and instruction manual scans. Also added where applicable is the option to adjust character movement speed and battle speed as well as multiple difficulties that will increase experience and meseta rates.List of gamesPhantasy Star (Sega Mark III and Master System)Phantasy Star II (Mega Drive and Genesis)Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom (Mega Drive and Genesis)Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium (Mega Drive and Genesis)Phantasy Star II Text Adventures (Mega Drive)Phantasy Star Adventure (Game Gear) *Phantasy Star Gaiden (Game Gear) ** These games are unlocked by holding right on the D-pad and pressing start at the title screen.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24218">Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection</game><game id="14457">Sega Genesis Collection</game><game id="15050">Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana</game><game id="21442">Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm</game><game id="1959">Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny</game><game id="21541">Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica</game><game id="17621">Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia</game><game id="34771">PoPoLoCrois: Tsuki no Okite no Bouken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7667/891667-package_l.jpg</image></root>
