The object is to clear the screen by shooting colored balls at the ones currently on the play field. By matching 3 or more of the same color, the colored balls will be removed from the play field. Bust-A-Move 3 DX would later be remade for American audiences and renamed to  Bust-A-Move 99. Modes: Bust-A-Move 3 DX features five different modes of play Arcade ModeChallenge ModeWin Contest ModeCollection ModeEdit Mode</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25945">Bubble Bobble Neo!</game><game id="26622">Bust-A-Move Plus!</game><game id="29660">Trajectile</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/523312-bust_a_move_3_dx_eu_box_art.jpg</image></root>
