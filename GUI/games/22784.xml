<root><id>22784</id><name>BreakClassic</name><description>Game HistoryThe original Breakout was released in 1978. Since then, an uncountable amount of remakes have been released. This version was designed to be played on the iPhone or iPod Touch, and enjoyed it's initial release in the iTunes App store on July 30th, 2008. GameplayIf you don't know how to play the game, I suggest looking at the screen shots and thinking really hard. The goal is to clear all the bricks in a level by bouncing the ball with the paddle at the bottom of the screen. This version of the game doesn't feature any powerups, or any other modes of play at this time. Simply clear the bricks to advance to the next level.Although as with most remakes, the graphics are bright and impressive, the gameplay remains true to the original.Updates0.9.1 - released on 8/4/2008- faster- improved graphics- more levels- multiple balls- sound on/off button- pause button0.92 - released on 8/11/2008- no longer free, now it's $1.99- a free "lite edition" was released on 8/12/2008- everything from 0.9.1, but more levels as well</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12246">Pusher</game><game id="27684">Aquanoid 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6087/582057-breakclassic.jpg</image></root>
