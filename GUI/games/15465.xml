Players must return them to their cage that is located in the upper-right corner of the map. Players must also destroy the gremlins with a sword. For each Mogwai captured, bonus points are awarded. On some levels, there is food that Mogwai eat. If they eat some, they turn into gremlins. There are popcorn machines that produce food, and T.V.s that distract the gremlins. Players also get Flash Cubes, so if they need to, they can stun all Mogwai and gremlins on screen.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366075-a5200_gremlins.jpg</image></root>
