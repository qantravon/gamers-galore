The game is separated into different styles of music. There are three different styles of music within the game. There are no differences between the styles except the way the songs sound when playing them. They are:Â  Rock, Pop, and Funk.Character CustomizationWhen you first make your character, you decide her name, hair color, eye color, and skin tone. After you play a few shows and raise your popularity, you can make a quick stop by the mall and use the money you have earned to buy new clothes and instruments. The clothes are also separated into the same three styles as the ones you choose from when you create your character. The style of clothing has little to no effect on your points, pay, or popularity. The same goes for the instruments you can buy at the mall's music store.UnlockablesThere are five stages of unlockables. As you play songs you will gain popularity. After playing a fair amount of songs, you will achieve a higher popularity rank. Each time you rank up, you will unlock three new songs, a new set of clothing for each style, and a new instrument for each style. SongsThere is a total of 18 songs after you reach the highest popularity rank. None of them are licensed tracks and they are all fairly short.1 - Wonderful Morning2 - Happy Days3 - Futuristic4 - Bounce About5 - Fly High6 - Cruising7 - Cool Boy8 - My Will9 - Spin10 - Elephant House11 - Road Trip12 - On My Way13 - Here I Come14 - Bang Bang15 - Green Turtle</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20639">Guitar Hero: On Tour</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3163/265169-2501.jpg</image></root>
