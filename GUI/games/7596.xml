Gameplay involves using various colored shapes to make squares and rectangles larger than 2x2 of that same color. After the level is completed and all the blocks have dissapeared, the painting is then revealed. Underpants are usually a common theme in all the paintings.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26918">Puzzlegeddon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1212/637733-itsmrpantsboxart.jpg</image></root>
