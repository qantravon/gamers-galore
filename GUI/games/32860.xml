An arcade machine was never sold that was orignally dedicated to playing Shuuz. For this reason it is an obscure arcade release, even though very few games focused on horse shoes. The game follows the fictional professionals of the sport in a very cartoonish manner. The game has numerous sight gags and humorous one liners.GameplayThe excitement of professional horse shoesThe game play is very basic, and is controlled using a track ball. You select one of few characters, and are play on a very rural horse shoe course. You are simply tasked with throwing the horse shoe and, getting a ringer or land in the proximity of the pole on the course. To throw the horse shoe you simply pull back in the track ball, and push the ball to release. Depending on the power you use on the track ball the horse shoe would travel different distances. There is also a multiplayer mode of up to 4 players, where the oppenents take turns throwing.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/68180/1549323-1181242168239.png</image></root>
