Vox will have a big focus on player created content, and will allow the player to customize every aspect of the game.Players can create their own custom characters, weapons, items, monsters, NPCs and everything else in the game. Since everything in the game is made up of voxels, everything can be edited and customized using the same interface. The editors and tools that allow for creation of voxel objects and sprites are part of the game and built into the gameplay of the game. This allows Vox to go one step further than other voxel based games, that only allow modification to the voxel world.Vox also features a dynamic world that is populated with many interactive elements, such as monsters and NPC villages and will have a fully driven story and adventure mode. this mode will also feature a dynamic quest system that will give the player greater focus and drive to do more in the game than just 'create stuff'.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30475">Minecraft</game><game id="26427">Infiniminer</game><game id="37154">Castle Story</game><game id="34940">Terraria</game><game id="38059">Yogventures!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155635/2299780-2299779-screenshot67.png</image></root>
