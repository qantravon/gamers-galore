<root><id>10499</id><name>Belief &amp; Betrayal</name><description>Overview  -A quick-paced thriller/adventure with the opportunity to play as three different characters. Third person perspective, point-and-click interface. Mostly inventory puzzles, plus combinations using an “ideas” list. No timed puzzles, no mazes, no sliders, no sound matching puzzles, no color based puzzles. Working with the inventory is frustratingly slow, and moving the characters around can be confusing and inconsistent.  -Elegant environments, including some famous sites in , and . A sometimes hard-to-follow, complex plot that (along with a few religious and legend-based clichés) features plot twists and a surprise ending. An aura of mystery and conspiracy, combined with an absurdist sense of humor.  -Brief, but dramatic cut scenes, good voiceovers, splendid background music. You can’t die. A spacebar glitch that stops progress and requires reloading from a previous save.  -Two somewhat difficult puzzles: the clock puzzle, putting together clues gathered at different points in the game, and the “Fire in the Borgo” puzzle, involving details and implications.  -No problems with installation. The manual is a must read. Unlimited save slots.  Belief  Betrayal is aimed at gamers who like investigating historical mysteries, uncovering conspiracies, and digging beneath the surface of some of ’s most glamorous cityscapes.   System RequirementsOS: Windows 2000/ XP/Vista  CPU: 1 GHz Intel Pentium processor or AMD Athlon processor  RAM: 512 MB (1 GB recommended for Windows Vista  Video: 64 MB DirectX 9.0c compatible or better video card  CD-ROM: 4x (or DVD-ROM drive)  Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card  2 GB of hard disk space</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2593/399103-8075.jpg</image></root>
