It is known by the name Seishun Scandal in Japan and first saw release for the arcades in 1985, with a Master System home console version arriving the following year.Both versions allow for two players, however players must alternate turns and there are no opportunities for co-op play. The game is often regarded as a crude early entry into the 2D brawler genre and was a modest commercial success upon release. My Hero also enjoys the novelty of being available on the secondary Sega Card format for the Master System. Story and GameplayA brief opening scene shows our bowtied Hero and his girlfriend assaulted by oncoming bandits, resulting in a kidnapping for the girl and ample side scrolling action motivation for the boy.Gameplay consists of the player utilizing crouching and jumping kicks, along with a forward punch, to move the protagonist onward past enemies and obstacles. Henchmen will approach from both the left and right sides of the screen, often brandishing weapons. Individual stages scroll between cityscapes that feature greater numbers of enemies, including bottles from windows, to platform heavy segments with less enemies but other obstacles including flinging bombs, charging pigs and fire pits.At the end of each stage a boss battle occurs against your assailant under a sunset backdrop, 10 hit points apiece. After defeat the deviant will take your girlfriend once again and the next stage begins. New stages introduce new foes, and there are three stages in total.
