In the game players must play as a virtual Macaulay Culkin, who must make his way through three worlds each consisting several levels and each based on a different literary genre. (Horror, Adventure and Fantasy.) Along with several collectables completists can look to collect a library card in each level. For a kids game the game was fairly challenging due in part to your character loosing a life if he's hit unless you collect an item in which case he looses that. The PC version of the game is completely different; it is an point and click adventure game that has a plot unrelated to that of the movie.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20438">Wild Woody</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/768835-pagemaster_front.jpg</image></root>
