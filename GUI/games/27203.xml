In it, you play as Dr. Peter Venkman, who gets trapped in a dungeon and has to advance in all 51 levels in order to escape. Venkman's only weapon at hand is his Proton Pack which he unfortunately cannot use it to blast ghosts away but on blocks at the character's feet to make holes for trapping ghosts and creating new passages. Another means of damaging ghosts is by using cherry bombs.While the levels all differ from one to another, they all share the same objective; collect a number of stars and exit the door before time runs out.The game utilized different licenses in different regions. In Europe it was a Garfield game titled Garfield Labyrinth and in Japan it was a Mickey Mouse game titled Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labryinth (The Magical Labyrinth).Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 6 out of 10 writing, "...run around and grab items while dodging ghosts... this game is a good time filler, just don't expect too much".</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26507/1069419-the_real_ghostbusters.jpg</image></root>
