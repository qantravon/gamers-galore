The player finds himself at the steps of that very dark tower, where Iris is being held prisoner. Through various stages, the player must solve puzzles, jump into paintings drawn by Iris and help the inhabitants of which. The game involves some hidden object searching, but most of it is puzzle solving. The game comes with a robust hint system and all puzzles can be skipped, making the game much more casual than the actual difficulty of the puzzles might suggest.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14852">Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst</game><game id="21061">Mystery Case Files: MillionHeir</game><game id="32558">Drawn: Dark Flight</game><game id="34452">Awakening: The Dreamless Castle</game><game id="29127">Mystery Case Files: Madame Fate</game><game id="35481">Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident</game><game id="12637">Mystery Case Files: Huntsville</game><game id="33550">Hidden Mysteries: Salem Secrets</game><game id="30360">Hidden Mysteries: Buckingham Palace Secrets of Kings &amp; Queens</game><game id="28230">Hidden Mysteries Titanic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/27/1121678-picture_1.png</image></root>
