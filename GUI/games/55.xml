<root><id>55</id><name>Robo Rumble</name><description>Robo Rumble was a simple Real Time Strategy game, with a key selling point for its release year of 1998: a 3D environment. The game was released on Windows PCs only, and is a straightforward affair. Players are challenged to beat enemies, and the game is condensed down to one resource: money. You may spend money on new units, and should enemies destroy the unit, you are refunded the value of that unit. The game includes a simplistic chat interface which is available between missions, which allows players to purchase new units and unit upgrades. The game was originally released in  Poland under the name of 'Reflux'. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10484/1409911-1555.2.jpg</image></root>
