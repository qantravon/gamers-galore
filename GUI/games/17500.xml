<root><id>17500</id><name>King of Dragon Pass</name><description>In King of Dragon Pass, the player is the chief of a human tribe in a magical world. The game is turn-based and in each turn, there are decisions to be made that will affect the tribe to some degree. Some of which are related to warfare and others send some of your tribesmen on quests, all the while taking care of other, more domestic matters such as available food. The tribe is ruled through seven tribe elders who each have their own abilities and deities they believe in and they can also die and be replaced with younger tribesmen.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="976">The Lost Tribe</game><game id="13761">Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye</game><game id="8258">Lords of the Realm II</game><game id="10935">Darklands</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23967/947636-king_of_dragon_pass_for_mac_113839_1.jpeg</image></root>
