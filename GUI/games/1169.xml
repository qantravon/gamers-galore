The goal is to collect passengers' luggage so that they can be put on the conveyer belt. Each time a plane lands, the suitcases start flying, and players must collect them before they burst open and the clothes begin to scatter. Players move the characters up and down and from side to side in an attempt to collect as much as they can. Miss too many items and the game is over.One of the notable aspects of the game is some of the risque (at the time) articles that would escape from the luggage, including a woman's undergarments.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9094">Kaboom!</game><game id="11867">Katamari Damacy</game><game id="11678">Beautiful Katamari</game><game id="18373">We Love Katamari</game><game id="6924">Me &amp; My Katamari</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5278/427063-lost_luggage.jpg</image></root>
