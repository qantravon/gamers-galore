The announcer for the game is Marv Albert, and there are over 2,000 lines in the game such as "Boom-Shakalaka," "Razzle-Dazzle," and "He's on fire!" There is an extreme button featured in this game which acts as a turbo button. There are 60 hidden characters, special teams (such as a superstar '90s team), 30 dances and dunks, and easter eggs such as "big-head" mode. Some of the modes of the game include exhibition, round-robin, one-on-one, and two-on-two. In round-robin you compete in games until you lose a game. Some players that were not able to make it into the game because of contractual obligations were Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="125">College Slam</game><game id="61">NBA Street V3</game><game id="7982">NBA Street</game><game id="18984">NBA Courtside 2: Featuring Kobe Bryant</game><game id="20819">NBA Live 09</game><game id="9866">NBA Street Vol. 2</game><game id="4632">NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1536643-nbajamex_box.png</image></root>
