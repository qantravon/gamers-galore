<root><id>6724</id><name>1602 A.D.</name><description>Set in the Colonial Age, the player is responsible for the well-being of a group of settlers who set out to settle the New World.The game is set in the Early Modern period of history and revolves around colony building and resource management on a series of small islands. It includes aspects of exploration, combat, diplomacy and trade. It is set in the same period as Sid Meier's Colonization, but involves more detailed colony management, excluding any "Old World" political issues. Parts of the game, such as expansion and transportation of resources are similar to the early Settlers games. Anno 1602 is an economical, rather than combat orientated strategy game. Players are rarely challenged in battle. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' AI, meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly the player acts. The game has been expanded by Anno 1602 - New Islands, New Adventures and Anno 1602 - By Royal Command, both released in 1998.The sequels of the game are Anno 1503, Anno 1701 and Anno 1404.PC System RequirementsMinimumCPU Type: PentiumCPU Speed in MHz: 100 MHzRAM: 16MBHard Drive Space: 120MBSound Card: SoundBlaster or 100% compatibleCD Drive Speed: 4XVideo Card: PCIVideo RAM in MB: 2MBGraphics Type: SVGAColor Depth: 16-bitGraphics Resolution(s): 640x480, 800x600Multiplayer: Modem Speed: 28.8 Kbps</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="26867">East India Company</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="20779">Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization</game><game id="8876">Sid Meier's Colonization</game><game id="19390">Conquest of the New World</game><game id="25818">Dawn of Discovery</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="2353">Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="3954">Europa 1400: The Guild</game><game id="17645">The Guild 2</game><game id="6261">The Guild 2: Pirates of the European Seas</game><game id="24705">The Guild 2 Venice</game><game id="37889">The Guild 2: Renaissance</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/827671-anno_1602___creation_of_a_new_world_coverart.png</image></root>
