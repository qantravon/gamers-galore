<root><id>31131</id><name>Jack The Ripper</name><description>"This is a seek-and-find adventure game in which players assume the role of an investigator attempting to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper. Players search for clues among scenes of jumbled objects, interview suspects, and read a narrative that details the timeline of five murder cases. On-screen text and dialogue detail the murders; for example, "She had suffered a series of horrific wounds and the killer had removed several of her organs with surgical precision," "Mary Kelly’s body was found . . . dismembered and mutilated beyond recognition," and "The next job I do I shall clip the lady’s ears off and send . . ." Some clues, such as a straight razor and a handkerchief, are stained with blood. A letter in the game describes victims as "wh*res," and a character biography references a man’s contraction of syphilis." </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1073/1358082-weird_1_2_3_4_5_6.jpg</image></root>
