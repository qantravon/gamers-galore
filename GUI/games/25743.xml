It was developed using an updated version of the  Championship Surfer engine. Critics complained that in updating the engine developers did not update the graphics enough, leaving the game looking dated from its launch.  Other aspects which received negative attention include a limited  trick system and poor  camera angles. Features A library of over 50 tricksUnlockable  surfboardsUnlockable  surf spotsMultiple gameplay modes Alternative rock soundtrackGameplay ModesChampionshipArcadeRumble (multiplayer)King of the Wave  (multiplayer)Time AttackChallengeFree Surf</description><genres><genre id="47">Surfing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9279">Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer</game><game id="2751">TransWorld SURF</game><game id="25647">Transworld Surf: Next Wave</game><game id="5688">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</game><game id="14896">Tony  Hawk's Underground</game><game id="1492">Tony Hawk's Underground 2</game><game id="18231">Tony Hawk's Underground 2: Remix</game><game id="7222">Tony Hawk's American Wasteland</game><game id="20695">Tony Hawk's Proving Ground</game><game id="12077">Tony Hawk's Project 8</game><game id="2101">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</game><game id="9243">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX</game><game id="22469">Dave Mirra BMX Challenge</game><game id="6737">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX: Maximum Remix</game><game id="3238">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3</game><game id="20954">Shaun White Snowboarding</game><game id="25097">Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder</game><game id="16373">Wakeboarding Unleashed featuring Shaun Murray</game><game id="27100">iSurf</game><game id="6330">Championship Surfer</game><game id="16364">Surfing H3O</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2276073-box_sgs.png</image></root>
