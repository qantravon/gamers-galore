Similar to games like    Sunset Riders, Mystic Warriors is primarily a side scrolling shooter for you and up to two friends. Your primary attack involves throwing shurikens. By collecting power-ups, you can upgrade your shuriken attack strength three times, eventually earning you a spread shot and rapid auto-fire.     "My Rocket is the best! ...NOT!"     At the end of each stage you face off against a boss character, usually introduced by a nonsensical   engrish voice clip. There are five total playable characters to choose from, and after selecting who you want to play as, the game will choose at random which of the unpicked characters will be kidnapped by the game's villain. The rest of the game is spent trying to rescue the missing hero.  Story    They'll let anybody be a ninja these days         The evil SKULL ENTERPRISE is conquering the world with its army of evil ninjas.
