<root><id>2551</id><name>D-Force</name><description>OverviewD-Force, or Dimension Force, is a Super Nintendo vertical shoot 'em up in which the player controls a blue and red Apache helicopter. Each stage alternates between "Shooting Mode", which plays like a traditional shoot 'em up with realistic enemies and "Exploration Mode", which allows the player to change their altitude and fight unusual enemies like dinosaurs.Like the later Axelay, D-Force takes full advantage of the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 by emphasizing its sprite scaling technology. Before starting each stage, the player takes off from a zoomed-in version of the background (similar to Pilotwings) and, upon losing all their lives, spirals towards the incoming ground in the same effect. The Exploration Mode stages allows the player to drop their height, which also zooms in on the background.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10466">1942</game><game id="20755">19XX: The War Against Destiny</game><game id="16253">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</game><game id="5084">S.W.I.V.</game><game id="11930">Twin Cobra</game><game id="18152">Choplifter!</game><game id="12192">Axelay</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363714-snes_dforce.jpg</image></root>
