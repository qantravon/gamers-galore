<root><id>19170</id><name>Caesar IV</name><description>OverviewCaesar 4 is the fourth game in the long running city management series from Sierra. It was originally released on September 26th 2006. The game was received reasonably well, with a 74 Metacritic score.Â  This was the first in the series to feature full 3D graphics, mainly because it had been 8 years since the previous game. While the game may have been updated considerable graphics wise, it is almost entirely identical gameplay wise. Even down to the near identical HUD. The game is divided into three parts named after the three traditional eras of Ancient Rome: Kingdom, Republic and Empire. Kingdom serves as a Tutorial for the game, whereas Republic and Empire your given pretty much free reign.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="3403">Railroad Pioneer</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="22080">SimCity Societies: Destinations</game><game id="21729">Cities XL</game><game id="6724">1602 A.D.</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="26943">Children of the Nile: Alexandria</game><game id="31174">Anno 1404: Venice</game><game id="18584">StarPeace</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/18366/610169-caesar4.jpg</image></root>
