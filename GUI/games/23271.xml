Periodically you have to stop and buy gas or other items. The seven lucky Gods make an appearance as opposites to the 7 masters.GAMEPLAYThe player controls a ship armed with a blaster and a large mallet; they must navigate through "space", an environment vaguely resembling a disco floor, while avoiding various other space ships (or preferably destroying them to earn money!). Destroying enemies with the mallet is risky but nets a money bonus. In addition, the player's gas (life) ticks down constantly. It is also reduced by damage from enemies. To counter-act this slow grind to death, the player must buy more gas. This results in cyclic game play; destroy more enemies to buy more gas. In addition, the color-changing floor has various effects on the ship: On green tiles, gas consumption is at the normal rate, on yellow tiles it is slightly increased. Red tiles rapidly deplete gas and violently shift the spaceship; this can result in difficult situations where the ship is forcibly moved from one red tile to another repeatedly. Blue tiles, only revealed by the pickup of a smiley face, very slightly increase the player's gas, but at such a slow rate it is almost unnoticeable.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/44493/1647032-captainedfront.jpg</image></root>
