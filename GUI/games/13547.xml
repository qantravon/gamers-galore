The player controls Dr. Jones in his encounters with Nazis, natives and local bandits. These enemies must be killed, or bypassed, in order to progress past a variety of puzzles. Most of these puzzles consist of picking up an object to give to a person.  Eventually the player will have to defeat a randomly generated boss and be awarded with a 'player IQ'. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13349">Star Wars: Yoda Stories</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6357/198982-indianajonesandhisdesktopadventures.png</image></root>
