<root><id>25869</id><name>Cogs</name><description>OverviewDeveloped by Lazy 8 Studios, Cogs is a puzzle game where all the given pieces in the set board, or contraption must be connected in order to have the machine work properly. The puzzle pieces are, but limited to, cog pieces, pipes, and bells, or sometimes combination of two or three. The puzzle boards are not limited in 2D view, they can be turned around to see the backside, and sometimes that is also part of puzzle. There are three types of rewards for completing puzzles. One is for solving the puzzle, another one for solving the puzzle fast as possible and another one for solving the puzzle with least number of moves. There are 50 puzzles in the game, and the harder ones are unlocked by having certain numbers of rewards.System RequirementsPCOS: Microsoft Windows XP or VistaProcessor: 1.5 GHz CPU or betterMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: DirectX 9 compatible 64 MB graphics card with hardware transform and lighting (TL)DirectXÂ®: DirectX 9.0c or laterHard Drive: 120 MB Free SpaceSound: DirectX compatible sound cardMacOS: OS X version Snow Leopard 10.5.8, or later.Processor: Intel-based processorMemory: 1 GB RAMHard Disk Space: 320 MBVideo Card: hardware support for OpenGL 2.0 or higher (Does not work with Intel GMA 950 or lower graphics processors)</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29167">Geared</game><game id="40156">BioShock Infinite: Industrial Revolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2168560-1290248318_00.jpg</image></root>
