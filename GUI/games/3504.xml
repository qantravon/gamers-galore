Battling your way to defeat a turncoat scientist creating an army of mutants, Dynamite Duke was a over-the-shoulder rail shooter. Armed with a MAC-10 and cybernetic arm, Duke shot and punched his way through the game's levels, as it offered both shooting and hand-to-hand action.An updated version of Dynamite Duke with simultaneous multiplayer was released to arcades under the name "The Double Dynamites."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="14088">Operation Thunderbolt</game><game id="15547">Mechanized Attack</game><game id="1201">Wild Guns</game><game id="11134">Cabal</game><game id="8187">The Super Spy</game><game id="18841">Crossed Swords</game><game id="12758">Dead Angle</game><game id="19895">Empire City: 1931</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14034/442000-dynamite_duke.jpg</image></root>
