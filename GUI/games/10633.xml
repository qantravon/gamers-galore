The Cobra series' most immediately obvious trait is how it tends to feature many scantily-clad women, who either intend to seduce Cobra or kill him. Or both.Despite some state-of-the-art sound and voice clips, the game is much like every other menu-based adventure game around for the NES and home systems of the day. The player must figure out the correct course to solve puzzles and progress with the story, using various commands they choose from a side menu while in the world. They can talk to other characters, interact with their surroundings and find and use items to help them proceed. The goal of this game in particular is to hunt down an alien artifact that Cobra wants to steal, except all the while he is being followed by a shadowy figure.The game would be followed by a sequel - Cobra II: Densetsu no Otoko. The Sega CD version of which was released in the US and Europe as The Space Adventure. It received a Mature rating for its many half-naked female characters.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12552">Snatcher</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2382487-space_adventure_cobra_pcecd.jpg</image></root>
