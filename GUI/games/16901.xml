Dense ambient traffic now surrounds the player for the first time in the series, allowing the player to experience the true fun - and difficulties, of driving a colossal 18-wheeler. Make a million dollars as fast as possible, buy new trucks, hire new drivers and haul more cargo to grow your company. This was also the first game in the franchise to feature real-life cities, spread across 3 different maps.
