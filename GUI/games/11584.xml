While using the pad users mimic walking on the pad like in Track and Field. As they do this a red circle with a smile, that signifies the player, goes around a virtual track with each step moving the circle more. Depending on the mode that is played there may be green circles to indicate "pace guides. If the player crosses these pace guides while they are red they will lose a life, but if they cross the guides while they are green then they will be awarded bonus points. When the player gains 2,000 points the pace dots speed up and a second dot will be added to the track when the player exceeds five minutes of play time. </description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="44">Fitness</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
