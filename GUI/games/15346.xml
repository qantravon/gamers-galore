It is the player's responsibility to make sure they survive in the space colony. To do so, they will have to fulfill their basic needs, accomplish missions, and fulfill their duties so that the Space Colony may grow bigger and mightier. The challenge of the game resides in keeping the protagonists happy and healthy, in order for them to execute important tasks such as building defenses to protect the colony from alien attacks. In time more people will join your colony, as it grows bigger. In the story mode you change planets and try to gather resources and sometimes exterminate alien species.CharactersVenus JonesNationality: United StatesStig SvenssonNationality: Norway (though he has a Swedish accent)Tami La BelleNationality: Texas (United States)Dean Jefferson BrownNationality: Los Angeles (United States)Candy SimpsonNationality: California (United States)'Nailer' McBrideNationality: ScottishBarbra LeechwortheNationality: Unkown.System RequirementsPC System Requirements:Windows 98/ME/2000/XP800MHz Processor64MB RAM850MB Hard Disk Space4MB DirectX Compatible Video CardDirectX Compatible Sound Card8X CD-ROMDirectX 8.1Mac System Requirements:700MHz G3Mac OS X v10.2.8256MB RAM1GB hard disk space4X CD-ROM</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17463">The Sims</game><game id="2473">The Sims 2</game><game id="23431">Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals</game><game id="14139">Spore</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16324/1057794-space_colony.jpg</image></root>
