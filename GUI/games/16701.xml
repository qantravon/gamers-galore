Â While the game allowed shots to be taken from a traditional viewpoint behind the player, the primary view of the game was top-down and all movement of the ball was seen from this position. Multiplayer was available for up to 4 players, which required multiple copies of the game and use of the ComLynx cable.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6799">PGA Tour Golf</game><game id="1336">Cyber Tiger</game><game id="2573">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001</game><game id="14247">PGA Tour Golf III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6763/387765-c_bluelightning_ridged_front.jpg</image></root>
