<root><id>9364</id><name>Top Gear</name><description>Top Gear, is a racing game, launched for the SNES in 1992. It was published by Kemco, and was developed by Gremlin Graphics. It was one of the first racing games launched for the console. The main goal of the game, is to dominate the world of motor racing, by winning races from several different countries and against many computer rivals.GameplayIn Top Gear, the player navigates each track using the d-pad and acceleration button. You must race against 20 other CPU cars. There are a number of obstacles like rocks, traffic blockers, or other cars that must be avoided. Besides accelerating and taking turns the game contains a nitro system allowing the player to have 3 speed boosts. During these speed boosts it is possible to travel well over 200 MPH driving downhill and it is easier to turn. The game also allows you to pull over into the pit-stop to refuel. This costs valuable time but is necessary to continue racing. The pit-stop system adds a layer of strategy because the player must decide when to pull over during the race because it can be hard to catch up again and return to first place.1 Player ModeEven in 1 Player mode the screen is split in two by a vertical line. The player controls the car on the upper half of the screen, and on the bottom half a CPU car is shown. The CPU on the bottom screen is the best competitor and will almost always come in first or (if the player places first) second place. Depending on how the player places in each race they are awarded with a certain amount of points. These points determine an overall ranking. At the end of the 4 races for each country if the player is ranked 3 or higher then they get the password for the next country and can continue.2 Player ModeWhen two players are playing the screen is still split the same way and the second player controls the car on the bottom half. If one player is ranked 3 or higher they both get to continue on to the next country.CarsThere are four different cars available, with varying amounts of tire grip, fuel consumption, acceleration, and top speeds. The white car is generally thought to be the best choice for beginners.Red CarMax Speed: 235 KPH0-100: 6.1 secTire Grip: LowFuel Consumption: HighWhite CarMax Speed: 210 KPH0-100: 3.6 secTire Grip: HighFuel Consumption: LowPurple CarMax Speed: 220 KPH0-100: 5.2 secTire Grip: LowFuel Consumption: HighBlue CarMax Speed: 220 KPH0-100: 4.5 secTire Grip: MidFuel Consumption: MidCountriesThere are 8 different countries that are featured in the game.
