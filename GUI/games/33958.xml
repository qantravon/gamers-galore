Minami no Island!!.GameplayThe goal is to move along a board of 28-31 spaces that represent a month, finding helpful items and either gaining or losing money depending on what is found after each roll. The first player to pass the finish line gets a 100 yen bonus, but players that keep rolling low numbers might find themselves with more money in the long run if they're particularly fortunate. Games can be set from 1 month up to an entire 12 months, with the eventual winner decided by the total amount of money earned.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1688275-chibi_maruko_chan_harikiri_365_nichi_no_maki_box_front.jpg</image></root>
