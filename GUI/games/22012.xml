In an unthinkable move, GDI  Nod team up to prevent CABAL from taking over the world through 18 single player missions. On top of all that, the world has never looked so grim before. Tiberium and it's many mutations have covered the whole planet at this point except for the few areas GDI protects. Terrible Ion Storm rage wherever Tiberium can be found, combined with the toxic nature of Tiberium to humans it is estimated hundreds of millions have died from the transformed Planet. However some Humans  Animals such as Dogs whohave been effected by Tiberium for a long time and rather then dieing they became Mutants, abominations infused with Tiberium that are not accepted by those not affected. If CABAL has his way, every Human will become a Cyborg obeying only him. Who will you fight for, man or machine?</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14805">KKND2: Krossfire</game><game id="1552">Dune 2000</game><game id="13125">Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction</game><game id="33907">APOX</game><game id="15235">Dark Reign: The Future of War</game><game id="16156">Dark Reign 2</game><game id="40429">Echelon: Explore, Discover and Eliminate</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5128/274252-firestorm.jpg</image></root>
