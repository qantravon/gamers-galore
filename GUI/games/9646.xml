In order to move on there are some levels you have to complete before you can go further in the game, but you can always return to a level that you have completed before. Like any older platformer you have a timer on each level, complete it with in the time limit and you will get a bonus, going over the time will not earn you anything, and you will not be able to gain access to one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17009/822508-brian_the_lion02.jpg</image></root>
