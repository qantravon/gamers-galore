<root><id>38803</id><name>SimCity Social</name><description>OverviewSimCity Social is a browser game available on Facebook. The open beta was released on June 25, 2012 from Maxis and EA Games. Like the other SimCity games, players can build up their own city and fulfill the needs of their citizens to earn simoleons (the basic unit of currency in the game). Players can also earn experience points, gather materials, and interact with other cities made by Facebook friends. Interacting with other cities rewards players with Fame points. Similar to many other Facebook games, most actions consume energy points (which are limited and must build up over time or are earned as rewards).</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31048">FarmVille</game><game id="34929">CityVille</game><game id="21729">Cities XL</game><game id="32401">Cities In Motion</game><game id="31314">MyTown</game><game id="40558">YoVille</game><game id="42201">The Oregon Trail: American Settler</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/161375/2246661-simcitysociallogo.jpg</image></root>
