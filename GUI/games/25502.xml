Players take it in turn to spin the wheel and guess the Hangman-esque puzzles by revealing letters until the answer becomes clear.The game was released on both the Genesis and Super Nintendo, with almost zero difference between the two versions. It would be followed up (on the SNES only) with Wheel of Fortune: Deluxe Edition, which uses slightly updated graphics.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26419">Family Feud</game><game id="38313">Cult Jump</game><game id="32997">Wheel of Fortune</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364697-snes_wheeloffortune.jpg</image></root>
