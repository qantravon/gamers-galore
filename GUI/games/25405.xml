The website also says: "We don't try to explain the world... it just is." They say the game will feature a dark fantasy setting and will have a very powerful main character. The character will apparently use a mixture of stealth and magical abilities to complete tasks in the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12572">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</game><game id="19467">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
