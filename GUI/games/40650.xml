<root><id>40650</id><name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Double Damage</name><description>The game was initially playable on a domain owned by Ubisoft, but after they lost the license to TMNT games, it was placed on Nickelodeon's website (it is no longer available on the latter, either). However, it has been archived on large Flash communities such as Kongregate and Newgrounds.The Turtles' designs are sort of a mix of their 1987 cartoon incarnations, and their 2007 film versions. The other characters are designed after their 2003 cartoon counterparts.Players may choose from one of the four Turtles to play with, then choose either one of the three remaining Turtles as a partner, or Casey, Splinter, or a Pizza Delivery Boy.Like the old arcade games, Foot Ninja wear different colored uniforms depending on their functions. Bosses include Hun, the Utrom Shredder Ch'rell, and the Tengu Shredder Oroku Saki.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28026">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack</game><game id="39261">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Dark Horizons</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2376322-tmnt_double_damage.jpg</image></root>
