It is a direct sequel to the original          Art of Fighting, with only minor changes in gameplay. Story mode can now be played with any playable character and characters are more balanced in Versus matches. The difficulty of the A.I. is increased significantly in this game. The story takes place in South Town a year after the events of the original Art of Fighting. Unlike the previous game, which had a linear story that can only be played by the two main characters, this game is non-linear and is not limited to the main characters. Each character has their own story, from generally beating other fighters up to revenge. However, they are being watched by agents of an uprising crime boss.Gameplay Art of Fighting 2 plays similarly to the original Art of Fighting. You have a punch and kick button, which gives either weak or strong punches depending on your distance from the opponent. The third button is the "utility" button, which either gives you an uppercut punch or low kick (when combined with the punch and kick buttons), a throw, or a walljump. The fourth button is the taunting button. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards  by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireball attacks can be canceled using punches and kicks. The game also includes the "spirit gauge" from the original Art of Fighting.. The gauge  lowers after the player performs a special/super move. The more powerful  the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when  your opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually  by holding down either the punch, kick, or utility button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left. Unlike the prequel, every character is given a Super and "Desperation" move. Both super and desperation moves take up much of the rage gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when  the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar). In single player, these moves can only be learned through a special bonus stage.  Each character is given more variety of moves, unlike the previous game where everybody except Ryo and Robert had limited variety of moves.Characters                          Ryo Sakazaki                        Robert Garcia                       Yuri Sakazaki                      Takuma Sakazaki                    King                     Eiji Kisaragi                   Lee Pai Long  Jack Turner                  Mickey Rogers                 John Crawley Temjin                Mr. Big                          Geese Howard (secret boss, not playable in the Arcade version)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8680">Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX</game><game id="3185">ClayFighter 63 1/3</game><game id="243">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</game><game id="8045">Karnov's Revenge</game><game id="1752">Double Dragon</game><game id="19626">World Heroes 2</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="16793">Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="22362">Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting</game><game id="21519">The King of Fighters XII</game><game id="16200">The King of Fighters: Neowave</game><game id="5964">The King of Fighters '99</game><game id="22629">Rage of the Dragons</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/852611-562710_28793_front.jpg</image></root>
