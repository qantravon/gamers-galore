It features and is named for Japanese TV personality La Salle Ishii and focuses on a beleagured manager (the protagonist, named by the player) and his three-member up-and-coming J-Pop band "Childs". In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must "fight" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.The game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/2094862-1.jpg</image></root>
