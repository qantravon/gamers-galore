Also, path splits are implemented, allowing you to choose what path your team will take based on your actions on the battlefield.Units: In the original Super Robot Wars 2, many units would join your force, yet leave only a few missions later. 2G changes that, as you are allowed to keep just about every character that you obtain. Also, characters   Tetsuya Tsurugi and  Ryuune Zoldark are playable, unlike the original game.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23080">Super Robot Wars 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/541873-srw2g.jpg</image></root>
