It follows an amnesiac young man named X114JAM9 as he searches across the Post-Cyberpocalyptic Wasteland to find the Cyberdwarf and shut down the tyrannical A.I. Cuchulainn.GameplayUnlike Barkley Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden, which was a turn-based RPG, Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa is a mouse controlled action RPG with weapon fusion elements, said to take inspiration from the Shin Megami Tensei series. Additionally, while "Barkley Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden" was a freeware game making liberal use of assets from other games, celebrity likenesses, and copyrighted characters, Tales of Game's Studios has explained that because Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa will be an online retail product, it will feature all original assets and limited-to-no use of celebrity likenesses to avoid legal complications.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16836">Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne</game><game id="25312">Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4231/2367642-barkley2_cyberdwarfconfrontation_fdpln.jpg</image></root>
