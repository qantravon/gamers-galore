The game was published by Hot-B in 1990. The player must build up their forces, form alliances, and do battle with other warlords of the era.In an unusual move, the label on the NES cartridge features an index detailing what each of the abbreviations in the in-game menus stand for. The decision to place such information directly on the cartridge itself is noteworthy due to the fact that when the game was published in North America, the top-loading variant of the NES had yet to exist. At the time, there was no way to read the label while playing the game.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14028">Nobunaga's Ambition</game><game id="4490">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</game><game id="39959">Takeda Shingen</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362194-nes_shingentheruler_2.jpg</image></root>
