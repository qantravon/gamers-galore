<root><id>15374</id><name>Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat</name><description>Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat is a 3-player racing game which made its debut on the arcade before its release for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. The game bears a similar visual style and gameplay mechanics when compared to the more popular Super Off Road, as both games were developed by the same developer. The game features 5 cars racing simultaneously on a circuit composed of 15 races (on 14 different tracks) with racing elements such as crashes, pit stops, and fuel loss in the mix. Upgrades can be performed on a car after each race, with the amount of upgrades allowed depending on where the driver finished for that race.TracksPhoenixLaps: 8  VancouverLaps: 5  IndianapolisLaps: 8  Long BeachLaps: 5  DetroitLaps: 5  PoconoLaps: 8  ClevelandLaps: 5  MeadowlandsLaps: 5  TorontoLaps: 5  MichiganLaps: 8  LexingtonLaps: 5  Elkhart LakeLaps: 5  MontereyLaps: 5  DenverLaps: 5  IndianapolisLaps: 12 </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20608">PixelJunk Racers</game><game id="9509">Ivan "Iron Man" Stewart's Super Off Road</game><game id="2776">Super Sprint</game><game id="12451">Michael Andretti's World GP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361635-nes_dannysullivansindyheat.jpg</image></root>
