Rather, the player can pause the game and set the position of objects and place movement tiles that direct which way a team member will go once the game is unpaused.  Meet the Team The Alpha Team consists of seven members:  Dash, the team leader and motion expert.  Crunch ,  explosives expert.   Cam ,  mechanic and motor expert.Radia ,  laser expert.Charge , true to his name, the  electricity expert.  Flex, the  rope expert.  TeeVee, the team's helpful  robot sidekick.  Go Team Alpha! The Alpha Team's main objective is to stop the evil and mysterious Ogel in his quest of  world domination. Ogel uses  mind control orbs to turn innocent people into his skeleton  minions, which are the primary enemy of the game. The team is equipped with special belts that allow them to destroy the orbs by passing through them, which neutralizes the minions it controls.    The game begins with only access to Dash and basic objects such as stairs and jump pads. As the player progresses and frees captured Alpha Team members, they  gain further access to that member and their objects of expertise, such as explosive charges and detonators with Crunch, for example. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21268">The Hobbit</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3186/399147-legoalphateamgameboyclour.jpg</image></root>
