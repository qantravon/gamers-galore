This is not present is the Genesis version.In the Game Gear version, almost every character has a dive kick move executed by hitting the punch and kick buttons simultaneously while in the air. This is not present is the Genesis version.In the Game Gear Version, all special moves are executed with a Hadouken motion (Down, Down Toward, Toward), while the Genesis version also uses charge moves.In the story mode for the Game Gear version, the player fights a gambit of putty patrols followed by a brief battle with Goldar; Goldar disappears before his life bar can be fully drained. The level boss then appears. This format continues throughout the game. In the Genesis version, there are no enemies present before the stage boss.CharactersRed RangerBlue RangerYellow RangerMegazordDragonzord F.
