In each stage of the race, the player must mash the B button, similar to Track  Field, in order to reach the end of each course before their opponents. After winning a triathlon, the player can invest some points into their chosen competitor's stats and move onto the next.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="42">Track &amp; Field</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18232">Track &amp; Field</game><game id="26643">Cycle Race: Road Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2367368-the_triathron_fc.jpg</image></root>
