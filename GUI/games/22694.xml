Using the WASD keys players can open up menus that allow them to construct factories, power generators, and ship yards. Players must defend their command post and at the same time destroy their opponents. AI controlled ships can aid the player, but the player can give them some orders and break them up into various squads. All ships must be made within the range of the base or a battery that has been constructed.
