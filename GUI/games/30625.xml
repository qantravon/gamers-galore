Despite the presence of a grid-based area map and other similarities, the game is set to be more straightforward and linear than similar-looking    Metroidvania games like     Shadow Complex. Players gain levels as they work their way through three large environments, each of which ends with a boss fight. As the player level increases, new animations and knife combos are unlocked. The knife is the primary weapon, and like the original         Rush'N Attack, any weapons that can be collected come with a very limited ammo count, and they're tossed aside when empty.  The game can be played with as much or as little stealth as the player chooses to use. If playing in run-and-gun style, the player may trip alarms, causing more enemies to appear. If the player desires a stealthy approach,   EMP grenades can be used to disable  alarms and melee attacks on unaware enemies will silently and instantly dispatch them.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26706">Shadow Complex</game><game id="20483">Bionic Commando Rearmed</game><game id="24739">Trine</game><game id="25637">Shank</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1839027-box_rnaep.png</image></root>
