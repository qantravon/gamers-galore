Clank sees a hooded figure tripping the laser wires, and when security swarms the scene, the hooded figure is revealed to be Ratchet. Clank returns to his ship and watches a news feed that shows Ratchet being taken to prison for the theft. Ratchet seems completely out of character, stating his disgust towards heroism and its lack of rewards. He even makes a half-hearted referance to Clank, calling him a "two-bit bag o' bolts". Clank is convinced that Ratchet could not have done this, and sets out to clear his friends name. During his investigation, Clank will travel to various locales, meet new characters, and will have a multitude of weapons, gadgets and vehicles at his disposal.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14604">Daxter</game><game id="3438">MediEvil II</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="1563">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage</game><game id="14258">MediEvil Resurrection</game><game id="3457">MediEvil</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="15991">Chameleon Twist 2</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="25720">Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier</game><game id="21460">Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure</game><game id="25423">Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</game><game id="35545">Fuse</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1832163-box_sac.png</image></root>
