In  both modes, not only do you need to create a path to keep your rocket  fueled, but you'll also have to account for immovable tiles and special  tiles that upgrade your rocket or give you additional time to complete  the level, all while keeping your rocket's flight path within the  established boundaries.  The launch countdown has begun – are you  prepared? </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6087/1703686-cover_medium.jpg</image></root>
