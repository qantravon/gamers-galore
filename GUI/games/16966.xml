Initially developed by    Nintendo RD1 and published by     Nintendo, the game has been released in a variety of forms and versions since its original release. The ports of the game include the       Game Boy version (which changes little from the NES version), a   SNES version (which reskinned the game to reference      Super Mario World more frequently), and inclusion in a Japan-only compilation for the  GameCube titled Nintendo Puzzle Collection. Â The game included on Nintendo Puzzle Collection is technically an enhanced port of Yoshi's Cookie. There are added things, however, such as upgraded graphics and sound. Other than that, the game is completely identical to the        Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game). GameplayThe game is made up of a square grid, broken up into 25 sections (5 x 5). Cookies of various decorations fill in the entire grid. The player manipulates an entire row of five either horizontally or vertically to try to match cookies that are alike. Once a row is filled with cookies of the same design, their point count increases by one and the row is wiped off of the screen.The multiplayer portion of this game has two of the cookie grids side by side, with a different player controlling each grid while different power-ups cycle on the screen. Once a player correctly aligns a row of cookies, the power up on the screen at that time is put upon the opposing player. This could range from losing five points to scrambling the cookies on their grid.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14169">Bejeweled</game><game id="17641">Dr. Mario</game><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="18287">Hexic</game><game id="13130">Tetris Attack</game><game id="10628">Kirby's Star Stacker</game><game id="25991">Drop7</game><game id="32051">Mawashite Tsunageru Touch Panic</game><game id="38487">Harapeko Bakka</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2098017-box_yoshicook.png</image></root>
