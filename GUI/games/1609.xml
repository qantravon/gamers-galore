<root><id>1609</id><name>Skies of Arcadia</name><description>OverviewSkies of Arcadia is a role-playing game for the Dreamcast, released in Japan on October 5, 2000 as Eternal Arcadia. In the US it was released as Skies of Arcadia on November 13, 2000. It was developed by Overworks (subsequently known as Sega WOW) and published by Sega. Skies of Arcadia: Legends was a port of the Dreamcast version and featured 24 new discoveries, a new sub-plot featuring a character named Piastol, a new bounty system that rewarded the player for defeating typically new optional bosses and a few extra weapons and items.StoryThe story centers around Vyse, a young man who wishes to travel the air as a sky pirate. His father is the captain of the pirate crew, the Blue Rogues. As the group sails through the skies, they run into a warship of the Valuan Empire attacking a young girl's ship, so they decide to take advantage of the distracted ship and raid it. Vyse and his companion Aika board the ship in search of valuables, but they run into Fina, the mysterious girl who was being attacked. They rescue her and the Blue Rogues head back to Pirate Island, their headquarters.After they land, Vyse, Aika, and Fina see a stone fall to a nearby island and decide to investigate. When they return, they find that the Valuan army has attacked their home in retribution, and have captured many of their friends and family. Now the three companions must find a way to break into the Valuan Empire, rescue their friends, and find out why Fina is so important to their enemies.GameplaySkies of Arcadia offers fairly standard turn-based RPG combat: it has physical attacks, spells, and special attacks unique to each character. Players choose the action they will take before a turn and then watch the characters and the enemies alternate turns attacking each other. Character agility and attack choices effect the order in which the characters will take turns. The gameplay mechanic that sets this system apart from other rpg's is that there is one pool of energy that the whole party can draw upon to perform magic and special abilities. This brings a new dynamic to the fights since you have to think ahead about what moves you are going to use. Alternatively, each player can perform a focus action to add "spirit points" to the group and can more easily access super moves or a special crew attack when you fill up the pool. It is also important to keep your party alive as when a character is unconscious that characters "spirit points" are no longer added to the pool at the beginning of the players turn, limiting player options.Another aspect that this game shares with other rpg's is the idea that the enemies have weakness to certain elements. In the game you gain access to different crystals imbued with elements as you progress through the story. You are allowed to change the elements of your weapon at any time during the fight without any penalty. This allows the player to change up their strategy on the fly and gain the upper hand when fighting bosses of regular monster. When you finished fight you will get points based on the element set to your weapon at the end of the fight. The characters also get a smaller fraction of points if someone else in your party has their weapon set to a different element. This is the basic magic system of the game, each color corresponds to a certain element.Red- Fire, increase strengthGreen-Healing magic, poisonBlue- Water/Wind magic, increase speedPurple- Ice magic, can cast silence to negate special/magic attacksYellow- Lightning magic, can lower enemy defenseSilver- Life and Death magicBattles In The Sky!Skies of Arcadia also features a airship-to-airship battle system, which are a fusion on the turn based combat that is featured in Skies of Arcadia with some interesting elements borrowed from strategy rpg's. These battle are heavily dependent on planning ahead as victory is often dependent on landing multiple attacks to strike at the same time. For example, you could launch a torpedo to hit in three rounds then shoot a gun that hits for two rounds, so on the third round when you shoot your regular guns you also land the torpedoes you fired before, letting you score massive damage on your enemy.You can also customize your air ship with better weapons as well as gather crew members for your ship which will give it bonus features that can be called upon in combat. Another feature of the airship combat is the ability to perform a special attack. These special attacks can only be called upon once you get your ship into the right position as well as have enough points to perform the attack. This requires the player to out maneuver the enemy to get into position.CharactersAirship battles have serious consequencesThese Character descriptions are based upon the Character introductions given in the Skies of Arcadia Legends manual.Vyse: Young Pirate who dreams of grasping the limits of the skies.
