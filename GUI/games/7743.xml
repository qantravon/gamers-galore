Graphics and controls were among some of the improvements.

However, new information comes to the Government Forces relating to a rebel army led by Lieutenant Colonel Macba. The army, Special Strike Force Phantom, has began war against the Government Forces, even going so far as to take some of their own soldiers hostage. The threat becomes even more real when it is revealed that the enemy forces are working in collaboration with aliens, vastly increasing the technology and weapons of their forces. It is up to the Special Forces Squad Peregrine Falcons to put an end to the threat.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="5708">Metroid II: Return of Samus</game><game id="8292">Super Metroid</game><game id="10323">Metroid Fusion</game><game id="17356">Metroid: Zero Mission</game><game id="12296">Metal Storm</game><game id="24997">Eduardo the Samurai Toaster</game><game id="26481">Bionic Commando</game><game id="30945">Bionic Commando Rearmed 2</game><game id="39627">Intrusion 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11059/305835-ms2ndmjap.jpg</image></root>
