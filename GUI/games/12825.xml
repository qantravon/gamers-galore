When ever you do 3 combos you can use a random power up identified by a colour. Each time you have to choose one of the tree appearing colours at random and their the game will use a random tier power up from that colour.  The game ends when one player reaches the top (loss) or reaches level 10 (win).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5487">Columns</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33863/1528727-ver4.jpg</image></root>
