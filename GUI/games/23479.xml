<root><id>23479</id><name>Stoked</name><description>Overview Stoked has some well done environments.   Stoked is an         open world snowboarding game that lets you traverse five large        mountains. It sports an interesting dynamic real-time       weather system that changes how your character rides depending on conditions.  The five mountains featured can be fully explored, as opposed to having artificially enforced boundaries to confine the player to specific runs, and are accessed by a series of different  helicopter drop points.  Drawing more from the     SKATE school of design than the    SSX world of fast-paced trick-based racing, Stoked aims to provoke a more realistic feel of the sport.  The gameplay itself is parsed into different learning styles, and your characters animations change to reflect your specific style of play. As your trick library increases, the   NPCs on the mountain will begin to emulate your impressive moves. Stoked also offers drop-in multiplayer that allows you and your friends to create competitive or cooperative challenges or call out tricks for other people to nail.Sponsors BurtonDragon Arcus Von Zipper Eleven 686 Billabong DaKine Electric Libtech Nitro Northwave Oakly Quicksilver Ride Heart Rome Salomon TechnineProfessional Riders Travis RiceNicolas Mueller Wolle Nyvelt Annie Boulanger Romain de Marchi Tadachi Fuse Gigi Ruef Bjorn Leines</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="33">Snowboarding/Skiing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20954">Shaun White Snowboarding</game><game id="16647">Amped 3</game><game id="17149">SSX 3</game><game id="12418">SSX on Tour</game><game id="18782">SSX Tricky</game><game id="1932">SSX</game><game id="17969">SSX Blur</game><game id="15979">SSX Out of Bounds</game><game id="18946">1080° Snowboarding</game><game id="18062">Snowboard Kids</game><game id="15277">TransWorld Snowboarding</game><game id="15510">Amped 2</game><game id="1509">Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding</game><game id="7859">Snowboard Kids Plus</game><game id="24449">We Ski &amp; Snowboard</game><game id="21727">MTV Sports: Snowboarding</game><game id="20880">We Ski</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817672-box_stoked.png</image></root>
