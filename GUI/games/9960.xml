After multiple showings as a fully-independent product, Mak partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment America for its eventual release on the PlayStation Network. The game would later appear on Steam as a PC download.Everyday Shooter is a top-down shooter in the same vein as Robotron: 2084 or Geometry Wars. The player controls a small dot and can shoot in 8 directions. Hitting enemies plays music that fits into the background music that already plays in each stage. Additionally, each level has a unique graphical style and an entirely different chain reaction system. Figuring out what that system is for each level is a key to attaining high scores.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows 2000/XP/VistaProcessor: 1.7 GhzMemory: 256 MBGraphics: OpenGL compatible graphics card.Hard Drive: 36MB</description><genres><genre id="31">Dual-Joystick Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21167">Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2</game><game id="793">Super Stardust HD</game><game id="20600">Blast Factor</game><game id="17578">Rez</game><game id="20320">Synaesthete</game><game id="2320">Every Extend Extra Extreme</game><game id="14615">Every Extend</game><game id="8887">Every Extend Extra</game><game id="19512">Undertow</game><game id="22034">Rez HD</game><game id="11233">Robotron: 2084</game><game id="22478">PowerUp Forever</game><game id="22671">Bullet Candy</game><game id="20467">Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3</game><game id="21618">Echoes</game><game id="24502">Evasive Space</game><game id="6823">Apocalypse</game><game id="25470">Groov</game><game id="29759">Eclosion</game><game id="27196">Death by Cube</game><game id="31781">Cash Guns Chaos DLX</game><game id="36361">Waves</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/2299567-2299566-everydayshooter_box.jpg</image></root>
