The game takes place on the planet Tambi, where Captain Comic is sent to recover three important treasures. The game features non-linear gameplay, with multiple paths open to the player from the start of the game. Captain Comic's main attack is hurling fireballs at enemies, the effect of which are increased by collecting cans of "Blastola Cola"; the more cans you collect, the more fireballs you throw per shot. Michael Denio worked with the company Color Dreams on the NES port of the game, and it was released as an unlicensed title for the system. The NES version is considered one of the worst NES games of all time although the PC version was rather popular. The NES version was plagued by many glitches that were very apparent and many glitches that could even kill off your character. A pirated version for the SAM Coup√© was also released, under the title Pioneer Xenia. A sequel, Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality followed in 1990.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14143">Castle of Deceit</game><game id="12488">Jill of the Jungle: The Complete Trilogy</game><game id="18541">Jill of the Jungle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5911/833002-135_1.jpg</image></root>
