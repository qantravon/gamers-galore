The goal is to use your spaceship to eliminate all the aliens hatchlings before they evolve into a dangerous alien predatory and attack you. High levels increase the difficulty by shortening the time it takes for the alien predators to evolve. caption</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/279668-scan0001.jpg</image></root>
