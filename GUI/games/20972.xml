Also, Funhouse was included in the Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20994">Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection</game><game id="20450">Earthshaker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/11938-funhouseflyer.jpg</image></root>
