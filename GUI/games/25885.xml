The game removed a large amount of emphasis from the actual 'pimping' of one's ride, and placed it more upon the actual racing of said ride. Gameplay for the title appears rather linear, with closed circuit tracks appearing upon the streets of the in-game city, much like the format taken by      Need for Speed: Underground and       Need for Speed: Underground 2. Car models appear to be based upon real-world vehicles though are almost definitely not licensed. The game appears to have a damage engine, depicting the car doors opening and other signs of external damage. ReceptionUnsurprisingly, reception for Pimp my Ride: Street Racing was mixed. Both PSX Extreme and Cheat Code Central rated the game averagely, with 4/10 and 3.5/5 respectively.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26043">Midnight Race Club: Supercharged!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/955408-front_cover.jpg</image></root>
