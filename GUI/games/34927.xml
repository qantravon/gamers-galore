Wacky Waiters is a frustratingly hard game due to the difficulty of entering the elevators without falling, and the speed at which the tip meter decreases.  Wacky Waiters was released on cassette tape for the Commodore VIC-20.    </description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10315">Diner Dash</game><game id="30731">Star Wars: Cantina</game><game id="12422">Diner Dash: Flo on the Go</game><game id="7687">Diner Dash 2: Restaurant Rescue</game><game id="31246">Diner Dash: Hometown Hero</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/41561/1770211-64418.jpg</image></root>
