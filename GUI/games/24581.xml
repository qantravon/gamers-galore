<root><id>24581</id><name>Cube</name><description>Cube is a single- and multiplayer shooter based on a rather uncommon engine of the same name. One of the things that makes this game attractive is its price point and availability: Cube is completely free and open source. The game allows in-engine editing of geometry in full 3D (similar to WYSIWYG technology), this can even be done in multiplayer modes. The editor uses fine grain vertex lighting, which allows the user to create very dynamic lights and shadows. The game has a fully integrated client/server networking, which is generally lag free.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3874">Quake III Arena</game><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="24798">Nexuiz</game><game id="34822">AssaultCube</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15228/816949-screenshot_1790545.jpg</image></root>
