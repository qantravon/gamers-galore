It is a turn-based strategy game (with light RPG elements) that allows the player to reenact nearly every Gundam series from the original 1979 anime to Gundam X (with bonus scenarios for the then-recent Turn A Gundam). It would later receive a companion game named SD Gundam G Generation-F.I.F. and a semi-remake in     SD Gundam G Generation Portable.  ScenariosMobile Suit Gundam (10 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team (4 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: The Blue Destiny (4 Stages)   Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes (5 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket (2 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (5 Stages)Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (10 Stages)Gundam Sentinel (4 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (6 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack (2 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway's Flash (3 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam F90 (3 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam Silhouette Gundam F91 (3 Stages)Mobile Suit Gundam F91 (2 Stages)Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam (6 Stages)Mobile Suit Victory Gundam (9 Stages)Mobile Fighter G Gundam (8 Stages)New Mobile Report Gundam Wing (10 Stages)New Mobile Report Gundam Wing Dual Story: G-Unit (5 Stages)New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz (2 Stages)After War Gundam X (9 Stages)Turn A Gundam (1 Stage; unlocked after all other scenarios are completed)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/1421538-ggenf.jpg</image></root>
