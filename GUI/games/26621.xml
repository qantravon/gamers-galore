The game was meant to be an action RPG set in an open Caribbean environment and taking place before the events of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The game featured moral choices to dictate if players became a "legendary" or "dreaded" (read: good or evil) pirate. Skill trees and the physical appearance of the character changed depending on how the choices panned out. The game was cancelled in October 2010 following a restructuring of Propaganda Games teams.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8852">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords</game><game id="27878">Fable III</game><game id="20981">Age of Pirates: Captain Blood</game><game id="35702">Raven's Cry</game><game id="41179">Caribbean!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1048/1044955-potc_aotd02.jpg</image></root>
