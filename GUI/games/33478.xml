Players must aim at the windows of a train and shoot them out to free captives behind each window. Initially a separate train appears to occasionally block shots, but in later rounds cars also appear to block shots and a helicopter flies in to attack the player's car.The gameplay was unique for its time, with sniping elements featured for the first time in gaming, a precursor of things to come in the more famous Golgo 13 games Top Secret Episode and The Mafat Conspiracy.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28494">Golgo 13: Moretti Ichizoku Zansatsu Jiken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2359842-916286_8535_front.jpeg</image></root>
