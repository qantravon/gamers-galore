At the end is a dragon-like boss, defeating which allows the player to progress to the next stage.The hero is able to equip three different projectile weapons: Two types of dagger and a morning star. In true Ghouls n Ghosts fashion, however, he can only pick up one and use it at any given time. The player is also able to call upon "the spirit of the woods": a large, somewhat sinister face that eradicates enemies on the screen but is a very finite resource. The player can also collect gems for points.ReceptionThough the platformer received middling reviews - it was deemed too difficult by most, even with its generous ten lives - it was universally praised for its atmospheric chiptune music by David Whittaker.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17031">Ghosts 'N Goblins</game><game id="15544">Super Mario Bros.</game><game id="14274">Commander Keen 1: Marooned on Mars</game><game id="15799">DuckTales</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/629365-beyond_the_ice_palace.jpg</image></root>
