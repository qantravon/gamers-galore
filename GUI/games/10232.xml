You can pick any of the ships from Wing Commander 2 and pit them against enemies of your choosing using the built-in mission editor, or try to get the highest score in the infinite wave based survival mode pitting you against increasingly difficult enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15483">Star Wars: X-Wing Vs.
