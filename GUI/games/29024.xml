<root><id>29024</id><name>Dark</name><description>Developed by Andrew Russell and an entrant into the 2009 Dream Build Play competition, Dark is a short, stylised platformer. It has a stark visual design, minimalist music and very little in the way of narrative. However the end result is a charming and visually interesting indie game.Despite coming out a long time before the XBL smash-hit Limbo, several parallels can be drawn between the two games including the stripped down sound design both in terms of sound effects and music. Both games also include a very simplistic visual style although Limbo's is much more detailed. Both Limbo and Dark also rely heavily on 'player interpreation' with little to no narrative in both games, it is up to the player to ascertain what is happening.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/34728/1168508-xboxboxart.jpg</image></root>
