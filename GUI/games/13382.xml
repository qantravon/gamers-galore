Make sure to collect all parts of the  key to the next level on your way. There is also the usual array of helpful power ups to be collected on the way, such as snowflakes and mini-coyotes. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20205">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</game><game id="12022">Superfrog</game><game id="11100">Pac-in-Time</game><game id="1922">The Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse</game><game id="31282">Jump Jack</game><game id="2941">Chuck Rock</game><game id="18912">Rolling Ronny</game><game id="8541">Titus the Fox: To Marrakech and Back</game><game id="4406">Leander</game><game id="7714">TwinWorld: Land of Vision</game><game id="32930">Charly the Clown</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73970/1408484-fireandice_eu_front.jpg</image></root>
