The second, golden eggs, the player gets by using real world money. This allows the player to unlock stuff. The game will not have Ettins or Grendels upon release, but the developer, Fishing Cactus said that they might add it later. The design of the game is stylized differently. The Norn’s are more mouse like, with smaller eyes, and more realistic fur. The first real Shee appears in this game, and looks nothing like the statues, or images we have seen before, that’s probably because he was modeled off of Doc Brown from Back to the Future. When you breed Creatures you are given a popup allowing you to pick and choose what genes you want.The game was originally slated for Q2 2012 but got delayed.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73108/2215117-banner.png</image></root>
