For example, the numbers for the currently selected row and column are enlarged, and the numbers can be marked to remind you that a row or column is completed. Rather than just a grid of available puzzles, the main mode now has you controlling Mario, walking to each puzzle in an environment. The Wario's Picross mode from Mario's Super Picross also makes a return, featuring no time limits but also notification when you make a mistake. The puzzle sizes have also been bumped up - Easy Picross jumps all the way up to the 15x15 cap of the original game, while the main mode throws massive 30x30 puzzles at you, completed in four 15x15 stages.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6944">Mario's Super Picross</game><game id="6316">Mario's Picross</game><game id="19050">Picross DS</game><game id="23181">Picross NP</game><game id="23984">Picross 3D</game><game id="38154">Picross e2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10831/508147-577353_17362_front.jpg</image></root>
