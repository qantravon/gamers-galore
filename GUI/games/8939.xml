The story line involved a talisman that could control mankind, and a tournament hosted by the gods to decide who gets to keep it. The game allowed for up to four players to fight each other in a battle royal, which was a selling point, however in spite of the Xena license being popular at the time, numerous glitches within the game and a slew of bad reviews meant that it enjoyed very little success Â Characters   Xena Caesar Gabrielle Ephiny Ares Velasca Callisto Joxer Lao Ma Autolycus </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10682">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48222/1478528-199364_43315_front.jpg</image></root>
