Each stage has a different setting, including forests and mountains, with a wide range of hazards to dodge. The game is designed to allow for scenario disks. To finish a stage, you must stop at the gas station by yourself, which allows you to refuel.</description><genres><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14742-1.jpg</image></root>
