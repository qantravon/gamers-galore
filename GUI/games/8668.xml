All objects in the game have realistic movements involving their weight, size and shape.  They can be stacked, dropped, thrown and slid along the floor which gave the game its uniqueness over its peers. This also led to the game being quite hard in places since small objects were very hard to manipulate and fighting enemies demanded perfection due to the exactness of the pixel collision detection.   The game actually had no sound at all, just a piece of music at the title screen. However the graphics with their black on color background were very detailed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4560/493196-fairlight.jpg</image></root>
