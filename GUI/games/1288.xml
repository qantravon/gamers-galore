<root><id>1288</id><name>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes</name><description>Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes is a 4 player    dungeon-crawling adventure game similar to   Gauntlet. The game is loosely based on the 3rd Edition of Dungeons and Dragons.  Much of that is in items and  spells, and not as much in gameplay.  You can play as a        human-fighter, a             dwarven-           cleric, a           halfling-rogue, or an          elf-        wizard.  Each player must pick one of those characters in multiplayer, and are not able to pick the same character as someone else.In the story, all 4 characters are brought back to life to fight a wizard they defeated over a century ago.  You fight such       bosses as      Beholders, and other     Dungeons and Dragons enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3661">Shining Force: Neo</game><game id="8102">The Bard's Tale</game><game id="16327">Justice League Heroes</game><game id="10846">Avatar: The Last Airbender</game><game id="16449">Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows</game><game id="13091">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</game><game id="12107">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2437065-box_dadh.png</image></root>
