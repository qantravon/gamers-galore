The game plays out similar to a platformer but instead of sidescrolling, the protagonist ascends the tower vertically, avoiding and fighting all sorts of foes. Some of the leves are played from a top-down perspectives as well. Even though the game is based on the Disney character, the setting and other creatures/characters do not resemble those that populated the Disney cartoons or animated shorts.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2260274-mmtcgboxart.jpg</image></root>
