Although a similar service existed in North America under the name of Sega Channel, Sonic Eraser was never released outside of its original territory and thusly became one of the more unknown games in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. After the Meganet service was terminated, Sonic Eraser appeared in downloadable form in Japan game through a PC emulation service offered by Sega in that nation.GameplayAn example of the gameplay fieldSonic Eraser employs a number of conventions which are still common to games of its genre today, including a random generation of pieces, gravitational system, and a premise of matching symbols together in order to keep the board as clear as possible. Unlike similar games, however, its pieces don't rotate. Instead, they remain within predefined shapes and the player can manipulate which positions the individual symbols take within those boundaries.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="1916">Puyo Puyo</game><game id="17641">Dr. Mario</game><game id="5487">Columns</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/429/517350-sonic_eraser__j__1.jpg</image></root>
