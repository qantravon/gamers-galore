However, the moon has offered vast resources for Earth's greatest countries.The most powerful nations staked their claims for the moon's riches and much fighting has occurred. The evil Axis Empire has been behind much of this terror.Finally, on april 6, 2089, the Axis Empire's army launches an all out attack and captures most of the moon. All innocent people must now fight or perish.The Axis army now occupies most of the moon's factories where they are continually producing new weapons for their secret assault on the planet Earth.The Axis secret police have rounded up many members of the Allied Powers and put them in prisons. Without their key people, the Allied Powers stands little chance.Meanwhile, the Axis Empire draws closer to launching their "S.A.M." or Supreme Atomic Missile…the weapon they will use to destroy the Earth.The Allied Powers know they must free their prisoners if they stand a chance to stop the S.A.M. before launch time.You must free the prisoners and stop this military madness before the Axis Empire and their secret weapon S.A.M. destroy the Earth and all its people!!!GameplayThe goal of Military Madness is to destroy all enemy units or capture the enemy base in each of the game's 16 levels. The player starts the first level with basic units. As they progress through the levels more units become available. A turn consists of moving and/or attacking with each unit one by one. Units can be restored in factories. Only infantry units can take over factories and the enemy base. Attackers and defenders get bonuses for certain formations with nearby units (or the "Zone of Control"), such as the surround effect. The type of terrain a unit is on affects the possible distance it can travel as well as its defensive ability. Units become more powerful by gaining experience for each battle they survive.UnitsA variety of units allow for many strategic possibilities. They are divided up as follows:Foot Soldiers- Weak units that can capture bases and factories.Charlie GX-77Kilroy GX-87Panther CBX-1Tanks- The most common ground unit, with varied power and range.Bison S-61Lenet TT-1Polar PT-6Grizzly T-79Slagger GS-81Titan GT-86Giant HMB-2Lightweight Armored Vehicles- Weaker units that can move, attack, and move again in one turn.Rabbit MB-5Lynx MB-4Combat Aircraft- Very long ranged.
