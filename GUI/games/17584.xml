Like Sonic, Awesome Possum consisted of fast side scrolling levels, an anthropomorphic main character and a mad scientist as the antagonist. The main gimmick that sets Awesome Possum apart is its large amount of digitized speech, which both Awesome Possum and Dr. Machino will recite ad nauseum.The game features a strong environmentalist message. Awesome Possum collects recyclable materials including cans and bottles, the main enemies in the game are evil robots who are destroying the rainforest, and the main villain is Dr. Machino, who's goal is to destroy the Earth by way of pollution. Additionally, Awesome Possum features quizzes about the environment that the player can answer for extra points.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20205">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</game><game id="2866">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</game><game id="2998">High Seas Havoc</game><game id="11083">Rocky Rodent</game><game id="15738">Donkey Kong Country</game><game id="12297">Sonic Mega Collection Plus</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/148121/2105213-awesomepossumf.jpg</image></root>
