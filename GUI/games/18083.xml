Mortal Kombat: Special Forces is a 3D top-down action game developed and published by                      Midway on July 30, 2000 for the  Sony PlayStation. Part of the                     Mortal Kombat franchise, Mortal Kombat: Special Forces is a                 spin-off title to the fighting game series and, like                Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (released three years prior), serves as a prologue to the original               Mortal Kombat while focusing on a narrow group of primary characters. While primary a 3D beat-em-up, the game used many mechanics made commonplace in other game genres at the time, such as the             experience point and  item system of RPGs and a restrictive              first-person shooter mechanic.The game puts players as the role of steel-armed                    Jackson "Jax" Briggs, a Major of the  United States           Special Forces, as he hunts down          Kano, leader of the infamous Black Dragon gang, with the help of his base operative, Gemini. Along the way, he encounters other Black Dragon members freed by Kano from a maximum security prison, such as the pyromaniac         No Face, expert swordswoman        Tasia, brutish second-in-command       Jarek, and hulkish brown ninja      Tremor. He soon learns, however, that Kano has an otherworldly goal in mind.Â      Sonya Blade was originally slated to appear as a second playable character alongside Jax, but was cut out.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1774561-box_mksf.png</image></root>
