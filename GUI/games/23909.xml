To get around, Mappy rides on a pogo stick instead of just walking or whatever like a normal police mouse. Mappy can only move up, down, left, and right because the Mouse Police didn't bother training him to move diagonally.  However there are cats to avoid, and they are also on pogo sticks, so Mappy needs to watch out, otherwise he may end up pogoing his way to certain doom!  He and the cats can only touch the center of each square on a stage, leaving them to move in a grid pattern.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23911">Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1</game><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="3353">Rolling Thunder</game><game id="279">Wonder Momo</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1710655-filehopping_mappy_flyer.jpg</image></root>
