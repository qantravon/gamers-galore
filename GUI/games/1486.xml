The main character could only use bullets to propel himself, and when the bullet count reaches 0, the game ends. A player can also lose bullets by colliding with an enemy, the other player, or the other player's bullets.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3758">Kickle Cubicle</game><game id="11353">Arkista's Ring</game><game id="12296">Metal Storm</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2413258-astro_robo_sasa.jpg</image></root>
