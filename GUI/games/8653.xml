He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16837">Switchblade II</game><game id="2536">Altered Beast</game><game id="14351">Golden Axe</game><game id="9308">Assassin</game><game id="4406">Leander</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363102-ms_wolfchild_eu.jpg</image></root>
