Although it has no licensed content, it closely emulates the vehicles and tracks of the Championship Off Road Racing (CORR) series. Players can drive trucks or buggies on 12 different tracks, and upgrade their vehicle in career mode.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18456">SODA Off-Road Racing</game><game id="22272">Super Off Road: The Baja</game><game id="9509">Ivan "Iron Man" Stewart's Super Off Road</game><game id="835">Off Road Challenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/30196/1916227-lead.jpg</image></root>
