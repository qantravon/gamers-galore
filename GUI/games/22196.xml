<root><id>22196</id><name>Requiem: Bloodymare</name><description>The game revolves around a world based through three main servers.  These servers are portal worlds where human life is thinning and monsters are destroying and killing the last few remnants of civilizations and cities, defenceless.  There are many different races while all of them have the same goal and that is ultimately to regain control over the world and expand their own beliefs upon others.  The history of the game revolves around heavy wars resulting in the slaughter between races.  The player controls an enhanced, cybernetic human who begins the game with hours of lore to read and repeated quests to perform before setting out into the world in the deeper regions of these servers.     The official game website can be found at  http://www.playrequiem.com and is entirely free.  Premium accounts are available to those who wish to purchase them, or the Gravity game cards. </description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22085">CABAL Online</game><game id="5959">ArchLord</game><game id="17494">Guild Wars</game><game id="25547">Neo Steam: The Shattered Continent</game><game id="21399">Last Chaos</game><game id="22239">Runes of Magic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2352/333869-requiem_online_official_logo.jpg</image></root>
