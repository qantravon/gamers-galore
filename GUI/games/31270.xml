The character has the option to choose from a selection of avatars, while the Bachelors and Bachelorettes are based on the real-life TV series. In the single-player mode, the game plays much like the TV show, where the character plays through a number of episodes, competing against other game characters for time alone with the Bachelor or Bachelorette.In the Wii version of the game, the multiplayer mode allows the players to compete against each other. They have the option of sabotaging others' dates and preventing them from receiving roses, which act as points in the game.During each season, the characters go on One-On-One Dates and Group Dates in the interest of earning hearts. These dates mainly compose of challenges, puzzles and mini-games involving memory, speed, and observation. At the end of the season, the hearts for each character are added up and in the end one character receives the Final Rose.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31614">Wipeout: The Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/35266/1451078-140325e.jpg</image></root>
