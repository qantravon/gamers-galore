While the original game was basically a Contra clone with added features, the sequel was an over the top shooting feast. The game featured advanced 16-bit graphics using the same arcade hardware as the original game. The game was done by the same team who would later leave Irem, and go on to make the Metal Slug series of games for SNK's console the Neo-Geo. The gameplay, graphics, and sound quality are very similar to the Metal Slug franchise. Because of this, GunForce II is considered by fans to be "Metal Slug Zero."</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13902">Contra: Hard Corps</game><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game><game id="11973">Gunstar Super Heroes</game><game id="18">Metal Slug X: Super Vehicle - 001</game><game id="1063">Metal Slug 3</game><game id="2018">Metal Slug 4</game><game id="20743">Metal Slug 7</game><game id="19020">Metal Slug Anthology</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2254071-gn.png</image></root>
