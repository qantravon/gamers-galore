The game was released to much acclaim within fan circles and was quickly ported to a variety of platforms including Linux, Game Boy Advance and Atari ST. Distribution of the title was cancelled in 2003 after David Braben (one of the original developers) requested that Pinder cease producing the title.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10902">Elite</game><game id="16330">Frontier: Elite II</game><game id="31364">Oolite</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/707983-1202005522_01.png</image></root>
