Known for its intense level of detail and historical accuracy, the series has had several sequels, including Forgotten Battles and 1946. With Birds of Prey, however, Il-2 will be making its first appearance on consoles, releasing in 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, PSP, and DS.   Birds of Prey will feature both arcade and simulation mode, the former tailored for new console pilots that aren't familiar with the series. Pilots will get to dogfight in 50 missions ranging from the Battle of Britain to Sicily, emphasizing a significant shift in Il-2's traditional focus on Europe's Eastern Front.
