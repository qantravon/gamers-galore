Those are the only names that will be given for these characters in order to let players "inject themselves" into the two more than they did for  Salem and  Rios. Post ReleaseGame was originally advertised up until release to be developed by Visceral Games.  Final copy has no mention of Visceral Games on cover or in game credits.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26394">Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days</game><game id="19874">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men</game><game id="34106">Call of Juarez: The Cartel</game><game id="38481">Gears of War: Judgment</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2452870-box_aottdc.png</image></root>
