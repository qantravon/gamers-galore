II</name><description>TriviaThe Amstrad version of the game is extremely rare in the United Kingdom.Some English PAL regions received a release of this title under the Japanese name (Super H.Q). These cartridges were made using the first generation Mega Drive casing which made them incompatible with the model 2 Megadrive/Genesis. As a result model 2 owners required the use of an Action Replay or Game Genie to play this title.Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the game a score of 8 out of 10. He wrote, "...a nice twist to the usual behind-the-car perspective of so many racing games: you get to bash the criminals to a halt!"</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19714">Fire and Forget</game><game id="18496">MegaRace</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2179127-chasehq2_erbe_.jpg</image></root>
