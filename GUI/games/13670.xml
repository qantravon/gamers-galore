These ports come in all kinds of shapes, from orange, to green and red. You can stack up several ports, until you ultimately form a combo, granting you everything from speed, jumping to invisibility. Some combos are required to pass through special walls, where inside you can enter a secret level, giving you the opportunity to unlock secret, special buggy racers.Gameplay picture.In the picture to the right, you can see a red port in the top middle of the picture, and a forecoming combo in the bottum left.The game also has 10+ unlockable buggy racers.

All these stats factor in the usefulness of the buggy, where as speed is good for prolonged fast races, acceleration is good for short races, grip is good for races with a lot of corners, and weight is good for bumping into other buggys.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3361/2335983-buggy_psx.jpeg</image></root>
