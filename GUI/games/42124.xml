The game takes place in the distant future as a war rages between big-brained Martians and Robots. It uses the GNU General Public License of the id Tech 2 engine. There is also single player through the use of configurable bots. The first release featured 5 player characters, 10 levels, and 9 weapons (both of alien and human nature). It featured vertex lighting on models, textured particles, stainmaps, and hi-res full color textures and skins. The HUD shows player deaths and high scorer at all times. All source code was released with game. 

Version 2.0 added three brand new 1vs1 tourney levels, scripted shaders, quad and invulnerability shell effect added on weapon model and glass effects (helmets, tubes, etc) and intermission sequences were improved.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Fighting</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10631-1.jpg</image></root>
