The player must follow a path around a river fighting increasingly stronger opponents at every stop.The player has a selection of punches and kicks to rely on, with tougher moves such as a flying kick and a leg sweep requiring more complex inputs. In addition, a flashing bar will increase each time the player is attacked and once it is full the player can unleash a devastating fireball attack. Each fight consists of two rounds, with the player needing to beat both rounds in order to proceed - though as an added level of challenge the player does not recover health between rounds, unlike the opponent.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game><game id="15480">Yie Ar Kung-Fu</game><game id="9948">Karateka</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/558243-fighting_road_box.jpg</image></root>
