<root><id>18341</id><name>Space Jam</name><description>OverviewSpace Jam is a 3-on-3 arcade basketball game developed by Sculptured and published by Acclaim for the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC in 1996/1997. It is the spiritual sequel to Sculptured's other Looney Tunes-themed basketball game (Looney Tunes B-Ball), tying into the 1996 film of the same name.The game is set in a basketball match (in similar vein to the NBA Jam franchise) between the Tune Stars (a group of Looney Tunes characters, with the help of a then-retired NBA superstar Michael Jordan) and the Monstars (a group of criminal aliens, called "The Nerdlucks", who have literally stolen the basketball talent of famous NBA players). Before the match starts (and in-between match quarters), players can participate in a variety of mini-games loosely based on events in the movie (and can gain advantages in the main game by winning them).Friend of the site Dave Lang programmed some of the menus and mini-games of the Sega Saturn version of the game.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6694">Michael Jordan:  Chaos in the Windy City</game><game id="17850">Looney Tunes B-Ball</game><game id="11206">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</game><game id="10512">NBA Hangtime</game><game id="14792">NBA Jam Tournament Edition</game><game id="61">NBA Street V3</game><game id="9866">NBA Street Vol. 2</game><game id="7982">NBA Street</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1811179-box_spacejam.png</image></root>
