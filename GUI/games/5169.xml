The game was eventually announced for release in the United States as Samba de Amigo: Ver. 2001, though it was canceled when Sega stopped supporting the Dreamcast. Ver. 2000 featured 14 new songs and 6 new downloadable songs. While instead of the three songs per stage in the original, Ver. 200 allowed the player to choose several. The Couples version from the original Dreamcast version was now included in the arcade version.Ver. 2000 also introduce a new character, Amiga, who is Amigo's sister and plays a tambourine. Instead of the minigames in Party Mode from the original game, they were all replaced with a volleyball game. A new Survival Mode was also added, in which the player must complete as many songs in a row as possible.There was also new challenges added to the Challenge Mode, as well as 5 new secret stages.Finally, Ver. 2000's biggest addition was Hustle Mode. At first, Hustle Mode seems to be the same as the Original Mode. However, the main catch of Hustle Mode is that posing is more important than hitting notes. The player must do these poses while also shaking the maracas while holding the pose, as well as sometimes have to do a complete 360 degree rotation. Every song in the game featured an Original and Hustle version, adding a new dimension to the game.
