The game a side-scrolling action game where the player controls Marion Cobretti as he tries to defeat the cult of the Night Slasher and protect model Ingrid from their wrath. The game is best known for its music score and its high level of difficulty. The music is arranged by Ben Daglish. Due to a rush to get the game out in time for the film's release, there was no final boss programmed in to end the game so once the first three levels are completed, the game repeats.Health is represented by an on-screen cheeseburger that deteriorates as Cobretti takes damage.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15457">Rush'n Attack</game><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="21323">RoboCop</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1731/235934-front.jpg</image></root>
