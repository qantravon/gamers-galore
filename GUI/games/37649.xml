Initially you will pick a class; Prowess, Fortitude, or Cunning, but you are free to explore as much as you like on the fly with the other two. Crafting also lets you change your weapons to suit your path to allow greater flexibility.Co-op and PVP are going to be added in the final build, but no timeline of when these features are going to make it into the beta.PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS:Windows XP or newerMemory:1 GB RAMHard Drive:700 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:2 GB RAMHard Drive:1 GB HD spaceOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connectionMac System RequirementsMinimum:OS:Mac OS 10.6 or newerMemory:1 GB RAMHard Drive:700 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:2 GB RAMHard Drive:1 GB HD spaceOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connectionLinux System RequirementsMinimum:OS:xUbuntu 12.04Memory:1 GB RAMHard Drive:700 MB HD spaceRecommended:Memory:2 GB RAMHard Drive:1 GB HD spaceOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connectionExternal LinksOfficial siteKickstarter page</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25983">Torchlight</game><game id="20803">Diablo III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/122165/2142807-429973_10150598478262075_540107074_9266818_721872821_n.jpg</image></root>
