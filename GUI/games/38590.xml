These followers are aligned with three elements (fire, water and earth) and this forms the basis of a rock, paper, scissors battle system where players should use the appropriate element to maximize their attacks against enemies. Troops can be assigned four different types when ordering them. </description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2405">Pikmin</game><game id="2480">Pikmin 2</game><game id="27930">Pikmin 3</game><game id="14147">Patapon</game><game id="21113">Patapon 2</game><game id="31751">Patapon 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2341393-orgar.png</image></root>
