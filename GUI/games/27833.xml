After the toy cowboy Woody is kidnapped by an evil toy collector, Buzz Lightyear and friends set out to rescue him in a side-scrolling platformer that takes them through a number of locations from the film. The game only has Buzz playable since Woody is the so-called "damsel in distress" this time around. Buzz can shoot lasers out of his wrists and has some pretty cool moves too. The gameplay is basic platformer, with Buzz running and jumping from left to right and climbing stuff to collect keys, batteries and power-ups.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285747-box_ts2.png</image></root>
