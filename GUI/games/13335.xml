In this game, your objective is to steer your "Ramroid" up and down the path in the center of the stage while shooting the various colored bars approaching you from the sides. Shooting one of these bars will push it back and score you points, while ignoring one will cause it to move closer and threaten your character. Once a bar has been pushed off the stage, it disappears. Once every bar has been pushed off the screen, the stage ends and a new one begins.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5278/317013-ram_it.jpg</image></root>
