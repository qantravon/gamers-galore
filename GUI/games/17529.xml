In Puss N Boots the player guides an anthropomorphic cat named Pero on his quest to return to his proper place in time. Pero must pass through 7 levels consisting of basic platforming with several freely chosen weapons, side scrolling vehicle levels, and boss fights. Puss N Boots: Pero's Great Adventure originally came out on the Famicom only in Japan as Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Dai Bouken in 1986, but was updated four years later to become this game.Television AppearancePuss N Boots had an entire episode of the cartoon Captain N : The Game Master devoted to it in the second season. It followed the plot and themes of the video game well. Count Gruemon, an anthropomorphic pig, and Dr. Gari-gari, an anthropomorphic wolf (the final boss enemies in the game) have stolen Captain N's power pad and zapper, using them to power a time machine. Using warp zones, Captain N, Link and Pero travel through the time periods, locations, and fight similar bosses as seen in the game. Captain N and Link are trying to return to Hyrule, Pero trying to return to his home. Pero is characterized as self serving, taking advantage of Captain N and Link. In the end of the episode Pero sacrifices an easy escape to his home to help Captain N and Link return to their home as well.Other InformationPero is the mascot of Toei animation in Japan. The name Pero itself is a Japanese onomatopoeia for a licking sound. It's also thought to be an homage to Charles Perrault, the author of the original Puss in Boots novel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362134-nes_pussnboots.jpg</image></root>
