Once the game begins you play it in turns, where all players choose their actions simultaneously. Once everyone makes their choices and movements, or the timer has run out, the action then plays out in real time cinematic fashion with dynamic camera angles.The developers hope that this speeding up of the traditional turn based strategy game will draw in the people who have the attention span of a flea, and have always avoided this genre of game.As of this writing the only other bits of information we know about this game is that it will use motion capture animation, and have guns that go pew.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP 64-bitProcessor: Dual CoreMemory: 3 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia 8800GTDirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 3 GB HD spaceOther Requirements: Broadband Internet connectionRecommendedOS: Windows 7 64-bitProcessor: Dual CoreMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Nvidia GT240DirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 3 GB HD spaceOther Requirements: Broadband Internet connection</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26505">Frozen Synapse</game><game id="37152">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/29874/1704924-fray_official_logo_eps_jpgcopy.jpg</image></root>
