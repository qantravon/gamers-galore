Using Kirby's unique sucking mechanic, you can suck up enemies and shoot them out in a star burst or swallow them and take over their power. These powers range greatly from giving Kirby a parasol for glide down with to having beams of plasma snaking around him.GameplayKirby: Nightmare in Dream land plays like other games in the series. Kirby scrolls across the screen to point A to point B. In each lever there are hidden treasure chests and other secrets that unlock extra rooms in the hub worlds. The game has 7 worlds that all contain 6 rooms, a boss and other unlockable rooms including warps, rooms with power ups, small boss fights and sub-games.Sub-gamesThe sub-games, which are selectable in the main menu and in the hub world are simple games that can be played in multiplayer.Quick DrawA game where you press the A button at the perfect time to kill an enemy.Bomb Rally4 Kirbys hit a bomb back and forth at each other.
