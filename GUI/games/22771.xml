It was released on Oct. 17, 2008, and is a full standalone expansion to X3: Reunion. With it comes improvements to the engine, graphics, and gameplay, as well as a new plot. It is considered an entirely new game despite the term expansion that is applied to it.Some features included:Over 100 new ships with new weapon systems and ship classesA new faction known as the Terran who inhabit earthNew user interfaceNew missionsBoarding partiesMissile FrigatesNon Player corporationsFlight wing groupsThe Sol System can now be traveled to.Improved GraphicsGameplayThe Gameplay in X3: Terran Conflict is open ended. It does have a main plot, but you can choose when to do the missions, or you can create a custom game and not go through the plot at all, so you really do have a sense of freedom in the game. You have many options. You can fight against enemies, and build yourself an empire, you can trade with other npcs to make money, and you can build factories and hubs to further expand your resources. The world of X3 is open to you, the player. The gameplay is based on four main premises, Trade, Fight, Build and Think.TradeYou will be able to trade with other races while docked at factories, trading centers, or other in space hubs. Trade is a big part of the X Universe as it keeps the economy going. The economy is a dynamic economy based on supply and demand that is always changing. What might be in demand one day will not be another time, so you must look at what is needed to be a successful trader. You can soon be able to build your own trading empire fit with your own factories, supply and transport ships, and buyers. NPC ships will compete with you in the trading sector, so you must make sure to hold an upper edge.FightThe X Universe is a hard place, and if you don't take the fight to the enemy, they will take the fight to you. Whether it be pirates, the occasional criminal, or a Xenon sector invasion, you will be on your toes. You will be able to gain rank with factions by helping them, and the higher up you are in the ranks, the more they will help and benefit you. As you gain skill, you will be able to build a fleet of ships, and eventually, if you wanted to you can create your own Empire.BuildYou have the ability to build factories, mines and hubs in X3. You can start developing your empire by building factories and complexes to increase your resources and fulfill your needs. You can spread your corporate influence to gain new technology from different factions, while improving trade rank with those factions. You can create chains to supply everything your fleet needs to make weapons, goods, and ships themselves.ThinkThe X Universe is full of many hidden things for you to explore and discover. You may find treasures, and riches. There will be many decisions you will have to make such as where to build a factory, or what goods to trade. You can set up headquarters as a base of operations and from that you can reverse engineer all the different things you find on your travels where you can later produce them.RacesArgon FederationBoron KingdomParanidSplit DynastyTeladi CompanyXenonKha'akTerransYakiPiratesCorporationsAtreus HQ:Race: BoronLocation: Queen's HarbourUnique/Rare ware: JumpdriveDuke's Haven (HQ):Race: Paranid (rogue/unaffiliated)Location: Unknown Sector 10, 16 (South of Heaven's Assertion)Unique/rare ware: Software Signature Scrambler/Cargo Bay ShieldingJonferco HQ:Race: ArgonLocation: Belt of AguilarUnique/rare ware: Bioscanner/Transporter DeviceNMMC HQ:Race: TeladiLocation: PTNI HeadquartersUnique/rare ware: NividiumOTAS HQ:Race: ArgonLocation: Legend's HomeUnique/rare ware: Jumpdrive/Salvage InsurancePlutarch HQ:Race: ArgonLocation: Ore BeltUnique/rare ware: NividiumStrong Arms HQ:Race: SplitLocation: Thyn's ExcavationUnique/rare ware: Cargo Lifesupport System/Cargo Bay ShieldingTerraCorp HQ:Race: ArgonLocation: Home of LightUnique/rare ware: Bioscanner/Transporter Device/Jumpdrive/Salvage InsuranceUpdatesEGOSOFT has continued to support X3: Terran Conflict since release, with various new missions (some developed by the community), bug fixes and additional flight software.On 16 October 2008, the first patch for X3: Terran Conflict.Version 1.2 was available to Steam users as soon as the game was activated whereas several DVD users played with version 1.0.1 for several days before the update was available.
