Mindshadow's main objective is to completely regain your memory after you wake up on a beach without it. This is done by typing in "think" or "remember" along with the clue that is supposed to jar your memory. The game also includes an in game hint system to push you in the right direction in case you get stuck by typing "Help Condor".</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19359">Waxworks</game><game id="15875">Tass Times in Tonetown</game><game id="11559">Crime Time</game><game id="5516">Shadowgate</game><game id="3709">Déjà Vu: A Nightmare Comes True</game><game id="20040">Borrowed Time</game><game id="4156">Déjà Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas</game><game id="32884">Espen I Asmo</game><game id="19578">Scapeghost</game><game id="16306">Dream Prisoner</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17172/1137673-ms_atarist_001.png</image></root>
