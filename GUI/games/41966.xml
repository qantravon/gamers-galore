Players fill the role of The Kid, a youthful, vaguely Megaman-esque protagonist on a quest to become The Guy. This inscrutable plot, however, is just a vehicle for a wide variety of inventive, well-designed and frustrating jump-and-shoot challenges that pay homage to many of the games you loved as a child. The ever-fragile Kid explodes in a shower of red pixels at the slightest brush from the game's many obstacles, from traditional spikes and bottomless pits to more unconventional killers, such as plantlife and puzzle pieces.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Adventure</genre><genre>Platform</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/7629-1.jpg</image></root>
