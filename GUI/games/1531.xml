Max' is the action type, with an unique four-arm setup that allows you to quad-wield any weapons he pick up, and can be equipped however you want: Four uzis, or one pistol, one shotgun and two uzis, and etc.Dr. Fluke Hawkins focuses on puzzle-solving, although there is a lot of combat involved. You have two hands and two inventory spaces, which allows you to merge items, creating solutions to puzzles or inventing new weaponry. The first two basic things you need to combine are toast and a toaster, which you will be able to mix into a weapon later. The game starts off with a level with Kurt, then changes to Max, then to Fluke, and rotates in that order.StoryThe game starts directly after MDK ends, with Kurt and the others celebrating for saving the world, when they detect alien movement on the earth's surface, namely Edmonton, Canada. So now the gang must stop another invasion from the ruthless aliens.AvailabilityThe game has been re-released in its original state on digital distribution services like Steam and GOG.com.HD RemakeOn June 28th, 2010, Interplay announced plans to re-release MDK2 in high definition for the Wii and PC.
