But instead of being an action platformer like the previous games, this Ape Escape is a first-person on-rails motion controlled affair. Players make their way through 15 levels, time traveling to the past and present, using a net, a slingshot, and a fan to capture all those apes. As players progress through the story, they can also unlock additional mini-games to break up the action.The game is a PSN downloadable game in North America, but retail boxed versions exist for the rest of the worldwide markets. It was first released in Japan in December 2010, where it is known as Ape Escape Fury! Fury!, and June 22nd 2011 in Europe, where it's known as simply Ape Escape.</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31750">PlayStation Move Heroes</game><game id="25673">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time</game><game id="15212">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</game><game id="21115">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2372449-box_aem.png</image></root>
