Most notible of this content of the Story Mode, in which the characters fight each other with small bouts of dialogue in between. Also notible was the addition of the new character Cupido.  Although Takara's original game is mostly the same, it's been slightly reprogrammed and published by Sega, making for mildly different gameplay.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11822">Soulcalibur II</game><game id="2045">Dead or Alive 2</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="3744">Def Jam: Fight for NY</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="721">Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1814621-box_batr.png</image></root>
