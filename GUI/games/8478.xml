In The Evil Dead Video Game, you play as Ash battling the forces of evil using multiple weapons including an altered chainsaw and a double barrel shot gun. The game play involves the constant shutting of doors and windows in the abandoned cabin in the woods to keep out more of the evil zombies and attacking trees. Ash also must pick up weapons along the way as he battles the creatures that are already in the cabin or who enter the cabin if the doors and windows are not shut. As you defeat creatures as Ash, he gains more weapons that increase his energy to continue the fight. Once all of the creatures have been defeated, Ash must now find the Book of the Dead and destroy it to save the day and end the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2270/291355-519_1.jpg</image></root>
