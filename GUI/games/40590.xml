<root><id>40590</id><name>Sekiryuou</name><description>OverviewSekiryuou (often translated as "Red Dragon King") is a traditional Famicom adventure game from Sunsoft, in which the player controls a protagonist via a series of menus in order to solve a series of puzzles. Though Sunsoft is credited as publisher, it is unclear if the game was made in-house or contracted to another developer.The game, and the manga it is based on, depict a period of ancient Chinese history between the Qin and Han dynasties, a few decades before the Three Kingdoms era began. As expected of a transitional period, there was plenty of intrigue and conflict leading up to the change of power that future novels and mangas could draw from.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39511">Mito Koumon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2372246-sekiryuou_fc.jpg</image></root>
