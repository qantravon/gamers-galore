The remake boasts greatly enhanced graphics over its PC counterparts and full voice acting.EpisodesEpisode 5: End of the Golden WitchEpisode 6: Dawn of the Golden WitchEpisode 7: Requiem of the Golden WitchEpisode 8: Twilight of the Golden WitchGameplayFollowing the same formula of its PC counterparts, Nocturne of Truth and Illusion requires very little player input to advance the story. Every episode is divided into several chapters and the story is told almost entirely through dialogue boxes that the player can advance through by pressing the circle button, or have it play automatically by pressing the R1 button. After each episode is concluded, the player unlocks two new parts of that episode, "Tea Party" and "????", that act as an epilogue to that episode and a prologue to the next one. After finishing "????", the next episode is unlocked. In the eighth episode of the series, the player will also have to make choices as the story progresses that determine how the game ends.TranslationAlthough there are no plans to localize the PS3 remakes outside of Japan, a fan translation project have released patches for all eight of the original PC episodes that allows those games to be played in English. These can be downloaded for free from Witch-Hunt.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34897">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Matsuri</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/127673/2094912-chirucover_small.png</image></root>
