In the game, an alien ship has crash landed on Earth and released a bunch of nasty prisoner aliens, and agents J and K are tasked with cleaning up the mess.   Although the game tries to emulate the likeness' and voices of the actors from the movie, the actors were not used for the voicework in the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2171269-box_mib2ae.png</image></root>
