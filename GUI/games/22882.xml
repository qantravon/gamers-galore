Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact is a third person shooting arcade game featuring the famous Japanese               kaiju. It also contains some elements of a              rail shooter as the player has only limited control over Godzilla, which keeps on going forward all the time (except the boss battles). The game is divided into two types of stages. The first type involves causing havoc to several Japanese cities, while the other focuses on boss battles, mostly with giant creatures well known from the movies. Godzilla can             lock on the power beam on targets such as tanks, helicopters or vital point of the enemy creatures' bodies or charge it up causing a massive explosion destroying everything around. The game features destructible environments.
