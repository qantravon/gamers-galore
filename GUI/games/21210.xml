Motivated by game series such as                                   God of War and                                   Ninja Gaiden,                                   Nihilistic Software desired to create a more mature experience. Conan features a plethora of                                 gore and                                nudity, granting the title an M rating by the                               E.S.R.B.    Plot and Setting The game takes place in the world of                              Hyboria which is a fantasy version of                             Earth or around the                            stone or                           iron age. The story starts at Parad Isle where                          Conan is                        raiding a                         tomb. Instead of finding   treasure, he unknowingly frees Graven, a creature who had been trapped  in a                       magical                      prison for his past. Showing no gratitude, the creature curses Conan's                     armor, scatters it across the world, and                    teleports Conan away. He vows to find his missing armor all the while meeting allies such as A'kanna a                   pirate                  princess. Along the journey Conan fights many mythical beasts such as                 dragons or                undead               elephants.    Gameplay After unlocking an ancient evil, Conan has lost his                      armor and seeks to reclaim it.  While unraveling the mystery of the             magic that is imbued in his armor pieces, he comes across Warrior Queen A'Kanna who also has a role to play in whatever enemy pulls the strings behind their quest.  Conan utilizes weapon combinations such as a                                   sword and                                   shield, a two-handed weapon,                                   a weapon in each hand, or              no weapon at all. Through killing enemies, Conan gains                                   experience that the user uses to purchase new attack combinations and upgrade old ones. Throughout the game Conan obtains new abilities such as turning his foes into stone and summoning firestorms. Conan also features                                   Quick Time Events in which the player is prompted to hit a series of buttons in order to interact with their environment, such as pushing a                                   boulder or lifting a stone wall.There are also                                   treasure chests and                                   damsels in distress as            collectibles of sorts peppered through the game.  Symbols in groups of three, known as Triumverates, occasionally appear, giving the character an opportunity to increase their           health provided they can activate all three within a          timely manner.  Reception Frequently compared to games such as         God of War I         II,                                   Heavenly Sword, and                                   Devil May Cry, reviewers have deemed Conan an inferior addition compared to previous games in the action-adventure genre. Weak sales led Conan to be a large financial hit for THQ.
