Players are placed in one of two teams- either Empire or Consortium- and spawn on either ends of a map from where they can capture points that reward resources. One player is voted to be the commander and views the map from the top-down perspective, allowing him to place power grids, resource points turrets and perform other exclusive actions that are afforded to him by how many resources his team has been rewarded. The rest of the team plays from the first-person perspective, and chooses from various classes and kits to capture points and eliminate enemies. The ultimate goal of a match is to destroy your enemy's base.ClassesBoth the Consortium and the Empire use the same classes, though they are differentiated by team colors, aesthetics, and weapon names. Each of the four classes use three kits, with one kit for each class being unlocked only through spending resources. In addition to kits, players can choose 'gizmos' that have various effects. Effects include- but are not limited to- higher bullet damage, higher ammo capacity, etc.AssaultThe Assault class is a versatile medium armored soldier whose special ability is their Thermal Vision which allows them to spot cloaked enemies.
