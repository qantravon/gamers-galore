As in the predecessor Alien Shooter, you control your character through 2D isometric maps to find key-cards, activate machines and clear areas from the aliens. At the beginning you have the choice between 8 characters who have different skills. There's everything from a sniper to a hands-on melee fighter. You also choose one of eight special talents like self-heal or night-vision.

The Great War has begun! The world population capable of functioning is mobilized to serve in the army. Hordes of monsters are destroying the cities and capturing new territories. The situation on the battlefront reached the critical emergency point and there's nobody to help. Try to fight with the aliens as a private soldier from the regular army, which happens to be in the center of the action. The outcome depends on you!</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17268-1.jpg</image></root>
