The games are Dragon Ball Z: Budokai and Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3.The reason Namco Bandai has given for the selection of Budokai 1 and Budokai 3 was they felt those games were the stand outs in the series, and felt they both titles deserved an HD upgrade.SoundtrackAfter it was revealed composer Kenji Yamamoto (not to be confused with Super Metroid composer Kenji Yamamoto) had a history of plagiarizing music from other sources, Namco Bandai chose to remove the original soundtracks from both games in the collection. The replacement soundtracks use music taken from the Tenkaichi and Raging Blast games.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2348777-box_dbzhdc.png</image></root>
