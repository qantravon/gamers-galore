The game features two modes of play; one is the original Bubble Bubble arcade game, modified for play on the DS. The other, the titlular Bubble Bobble Revolution, features modern graphics, sound effects, and music.Game-ending GlitchBubble Bobble Revolution shipped with a game-breaking bug in the game's modern mode. The boss of Stage 30 does not appear, and because the player cannot progress until the boss is defeated, further progress is rendered impossible. This bug affects all first-run copies of the game. Codemasters subsequently apologized for the oversight and released a second run of the game with the bug fixed, and offered to replace all original copies of the game purchased by consumers free of charge.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22645">Bust-A-Move Pocket</game><game id="19154">Pok√©mon Pinball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/1035699-box_l.jpg</image></root>
