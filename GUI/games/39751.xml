Death Cargos are the ships that deliver said creatures to their destination. On December 12th, 2067, a Death cargo carried out an emergency landing on Earth due to a failure in the main engine. During the crash landing weapons were ejected out of the ship and propelled towards different places on the planet. Strangely the commander of the ship went silent during the landing as if he had perished but his vital signs confirmed that he was still alive. So a new Commander has been sent to retrieve the weapons and find out what happened to the commander. The only problem is that the weapons were activated during the crash...GameplayA battle consists of one round.
