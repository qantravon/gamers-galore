Biggest difference between the games is Liero's splitscreen view and a possibility to play alone with the AI.In Liero, two players battle it out in destructable dirt between rocks and other obstacles. Weapons include classics like uzis and shotguns and a bunch of explosives like nukes and banana bombs. There's also a ninja rope for climbing. Gameplay is pretty fast paced and there are no dull moments in Liero.  The game became a hit in the freeware scene.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13773">Soldat</game><game id="2007">Worms</game><game id="20715">Rocket Riot</game><game id="23230">Cortex Command</game><game id="31007">Booster Trooper</game><game id="5712">MoleZ</game><game id="31906">Duel: The Art of Combat</game><game id="7475">Liero Xtreme</game><game id="32738">Delve Deeper</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8169/679426-liero_1.png</image></root>
