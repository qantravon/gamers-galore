<root><id>37185</id><name>Kiki Trick</name><description>OverviewKiki Trick is a minigame compilation for the Wii developed by Nintendo in tandem with Oto Designers. As the portmanteau-laden title implies in Japanese through a combination of the Japanese word "kikitori" ("listening comprehension") and the English word "trick," the minigames focus on sound and one's listening prowess in a variety of ambiguous-sounding situations. Winning the minigames is thusly a matter of contextualizing and making sense of what the player hears with what they see on screen, with sounds being made initially confusing by means such as pacing alteration (ie: speeding up) and being paired with unfitting visual imagery.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14405">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</game><game id="15419">Soundvoyager</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/429/2099035-kikitrickbox.jpg</image></root>
