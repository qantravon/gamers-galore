It was developed by Climax Group's now-defunct Los Angeles office.Playing as the cartoon version of Lizzie that exists in her mind, the player completes a series of wacky minigame challenges in order to become homecoming queen. Each minigame lasts between 5 and 10 seconds.An expanded version of the game was slated to appear on the DS, which was to feature an additional 50 minigames based on Disney's other popular kids show at the time, That's So Raven. However, two weeks before the game was finished, the DS version was cancelled due to contractual concerns over putting two licenses in one project and the potential legal mayhem doing so could create.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14405">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/834384-928503_67591_front.jpg</image></root>
