The interface has also been upgraded to a completely mouse-driven 3rd person perspective.  Additionally, the upgraded graphics engine brings new life to the enviroments of Paris, a small town in Mexican, Mayan ruins, and Prague's catacombs. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16965">Syberia</game><game id="1975">Syberia II</game><game id="24312">Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis</game><game id="3970">Myst</game><game id="6515">Return to Mysterious Island</game><game id="13976">Dead Reefs</game><game id="6212">Dark Fall: Lights Out</game><game id="5010">Dark Fall: The Journal</game><game id="4897">The Moment of Silence</game><game id="7967">Riddle of the Sphinx: An Egyptian Adventure</game><game id="29918">Alter Ego</game><game id="3437">Sentinel: Descendants in Time</game><game id="6870">Sherlock Holmes: Secret of the Silver Earring</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/35156/1051692-na_front.jpg</image></root>
