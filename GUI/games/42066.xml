Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin is king, and Shrek and Fiona have never met. Now, it's up to Shrek to undo all he's done in the hopes of saving his friends, restoring his world, and reclaiming his one True Love.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9268-1.jpg</image></root>
