This time around, the developers wanted the player to feel that he is in control of the mall. They added a system in which the player can create stores, with custom merchandise and floors, customize employees to fit the design of the store, and even make custom kiosks with custom functions. This added frustration, customizing stores/kiosks didn't reward the player at all, and most gamers described it as a "distraction" from the main flawed game. Mall Tycoon 3 featured up to 40 different customizable stores, and 5 different mall locations.System RequirementsPentium II processor 800MHz128MB of RAM750MB of hard disk space Direct 3D Video Card (with Direct X 9.0 support)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/923158-55607_forside.jpg</image></root>
