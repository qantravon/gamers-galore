<root><id>19209</id><name>Cybernator</name><description>OverviewCybernator (Assault Suits Valken in Japan) is a side scrolling mech combat game from Konami. The player plays as Jake Brain, a soldier in the Pacific States Marine Corps and a pilot of a hulking assault suit, on a mission to destroy the Axis.GameplayThe game has a number of features that characterize it and separate it from other side scrolling platformers of the day. There is a detailed aiming system, with multiple degrees possible, more than the standard up/down/diagonals in most shooters. The suit also has a limited jump/flight capacity, giving a sense of weight to the player's movements and making it important to consider the environment. There are also special stages, where the player is tasked to fly at speed through asteroids, or maneuver through the Earth's atmosphere on re-entry.The game has two endings, good and bad, achieved through completing or failing a majority of the side missions in the game respectively.Release DifferencesThe game was edited for its US localization, a notable scene where the leader of the enemy forces commits suicide being censored, and other details like character portraits being removed from in game conversations.Critical ReceptionWhen released, the SNES version was given the scores of 8,8,8,8 and an Editor's Choice Gold Award from Electronic Gaming Monthly. They added, "...the soundtrack is really kickin', and it's easy to get lost in the beat. Graphically it uses astounding detail and colors. The Mode 7explosions need work however, and the control is a little choppy at first".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15559">Metal Warriors</game><game id="12475">Target Earth</game><game id="1371">First Samurai</game><game id="30781">X-Kaliber 2097</game><game id="31791">Night Slave</game><game id="34568">Genocide 2</game><game id="34570">Soukou Kihei Votoms: The Battling Road</game><game id="7265">Front Mission: Gun Hazard</game><game id="40646">Kisou Ryouhei Gunhound EX</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363713-snes_cybernator.jpg</image></root>
