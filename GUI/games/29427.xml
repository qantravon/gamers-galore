It is a DSiware game and features four-player Royal Rumble-style fighting gameplay similar to Power Stone. The title is humorously and intentionally misspelled.4 player ad-hoc multiplayer will also be supported. Rachel, Noel, Ragna, Jin and Taokaka are the only confirmed characters, however the full game has been released on the Japanese DSiWare marketplace.The game also uses " Chibi" (small cute) versions of the characters which seem to be a less serious approach to the BlazBlue universe.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20100">Power Stone</game><game id="3712">Power Stone 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1456038-img.jpg</image></root>
