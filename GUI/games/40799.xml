Instead, the player collects treasures while avoiding enemies, like a tail-less snake. The player has access to a boost function that she can use in to avoid and repel enemies. After collecting a certain number of treasures the player proceeds to the next stage, which continues until he is hit enough times to run out of lives, ending the session.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/17/174250/2384537-screenshot_a7xpg.png</image></root>
