<root><id>40069</id><name>American Dad vs. Family Guy: Kung-Fu II Turbo! Hyper-Mega Edition</name><description>The game includes the main cast of both the American Dad and Family Guy TV shows. Some characters are dressed in gag costumes or have some modification to fight better (such as Stewie in a MechWarrior mecha and Klaus in a floating WWI contraption). Stan, Hayley, and Chris are the only characters that retain their appearances wholesale from their standard appearances in the show.Ryu from Street Fighter II is the final boss and a playable character, his sprites ripped from that game and modified slightly to fit into this one.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2345533-adkf.png</image></root>
