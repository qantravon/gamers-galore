<root><id>26134</id><name>Castlevania</name><description>OverviewThis new, unnamed Castlevania title originally announced at TGS 2008 is being developed for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 platforms.  While it is certain that Alucard will appear in the game, and that it takes place after Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, little else is known about the title.  The current state of the game's development is unknown, as it was a no-show at E3 2009.  Instead, Konami chose to unveil Castlevania:  Lords of Shadow, highlighting Kojima Productions head Hideo Kojima's involvement in a supervisory role with no mention of involvement from longtime Castlevania lead Koji Igarashi, whose team was developing the unnamed Castlevania title.  It remains to be seen if this particular Castlevania will see the light of day, or if it was cancelled in favor of Lords of Shadow.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10460/965246-ps360_alucard_face.jpg</image></root>
