After a daring rescue, Marty and Doc have no choice but to go back to 1931 and stop young Emmett from being in a relationship with Edna and set him on the track to see the film, "Frankenstein," which took Doc down the path of science that would eventually lead him to inventing the time machine. However, Marty's plan will ultimately put his friendship with Doc to the ultimate test.PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS: XP Service Pack 3 / Vista / Windows 7Processor: 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalentMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 256 MB RAMDirectX®: Direct X 9.0cHard Drive: 2 GB Space FreeSound: Direct X 8.1 sound deviceRecommended:OS: XP Service Pack 3 / Vista / Windows 7Processor: 2.7 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalentMemory: 3 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 512 MB RAMDirectX®: Direct X 9.0cHard Drive: 3 GB Space FreeSound: Direct X 8.1 sound deviceMac System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Snow Leopard (10.5.8)Processor: 2.0 GHz Pentium or equivalentMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 256 MB RAMHard Drive: 2 GB Space FreeNot recommended for MAC Minis or early-generation MacBooksRecommended:OS: Snow Leopard (10.5.8)Processor: 2.3 GHz Pentium or equivalentMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or NVidia card w/ 512 MB RAMHard Drive: 2 GB Space FreeNot recommended for MAC Minis or early-generation MacBooks</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30008">Sam &amp; Max Episode 301: The Penal Zone</game><game id="21670">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 1: Fright of the Bumblebees</game><game id="20587">Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner</game><game id="6049">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</game><game id="25467">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 2: The Last Resort</game><game id="25468">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 3: Muzzled</game><game id="25469">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 4: The Bogey Man</game><game id="26776">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal</game><game id="26777">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 2: The Siege of Spinner Cay</game><game id="26778">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 3: Lair of the Leviathan</game><game id="26779">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 4: The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood</game><game id="26780">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 5: Rise of the Pirate God</game><game id="32796">Tales of Monkey Island</game><game id="38889">Back to the Future: The Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/86881/2145319-game_back_to_the_future_episode_4_double_visions.png</image></root>
