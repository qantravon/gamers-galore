It casts the player as either a "one man SWAT team" working for the Tokyo police, or an American police officer of the LAPD, working to take down members of the Gokudo-kai (極道会), an internationally based yakuza group.Unlike earlier light gun games, the game was unique for its motion sensing technology, sensing body movement rather than requiring the player to move individual controls; the player's "real world" actions are reflected by the player character within the game. In addition to dodging, it also featured a unique cover system, where the player takes cover by physically ducking for cover rather than pressing a button. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15867">Time Crisis</game><game id="40769">Gunslinger Stratos</game><game id="30164">2 Spicy</game><game id="30322">Dragon Ball Z V.R.V.S</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/329/1425252-police247_cover.jpg</image></root>
