From creative director Jeremiah Slaczka, this auto-run "micro-platformer" will feature levels that are only one screen wide. The player must tap the screen in order to jump while the kangaroo on screen automatically runs across the level. The game features 420 levels which are divided into chapters. These levels will be released in 10 level increments every week, which will not require a product update.The player will encounter new gameplay elements such as double jumps, fans, spikes and platforms that can be destroyed as they progress through each chapter. Upon completing one level on "Normal", the player then unlocks the same level on the "Extreme" difficulty.Creative director Slaczka noted that the inspiration from Run Roo Run came from a Flash game developed by Chris Jeff, Space is Key.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36260">Jetpack Joyride</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2270/2099694-runroorun1.jpg</image></root>
