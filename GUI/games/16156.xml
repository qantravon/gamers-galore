It features Earth in its 26th (and final) century with a large schism between the Jovian Detention Authority (JDA), its bubble-encased cities containing inhabitants who were willing to bend to the will of the dictatorial JDA, and the Sprawlers, those inhabitants left behind outside the protection of the cities to face the excessively polluted wasteland due to their unwillingness to submit to the JDA. The game implemented a 3D engine, although most aspects of fighting were not affected by the terrain and were still fought in the traditional 2 dimensions of land strategy; a few units, however, would move faster when going downhill and slower when going uphill. While the graphics were good for when it was released, it was generally written off by critics as a clone of other successful franchises, such as Command  Conquer.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="615">Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3</game><game id="2068">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</game><game id="3594">Total Annihilation</game><game id="12651">Ground Control</game><game id="2070">Army Men RTS</game><game id="22012">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm</game><game id="19932">Emperor: Battle for Dune</game><game id="27130">Command &amp; Conquer 4:  Tiberian Twilight</game><game id="5921">M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration</game><game id="39722">Tryst</game><game id="5817">WarGames: Defcon 1</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4656/1059144-2779.jpg</image></root>
