Or so our Otti-infant imagines as he follows the trail of sweets that will lead him to his abducted parent. It's a trail of peril and adventure--- terrifying toys, a blood-chilling basement and an office of hi-tech horror."  TriviaThe Ottifant is a creation of German comedian and actor Otto Waalkes. The name is a portmanteau of Waalkes' nickname Otti and the German word for elephant.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/142/1198334-the_ottifants__front_eur_pal_.jpg</image></root>
