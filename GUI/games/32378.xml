Players will find themselves looking for gold caches, building unit-spawning buildings, and rallying their forces against their enemies. The player's "hero" character is still just as customizable as in many other action-rpgs. The hero levels up, gains spells or skills, uses potions, and finds new armor and weapons.  Enemies   Fyrd Battlemaster                          Vile Thorn                  Torturer                  Shield Breaker                  Shaman                  Scavenger                    Poisonous Locustus                   Hive Dweller</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13091">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</game><game id="12107">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II</game><game id="5985">Diablo</game><game id="20803">Diablo III</game><game id="1119">Diablo II</game><game id="25983">Torchlight</game><game id="32255">Torchlight II</game><game id="8638">Titan Quest</game><game id="30191">Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</game><game id="13217">Champions of Norrath</game><game id="3156">Champions: Return to Arms</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/46575/1470507-game_cover.jpg</image></root>
