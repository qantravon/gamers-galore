This mainly involves helping them upgrade their homes.When a house is first built it is in the form of a small hovel, by giving the occupant access to resources such as water and food the hovel will be upgraded. To get the highest level of house the occupants must be provided with things like entertainment and medicine.By upgrading the houses the occupants will pay more in tax thereby increasing your ability to expand the city.TechnologyThere are more than 70 technologies to research in the game. They are mostly familiar to players of civilization. Each technology provides bonuses to the city such as Forestry which increases the amount of wood harvested by workers. ResourcesThere are many different resources and commodities in the game. Some of them, such as water, are basic and only need a single building to gather. Others such as bread are more complicated to produce. Production of these more complicated commodities involves several buildings working together. As an example, to produce bread a wheat farm must produce wheat which is delivered to a mill to produce flour and then sent to a bakery where the final product is turned out. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="995">1701 A.D.</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="15262">Imperium Romanum</game><game id="6724">1602 A.D.</game><game id="8760">1503 A.D.: The New World</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="2859">Cultures: Die Saga</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="2815">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="4820">Dungeon Keeper 2</game><game id="32175">Dungeon Keeper 3</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="31820">Majesty 2: Pocket Kingdom</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="24980">Grand Ages: Rome</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/186916-932339_74173_front.jpg</image></root>
