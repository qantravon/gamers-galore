He must maintain order on Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, as well as discover the truth behind his sister's mysterious death.   Slater controls a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft called the Havoc, which he'll pilot during the game's varied missions. Some missions require the gun-ship to drop bombs on enemies below while others are straightforward dogfighting sessions. Other mission objectives include escorting ally ground units, preventing smuggling, bomb disposal, and scanning for suspect vehicles. There are 35 missions in total, as well as a bonus training mode.G-Police is heavily inspired by the science-fiction film  Blade Runner.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4830">Colony Wars</game><game id="9495">Killing Cloud</game><game id="12340">Skyhammer</game><game id="7272">Adrenix</game><game id="43948">Rapid Assault</game><game id="8237">Helicops</game><game id="8398">Crime Cities</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/776561-gpolice_front.png</image></root>
