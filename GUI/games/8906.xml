So, the more bees that land the less space you have to shoot. You can get rid of the bees and the honeycombs with the bug-spray. Leaving the honeycombs is useful because after the hummingbird collects from them, this gives you more bug-spray. However, leaving the honeycombs makes the bees land faster. If the bees cover the bottom of the screen with flowers or if you run out of bug-spray then you lose.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1157">Centipede</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366948-intv_buzzbombers_none.jpg</image></root>
