By 2002 though, the game was no longer being distributed in any capacity, both mail-order or online.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="499">Tyrian</game><game id="16693">Raiden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3564/386758-rotmsbod_04.jpg</image></root>
