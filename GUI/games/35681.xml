Each level includes use of various gameplay mechanics which are introduced to the player as the game progresses. These levels are accompanied by a haunting, accordion-heavy soundtrack to enhance the experience. At E3 2011, the stage demo demonstrated a level which required the player to shift the ground in order to create slopes; and another level which required moving Petit through the air by dragging hanging tendrils onto him. Chillingo stated other mechanics in later levels would include portals and air pockets. Although mainly black and white, there will be collectibles in each level which unlock in-game bonuses.LevelsAt E3 2011, Chillingo announced there would 60 levels across three worlds in the full version of the game when it is released in July 2011.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35361">Bumpy Road</game><game id="20647">World of Goo</game><game id="33651">Cut the Rope: Holiday Gift</game><game id="30380">Limbo</game><game id="37262">Deadlight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2334963-contre.png</image></root>
