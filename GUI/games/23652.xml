Unlike the expansion pack, X-Tension, which was almost entirely an open-world, X2: The Threat has a clear background story involving an aggressive alien race known as the Khaak. However, the game remains open-ended and the players are free to pursue the plot at their own pace, if at all. X2: The Threat continues the steep learning curve of the previous games.  Plot As the game begins you take the roll Julian Gardna, a pirate attempting to steal a ship with his friend Bert Serra. You are quickly caught by the Argon Police, but are spared prison due to the intervention of Ban Danna the head of Argon Secret Service. Instead you face rehabilitation and end up working for Ban Danna after receiving your first ship.  The plot continues as you search for your father and face the Khaak threat.  System RequirementsOS: Windows 98SE/ME/NT/2000/XPProcessor: Pentium III 800 MHz (or equivalent) minimum.
