It was Capcom's first foray into the role-playing genre. The game was mostly well-received by critics, but was critized for its linear story progression and frequent random enemy encounters.Capcom later released a GBA remake in 2001 that included some minor additions and tweaks to the game. Among these additions were new character portraits, new additional illustrated cutscenes, the ability to dash, and tweaks to the overall difficulty of the game. Players could also swap items between their inventories with the use of a game link cable.StorySpurned by the evil goddess Tyr, the Light Dragon Clan and the Dark Dragon Clan had been at war for aeons, destroying the land they once governed together. Out of the war-torn people arose a young hero and his seven companions. On a treacherous journey, they managed to capture Mila and seal her away in a dungeon locked with six keys. A fragile peace has since returned to the lands as the Light Dragons work to resolve differences with the Dark Dragons.
