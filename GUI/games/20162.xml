The Smith family (Allen, Laurel, and their daughter Charlotte) each have their specific field of expertise: Allen is an amateur inventor, Laurel an expert gardener, and Charlotte an entomologist with a cute insect-eating pet spider. With all their powers combined, you manage different defensive towers made from gun-toting garden gnomes, seed-shooting sunflowers, web-shooting spiders, and more!DevelopmentGarden Defense took approximately 9 months to create. It released in November 2007 to high critical acclaim within casual game circles. It was praised for its humor, inventiveness, and ways of incorporating hardcore gaming tropes found in tower defense games at the time for the casual game market.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/123700/1700281-5771.gif</image></root>
