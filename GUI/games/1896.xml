<root><id>1896</id><name>Tetris</name><description>OverviewA screenshot from the MS-DOS version of Tetris.Tetris was originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, who designed and programmed the game in June 1985 while working in the USSR at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science in Moscow. The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra," which means "four," and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.GameplayTetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.Tetris VariantsA number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.IP RightsThe rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.TriviaTetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.Nintendo also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest liscensed Tetris arcade machine.Tetris Giant</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1072">Dr. Mario 64</game><game id="20681">Poker Smash</game><game id="1916">Puyo Puyo</game><game id="14264">Wetrix</game><game id="5057">Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</game><game id="2582">Wario's Woods</game><game id="14873">Kirby's Avalanche</game><game id="21935">WildSnake</game><game id="17641">Dr. Mario</game><game id="21680">Trism</game><game id="5845">Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</game><game id="21701">Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness</game><game id="14116">Tetris Worlds</game><game id="17985">Hatris</game><game id="11890">T-Tris</game><game id="12987">Mermaids of Atlantis: The Riddle of The Magic Bubble</game><game id="21354">Tetris Elements</game><game id="5182">Geom Cube</game><game id="16966">Yoshi's Cookie</game><game id="16455">Klax</game><game id="13943">Pac-Attack</game><game id="10515">Magical Tetris Challenge</game><game id="2755">Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</game><game id="23076">Sonic Eraser</game><game id="9736">TetriNET</game><game id="23337">Tris</game><game id="1601">Lumines II</game><game id="23597">Dizzy Panic!</game><game id="15464">Polarium Advance</game><game id="23694">Lumines Supernova</game><game id="20609">Piyotama</game><game id="7647">Acid Drop</game><game id="18228">Tail Tale</game><game id="10430">Magic Boxes</game><game id="5604">Die TÃ¼rme von Hanoi</game><game id="24052">Trash Panic</game><game id="12246">Pusher</game><game id="24872">Topple</game><game id="5770">Kentris</game><game id="3012">Pyramid</game><game id="14883">Fourfit</game><game id="25561">Topple 2</game><game id="10628">Kirby's Star Stacker</game><game id="14989">Amazing Tater</game><game id="19197">Yoshi</game><game id="26045">Witch's Workshop</game><game id="26140">Altar of Gems</game><game id="18287">Hexic</game><game id="4938">Zoop</game><game id="11179">Tetroid 2012</game><game id="28182">Kubes</game><game id="22805">Lights Out</game><game id="29086">Unify</game><game id="29384">City Rain</game><game id="26412">Critter Crunch</game><game id="11442">Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</game><game id="9436">Audiosurf</game><game id="30899">Aqua Rush</game><game id="31017">Trioncube</game><game id="7562">Alexey's Dwice</game><game id="25868">Roogoo Attack</game><game id="1271">Columns Crown</game><game id="29108">Columns II: The Voyage Through Time</game><game id="31279">Metris II</game><game id="31408">Metris</game><game id="31432">Metris 3</game><game id="31444">Metris 4</game><game id="31140">Tetris Party Deluxe</game><game id="31588">Metris 5</game><game id="31962">Cruxade</game><game id="22518">Block Out</game><game id="25711">Magnetis</game><game id="30060">Art Of Balance</game><game id="33455">Blokus</game><game id="30474">Slam Bolt Scrappers</game><game id="9151">Edtris 2600</game><game id="15177">Fisher-Price: Perfect Fit</game><game id="34863">Trouble Zone</game><game id="14466">Triptych</game><game id="4757">Egaint</game><game id="35309">Falling Block</game><game id="6921">Disney's Timon &amp; Pumbaa's Jungle Games</game><game id="35429">Blocks That Matter</game><game id="36592">Noite Animal</game><game id="37076">Not Tetris 2</game><game id="37282">Puzzlejuice</game><game id="37052">SpellTower</game><game id="2578">Blocks from Hell</game><game id="33007">Cleopatra Fortune</game><game id="38415">Slydris</game><game id="32678">Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy</game><game id="28366">Mystery Circle</game><game id="17432">Floatris</game><game id="6117">Gorby's Pipeline</game><game id="40890">Jelly Allstars</game><game id="41009">Bloxeed</game><game id="42073">Starseed Pilgrim</game><game id="42958">Clocks</game><game id="43452">Block Buster</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362306-nes_tetris.jpg</image></root>
