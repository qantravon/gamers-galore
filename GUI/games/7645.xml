The square can never stop, unless it collides with a wall or another player's trail. The game starts out with four players on the same screen. Players move around the screen trying to eliminate the others by causing them to collide with trails or walls.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20883">Tron</game><game id="10357">Armagetron</game><game id="24569">Snake360</game><game id="30048">Jungler</game><game id="16028">Surround</game><game id="17246">TimeSplitters 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366983-intv_snafu_au.jpg</image></root>
