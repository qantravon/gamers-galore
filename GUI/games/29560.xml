<root><id>29560</id><name>Stronghold Kingdoms</name><description>GameplayGameplay is different than previous Stronghold titles in the series, however the same principles will apply. First you must collect resources such as wood, food, and stone. These tasks, of course, must be assigned to workers which will spend their lives continually harvesting your goods. Your Kingdom must then store these resources in a granary or stockpile. These resources must then be used by Fletchers, Poleturners, and Blacksmiths to produce weapons which are given to your units. Gameplay becomes more complicated as taxation, honor, and morale are added to the mix. However, as opposed to the other Stronghold games, in this game the castle you build will be yours for eternity, or until it is destroyed by a siege.System RequirementsOS: Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista SP1 or Windows 7 (Windows Update Recommended)Processor: 1GHz or FasterMemory: 512Mb RAM for Windows XP (1GB for Windows Vista  7)Hard Disk Space: 150 Mb of Hard Drive SpaceVideo Card: DirectX 9 Compatible Graphics Card</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2388330-kingdoms.jpg</image></root>
