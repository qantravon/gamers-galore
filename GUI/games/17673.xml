The fling piees are shaped like those of Tetris, only on a flat plane, and represent the three zones of SimCity (residential, commercial, and industrial). The player must also build roadways so these zones may grow. There are also special zones that must be placed and filled so the player may have special buildings such as police stations, parks, and junk yards. The game has a disaster phase which consists of  focusing on an icon and pressing the action button/left mouse button until the didsaster goes away. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/387/224944-simscarniva.jpg</image></root>
