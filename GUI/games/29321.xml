According to Ubisoft's official press release:Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is the next chapter in the fan-favourite Sands of Time universe. Visiting his brotherâ€™s kingdom following his adventure in Azad, the Prince finds the royal palace under siege from a mighty army bent on its destruction.The Prince will be visiting his brothers Royal Palace.The game for the 360, PS3, and PC versions takes place between Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, giving insight on how the Prince turned from a charming young rogue to an emotionally unstable murderer.The Wii version takes place with the Prince being lead by the Genie Zahra, who is making claims that she can give the Prince a kingdom and princess if he follows her. Once they arrive to the spot where the kingdom was to be, the Prince sees nothing and feels cheated. Zahra tells him to kiss a statue in the middle of the clearing and once he does, he is able to see what Zahra sees, which is the kingdom of Izdihar. The Prince soon realizes that the kingdom is in poor condition, but manages to find a sword stuck in stone. After pulling it out, he accidently frees a women and a beast named Homa. While searching for the beast, Zahra tells the Prince that the genies once lived in Izdihar, but were all killed by the Haoma. In effect, the Wii version is a prequel to the other console versions because as the Prince leaves the ruins of Izdihar, he heads to his brother's kingdom to begin the next part of the Forgotten Sands storyline.Although its release window deliberately coincides with the release of the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time movie, the storyline of The Forgotten Sands has nothing to do with that of the film.GameplayThe use of the series' trademark time-rewinding mechanics is present, and some new powers have been included, such as allowing the Prince to influence the elements of nature, including earth, water, wind, fire and ice. Several of your elemental powers allow you to control aspects crucial in puzzle solving. For example, the Prince is able to perform an air dash, allowing him to cross long distances. His ability to stop water from flowing allows him to traverse it in unique ways.For the Wii version the game concentrates on small groups of enemies that are more vicious and attack more frequently, creating an atmosphere more akin to the previous Prince of Persia games than the other version of The Forgotten Sands. While in combat, the Prince makes use of his blade with the Wii Remote and hands through the use of the Nunchuk. All of the other moves that the Prince uses for are controlled through the buttons. There are no elemental powers that the Prince can use for this version for the game. Instead the Prince uses an object called the "Sand Ring" which freezes enemies in their place for a limited amount of time.A brand new combat system has been designed, which is said to benefit from the Anvil engine's capability to show countless NPCs at once on the screen, displaying as many as 50 enemies at once on the screen.Various VersionsThe PS3, Xbox 360, and PC versions of the game were developed by Ubisoft Montreal and offer a traditional Prince of Persia experience, using the technology that powered the 2008 game and the Assassin's Creed series of games.The DS, PSP,and Wii versions of the game were Ubisoft Quebec City, and offer a "different experience from the more powerful systems."
