<root><id>24871</id><name>Fieldrunners</name><description>OverviewFieldrunners is a simple tower defense game. Starting a game allows you to select mode, difficulty(easy, medium, hard), and map. The three modes are classic, extended, and endless, classic uses only 4 towers and will end after 100 rounds. Both extended and endless allow use of 6 towers. The only difference between them is that extended ends after 100 rounds. There are currently five maps available. It is good to know that on Crosslands, enemies always go toward the opposite exit from where they entered, so place your towers and make a path accordingly. Land units will always follow the shortest path to their exit which allows Juggling. Air units will fly straight across all defenses to the exit, so it is important to place a lot of heavier damage turrets closer to the middle of the map.Fieldrunners was initially released for the iPhone, but overtime additional platforms came available.TowersEach tower can be upgraded twice for increased damage and range.
