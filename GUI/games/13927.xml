<root><id>13927</id><name>Airport Tycoon 3</name><description>The third installment in the Airport Tycoon series is a major change from the second. It incorperates new ways to build your airport they way you want. Terminals no longer come with pre-determined parking areas for airplanes, you decide how many parking spaces you have and where they are. It also improves on the graphics, buildings and parked aircraft look good, though aircraft landing and taking off just seem to drive across the terrain.  The game is clearly aimed at a niche market and sold what it would finally sell very quickly and become unsupported within only a matter of a year. In the end this game was one of many that spelled the downfall of Global Star Software as an independent publisher causing them to eventually be bought by 2K Games and become 2K Play.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9350">Airlines 2</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="38711">Pocket Planes</game><game id="40273">I Am An Air Traffic Controller: Airport Hero Haneda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15405/831620-airport_tycoon_3_coverart.jpg</image></root>
