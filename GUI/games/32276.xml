In classic        tycoon gameplay, you need to buy all sorts of neat things to decorate your graveyards and burial sites with.       Flowers,      headstones,     fountains,    benches and so forth. Furthermore, you can lay path to the graves to make them more accessible as well as redesign the grounds in other ways, such as chopping down that large tree in our way. Mr. Jones' Graveyard Shift has considerably good graphics for a   budget game and while the  linear gameplay does not make it that repayable, the game finds the right balance between lacking the time to accomplish all your tasks while new challenges (i.e. new customers) pop up to get rid of the beloved and deceased ones. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1460148-mr_jones_graveyard_shift_main.jpg</image></root>
