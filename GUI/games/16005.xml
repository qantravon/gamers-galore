Fred's moves like running, ducking, and powering up his mighty club... look downright ridiculous.  The levels are nice and long, but there needs to be more of them.  In addition, the prehistoric end bosses are very weak".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371432-flintstones_original.jpg</image></root>
