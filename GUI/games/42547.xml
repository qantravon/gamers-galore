The Action comes from dodging anti-virus drones while doing it. It's one of the few puzzle games out there where you can play co-operatively (with up to 3 friends). But if you tire of working together, there is a battle mode where you can take on your friends to see who is the supreme virus.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Puzzle</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17820-1.jpg</image></root>
