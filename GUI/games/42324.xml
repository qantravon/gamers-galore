The Gods have given the BUDDIES free reign over these colorful islands for their own willy-nilly, topsy turvy pleasure. But, there is a way to stop them ….FUN is the secret ingredient that will ground the BUDDIES and return gravity to Earth.As one of Earth’s last human survivors, it’s up to you to dish out a healthy dose of amusement to restore order on Earth.Do you have what it takes to outwit the BUDDIES and win back the favor of the Gods?</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Adventure</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/15248-1.jpg</image></root>
