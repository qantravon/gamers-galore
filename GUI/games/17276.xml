After training you head out with a squad to take on your adversaries, and the game takes place in a series of small scale scenarios with tactical turn-based combat. You have a number of action points within which to move, fire, reload, take cover etc during your turn. Your characters also level up and increase skills and attributes, and you equip and deploying your squad on later levels. A two-player skirmish mode is played in turn on the same machine, rather than through a link cable.Rebelstar is loosely based on a couple of games of the same name that designer Julian Gollop created for the ZX Spectrum in the early 80sÂ  - they pioneered the turn-based combat system at the time, and brought the world of board-game style strategy to a new audience. Tactical Command is a modern iteration of the gameplay style that Gollop used in those games and developed with Laser Squad and then X-Com. But Gollop publicly acknowledged that this game was highly influenced by other GBA combat and RPG strategy titles - Advance Wars, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8721">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</game><game id="12719">Advance Wars</game><game id="11939">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</game><game id="9659">Panzer Tactics DS</game><game id="5255">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</game><game id="18457">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</game><game id="21163">Luminous Arc 2</game><game id="5534">Luminous Arc</game><game id="21286">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</game><game id="6052">Front Mission</game><game id="24220">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon</game><game id="1520">Fire Emblem</game><game id="1148">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</game><game id="6483">Onimusha Tactics</game><game id="10537">Jagged Alliance</game><game id="12876">Mech Platoon</game><game id="196">X-COM: UFO Defense</game><game id="31771">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</game><game id="20557">Operation Darkness</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2492921-box_rstc.png</image></root>
