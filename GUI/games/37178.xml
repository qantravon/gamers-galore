<root><id>37178</id><name>Lord of Vermilion II</name><description>OverviewLike its                    predecessor, Lord of Vermilion II is a mishmash of light real-time strategy and action RPG. The player's units are summoned by placing the game's proprietary                   collectible cards onto the arcade cabinet's lower sensor screen. Similar to the first game, this screen does offer some additional control over the units, such as being able to alter their attack trajectory by physically rotating the cards.   Lord of Vermilion II has a higher number of guest characters than the previous game, culling from games and franchises like                  Final Fantasy IV,                 Final Fantasy VI,                Final Fantasy IX,               Final Fantasy XI,              Final Fantasy XIV,             Secret of Mana,            Romancing SaGa 2,           Romancing Saga 3,          Valkyrie Profile,         Magic: The Gathering,    The   King of Fighters '98, and       BlazBlue. The game was followed up in 2011 by an expansion entitled Lord of Vermilion Re:2.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31838/2098151-titleimage.jpg</image></root>
