The goal of the game is to defeat Necron an evil sorcerer and also the brother of Hegor.Barbarian was first developed for the Atari ST and released in 1987, along with the Amiga version. The game was also ported and released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and PC (DOS) in 1988.The box cover artwork was done by popular fantasy artist, Roger Dean. He also designed both the Barbarian and Psygnosis logos.GameplayThe game is a third person platformer and uses a rather unique control system. Pushing left and right on the joystick moves Hegor. Pressing 'fire' brings up the command menu at the bottom of the screen. Using up and down scrolls through the commands and once a command is highlighted, pressing 'fire' will perform that action. This control system eliminated the need for extra buttons to play. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14708">Sword Master</game><game id="13611">Castle of Dragon</game><game id="15874">Axe of Rage</game><game id="24227">Champions of Zulula</game><game id="4549">BlackThorne</game><game id="4796">Sword of Sodan</game><game id="10117">Wrath of the Demon</game><game id="8965">Targhan</game><game id="6600">Deathbringer</game><game id="19285">Moonstone: A Hard Days Knight</game><game id="16573">Battle Blaze</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9979/1121009-513px_barbarianpsygnosis.jpg</image></root>
