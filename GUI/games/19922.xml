<root><id>19922</id><name>Supaplex</name><description>Supaplex consists of 111 levels, in which the goal is to reach the exit, but this can only be done when the player has gathered enough Infotrons. This is not easy, however, as the player encounters multiple elements that make it harder to collect the Infotrons, such as Ports (which limit the player's movement to specific directions) and Zonks (Supaplex' equivalent to Boulder Dash's Rocks).Unlike in Boulder Dash, there is no time limit in which the level has to be cleared.The game is now declared freeware.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="2991">Boulder Dash</game><game id="20782">Q*Bert</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game><game id="20315">Igor: The Time Machine</game><game id="23395">New Supaplex</game><game id="2587">Dig Dug</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2185390-supaplex_1.jpg</image></root>
