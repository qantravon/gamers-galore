Along with the original Mystique titles, PlayAround also released a number of their own adult-themed games. These games were released in pairs on special "double-end" cartridges.OverviewThe two games contained in this release are "Beat 'Em  Eat 'Em" and "Lady in Wading".Beat 'Em  Eat 'EmBeat 'Em  Eat 'Em is a re-release of the original game created by Mystique. It features a man at the top of the screen vigorously dispensing his seed to the gaping mouths of two women waiting below. Its paddle-style gameplay is very similar to titles like Kaboom!.Lady in WadingLady in Wading is a re-working of Knight on the Town, another original game created by PlayAround (only with gender roles reversed). Instead of a knight, it features a maiden who must build a bridge across the moat of a castle in order to reach her man in the tower. This may sound easy, but deadly alligators and a really annoying goblin make things increasingly difficult as more of the bridge is built.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12822">Jungle Fever/Knight on the Town</game><game id="14272">Philly Flasher/Cathouse Blues</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/635009-b_beatemeatemladyinwading_back.jpg</image></root>
