Play the likes of the Trade Federation, The Rebel Alliance, The Empire in the Battle of Hoth, the Battle of Yavin or the Battle for Naboo.

In this, the expansion pack for GB, you can now control more then 200 units from the latest Star Wars movie [Episode II: Attack of the Clones], including a wider range of droids for the Trade Federation and, of course, the Clone Army (controlled by the Old Republic).

14 new single player missions, involving the Clone Wars and events from the Original and prequel movies plus the 'Expanded Universe' (i.e. novels, comics, etc) are included, each centered on or around major events, locations and characters in the Star Wars galaxy. And you can throw the whole Clone Army up against the Rebel Alliance if you wish, in either skirmish or multiplayer modes.</description><genres><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/11506-1.jpg</image></root>
