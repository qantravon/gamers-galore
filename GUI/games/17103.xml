<root><id>17103</id><name>Athletic World</name><description>OverviewAthletic World is the first in Bandai's series of Family Trainer games, in which a player uses the Power Pad accessory to simulate the running and jumping sports depicted in the game. The original release of Athletic World in the US had the "Family Fun Fitness" brand attached to it, the original name of the Power Pad accessory - a subsequent rerelease with the Power Pad name (once Nintendo had bought the rights to the device) came shortly thereafter. As with Stadium Events, which underwent a similarly disruptive period involving the rights to the Power Pad, the original release of Athletic World is an extremely rare item for collectors.The game has five events: Hurdles, Hop A Log, Animal Trail, Rafting, and Dark Tunnel. Each required a certain amount of athleticism and dexterity from the player, not to mention stamina.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="42">Track &amp; Field</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361137-nes_athleticworld.jpg</image></root>
