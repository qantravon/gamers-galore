<root><id>16684</id><name>Saturday Night Slam Masters</name><description>OverviewSaturday Night Slam Masters (known in Japan as Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion) is a 2.5D wrestling game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (via the enhanced CPS-1 hardware) on July 13, 1993. The game plays similar to other arcade wrestling games of the time (taking place in a standard wrestling ring where the player has three-dimensional movement of their characters). However, the game includes original international (and colorful) characters, including Mike Haggar from the Final Fight franchise, wrestling to climb the ranks of the fictional Capcom Wrestling Federation (CWF).All versions of the arcade game featured a Single Match (featuring traditional one-on-one matches) mode. Arcade cabinets that supported four players featured a Team Battle Royale mode (featuring two-on-two elimination matches). An updated version of the arcade release (titled Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle in the international version and Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors in the Japanese version) was released on December 1993, removing Single Match mode (focusing on the Team Battle Royale mode) while refining the grappling mechanics, adding new moves (for all characters) and allowing players to select the same character.Saturday Night Slam Masters was ported to the FM Towns Marty (in Japan only) on November 1993, and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis in 1994. While the SNES version was the only version to include Team Battle Royale mode (thanks to multitap accessories), the Genesis version includes an exclusive Death Match mode, which grants more weapons to use, covers the ropes with barbed wire and proximity explosives (making it impossible to bounce off the ropes, but allows players to damage their opponents by throwing them at the ropes), and lays land mines outside the arena.On September 2, 1994, the game received a sequel, titled Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II, which refined it to a traditional fighting game.GameplayThe game controls not unlike a simplified Capcom 2D fighting game, including a single button for attacks, a jump button and a grapple button. Wrestlers can also run against the ropes of the ring, creating a new set of running attacks. Each wrestler featured has one unique special move as well as a finisher they can perform from the grapple once they had depleted their opponents health bar low enough. Once the opponent's health bar is either completely empty, or close to empty, the wrestler can attempt a pin to win or use a submission move to make their opponent quit. Matches can also end with a 20-count ring out.The game features two play modes: Single Match, which featured traditional one-on-one wrestling matches, and Team Battle Royale, which featured two-on-two elimination style matches. In Team Battle Royale, both members of a team have to be pinned or submit for the other team to win. Players could either form a cooperative team, or a single player could have a CPU controlled partner. If playing Team Battle Royale in single player, the match ends in a " No Contest" if the player character is pinned and his CPU controlled partner is not.The game also features the ability to leave the ring. Various weapons can be found that allow you to attack your opponent. The game features no disqualifications for using weapons.CharactersCharacterBioAlexander "The Grater"Alexander "The Grater" (known in the Japanese version as Sheep the Royal) is an American wrestler (Australian in the Japanese version) and butcher (from Kentucky, U.S.A.).He is based on the real life wrestler Big Van Vader.Biff SlamkovichBiff Slamkovich (known in the Japanese version as Aleksey Zalazof) is a Russian wrestler (from Kiev, Ukraine) and the main protagonist of the series.Also known as "The Rocking Ruskie", he is an apprentice of Mike Haggar, and considers fellow apprentice Gunloc as his rival.
