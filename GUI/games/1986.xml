The game is the second, and last game in the Vegas series according to Ubisoft. Some of the most notable additions to the game are an option to sprint, bullet penetration, and a persistent rewards system.PlotThe game starts in 2005, before the events of Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. Playing as Bishop, you take part in a hostage situation during which Rainbow Six member Gabriel Nowak fires prematurely, resulting in the death of a hostage negotiator. This leads to a disgraced Gabriel Nowak being passed over for promotion. The game then jumps to 2010, where Bishop is now leading his squad against Miguel and Alvarez Cabreros, two human traffickers who have expanded into trafficking biological weapons, which leads to a larger plot to attack Las Vegas.GameplaySome of the changes made in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 include the ability to customize your character for both single-player and multiplayer, as well as earn experience points in both. A sprint button has been added, making ducking for cover easier, with the rate of speed and duration of the sprint being based on the amount of armor the player has equipped.Although strategy is required, battles can be intense.Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 keeps its gameplay very similar to the original Vegas. Campaign has been slightly eased down in difficulty, but your objectives will be the similar to what has been seen in Rainbow Six games for years (rescuing hostages, disarming bombs, etc.). A large difference though is that fact that very little of the game takes place in familiar Vegas environments like casinos and flashy streets.Multiplayer adds several new modes like Team Leader and tweaks other mode settings heavily. Attack and Defend now only allows one respawn unlike the unlimited respawns available in the original Rainbow Six: Vegas' Attack and Defend, just to name one heavily changed mode. Co-op play has now been reduced to only two players and two AI companions (both controlled by the host player), but cutscenes and story segments can now be seen in co-op unlike the original Rainbow Six: Vegas. The player who joins in co-op takes the role of Knight, another member of Rainbow Six.The only section of the game that features four player co-op is Terrorist Hunt mode. In this mode, the goal is to find and kill all terrorists in the area within unlimited time or a time limit. Terrorist Hunt can be played both offline and online. In offline mode, the player has the option to go lonewolf or have the two AI companions from the Story join you in the hunt. The maps used are the same maps that are in online multiplayer and haven't been changed or altered in anyway. Depending on the difficulty, you have a limited amount of respawns and must restart the entire map if you fail the mission.Note: The snake cam is only available during Story mode, both solo and co-op.A.C.E.S. SystemRainbow Six: Vegas 2 is taking a page from Call of Duty 4's book and added in a persistent rewards system, but unlike Call of Duty 4 all these unlocks and rankings are used in both single and multiplayer. Called the A.C.E.S. system, which stands for Advanced Combat Enhancement Specialization, it gives you three categories to earn points in: Marksman, Close Quarters, and Assault. Points are earned by doing certain actions that would correspond with a certain play style. For example, pulling off a long-range headshot would net you a marksman point. Gaining points will level you up in a certain category which will then either unlock a weapon or give you an experience bonus. Rewards are staggered so that you will alternate unlocking a weapon or gaining XP for every A.C.E.S. level you advance.AssaultGaining assault points usually relates somehow to using a very aggressive tactics, without worrying about your stealth.Gain assault points byKilling an enemy that is behind cover ( 3 assault points)Kill an enemy using C4 ( 3 assault points)Kill an enemy that is manning a turret ( 2 assault points)Kill an enemy using explosives besides C4 ( 2 assault points)Kill an enemy who is using a riot shield ( 2 assault points)Close Quarter Battle (CQB)As the name suggests, Close Quarter Battle rewards you for getting up close and personal with terrorists.Gain CQB points byKilling an enemy using blind fire ( 3 Close Quarters points)Killing an enemy that is blinded by a flashbang or tear gas grenade ( 3 Close Quarters points)Kill an enemy from behind ( 3 Close Quarters points)Kill an enemy at close range ( 3 Close Quarters points)MarksmanshipMarksmanship is all about pulling off either very difficult shots or very accurate shots.Gain marksman points byKilling an enemy at long range ( 3 marksman points)Killing an enemy that is using a rope ( 3 marksman points)Killing an enemy that is in the act of sprinting ( 2 marksman points)Killing an enemy while you are rappelling ( 2 marksman points)Get a headshot ( 1 marksman point)Vegas 2 also featured a regular ranking system that allows you to unlocked either new clothing, armor, and camouflage patterns for your character. There are 21 ranks that originally shipped with the game, from private second-class to elite, but many more ranks were added in the Gift Pack DLC.DLCIn July, 2008, Ubisoft released a free DLC pack, which they named the Gift Pack. In the pack there were three maps, new gameplay settings, many issues were patched, and new ranks were added. The three new maps were Calypso Casino, CQB Training Dark, and Murdertown Dark. Calypso Casino was the most popular map from Rainbow Six Vegas because of its many pathways and three floors. The two other maps are variants on maps already in Vegas 2. The only change is that both maps are now pitch dark, so visibility is greatly reduced. This makes both maps great for Team Deathmatch and Team Leader games. Eighty new A.C.E.S. levels were also added, which brings the total levels up to 100. There are no extra unlocks for these new A.C.E.S. levels, but each level after 20 will give you 5000 experience points. New ranks were also added beyond the Elite, which gives the highest ranking players something new to work for. A mode called High Stakes was also added that makes the game harder.When activated, High Stakes mode makes these changesNo radar and enemies do not appear on the tactical mapNo grenade indicatorLimited HUDHealth regeneration is disabledCamera view is changed so that you must exposed yourself to look around coverAim Assist is always disabledWhen not in cover or looking down your gun's scope/sights your bullet's accuracy will be decreasedLess ammunition than normal at the start of the gameKill Cam is always disabledFriendly fire is always onThings that were tweaked in a patch contained in the Gift PackIncendiary grenades have a longer delay between throwing and explodingC4 explodes faster after pressing the detonatorSniper rifle damage is slightly increased at longer rangesLight Machine Guns now have better accuracyRate of fire was adjusted for some SMGs, assault rifles, and shotgunsThe time it takes switching between normal view and looking down the scope/iron sights is reducedWeaponsSub-Machine GunsMP5NMP9M11UMP45MP90MP7A1SKORPION VZ83TYPE 05AUG PARALight Machine GunsMK4621EMG36M249 SPWAssault Rifles552 COMMANDOG36CFAMASSCAR-H CQCTAR21M468G3KA4AUG A3AKS-74UM8FNCL85A2AK-47Sniper RiflesSR-25 SDSCOUT TACTICALSV-98M40A1PSG1L96 ARCTIC WARFAREShotguns870MCSSPAS 12XM-26 LSS500 TACTICALM3PistolsP99USP40MK.23DESERT EAGLE92FSG18RAGING BULLArmorCustomize me please!You can customize your character with several types of armor. Each piece of armor has two ratings: Mobility (how fast you can move while wearing it) and Protection (its ability to reduce bullet's damage). Usually the best balance can be found by wearing the medium levels of armor that gave you average mobility and average protection. To increase mobility you can sacrifice a piece of armor on any part of you body, and arms and legs can be outfitted with armor individually or as a pair.
