<root><id>32533</id><name>MotoHeroz</name><description>OverviewRace under water and not get wet.MotoHeroz is quite similar to RedLynx' popular Trials series. Players race, tilt and spin through the air on various obstacle courses and collect coins and other things that make no sense but enhance the complexity. The original WiiWare release of the game does not use motion control other than shaking the sideways Wiimote to get the wheels back on the ground if the vehicle has fallen over.While the game sports the Wi-Fi Pay  Play logo on WiiWare and has a menu option for DLC, such content has never materialized and the game has since been ported to iOS and RedLynx moved on to release Trials Evolution on XBLA.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26923">Trials HD</game><game id="35566">Trials Evolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2233120-motoheroz_website_banner.jpg</image></root>
