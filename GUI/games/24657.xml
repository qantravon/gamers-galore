<root><id>24657</id><name>HacX</name><description>Overview Running on         id Software's        id Tech 1, HacX is a first-person shooter set in the future. The game plays much like other       id Tech 1 games such as      Doom,     Heretic or    Hexen, but was unfortunately rushed out the door before the release of   Quake in 1997. It's also a rare licensed reverse-engineered commercial mod - HacX's developers, Banjo Software, reportedly paid  id Software $5,000 for permission to release the game.   Two of its developers now hold high-profile game industry jobs.                      Iikka "Fingers" Keränen works for                     Valve, with credits on                    HL2: Ep 1                    2 and                  Portal, and                 Kenneth Scott became an art director for                ION Storm and               id Software before moving to              Microsoft Game Studio in August 2008.   Free to PlayThe full version of HacX can be downloaded for free from            the creators' website.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="621">Doom II: Hell on Earth</game><game id="10469">Heretic</game><game id="22548">Hexen</game><game id="10565">Strife</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/1257593-591px_hacx_cover.jpg</image></root>
