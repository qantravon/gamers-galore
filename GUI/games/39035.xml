It is the first game to utilize DICE's Frostbite 3 game engine technology. Battlefield 4 will be available for PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 on October 29th 2013. It will also be available on PlayStation 4 for the console's launch November 15th 2013 (Nov 29th in EU), and the Xbox One at it's launch November 22nd, 2013.GameplayCampaignBattlefield 4's single player campaign takes place six years after the events of Battlefield 3 in the year 2020. Russia and China appear as the opposing factions.MultiplayerBattlefield 4 continues the series tradition of class based multiplayer mechanics with objective driven gameplay. Maps and modes involve both large-scale vehicular warfare, as well as smaller infantry-only scenarios. The revamped Frostbite 3 engine allows for more enhanced destruction and interactive environments. A Spectator Mode has been added if players simply want to watch the action. Players will again have the ability to rent servers to personalize the experience.Levolution"Levolution" refers to the dynamic destruction capable in multiplayer, so called because of the players increased ability to alter  interact with the physical characteristics of the map. This includes small things like being able to open  close doors, ride elevators, shoot out lights, as well as referring to much larger "events." Each map has one major Levolution event that significantly alters the terrain of the map, such as a toppling skyscraper in the map Siege of Shanghai, or a destroyer ship beaching onto an island in Paracel Storm.Commander ModeCommander Mode is back in Battlefield 4Battlefield 4 also sees the return of Commander Mode, last seen in Battlefield 2. In this mode, the player (who does not take up a spot on their team's leaderboard) provides aid to their team through intelligence and offensive support. Additionally, the Commander can select any player on their team and see a picture-in-picture view of that player's screen. This mode can even be played using mobile devices without connecting to the game via console or PC.Commander Mode is available only in Conquest, Rush, and Obliteration game modes.ClassesBattlefield 4 retains the same four classes as the previous game, with a few alterations in available capabilities  gadgets:Assault: Largely the same as before, the assault class carries assault rifles  medical packs, with the option of carrying defibrillators or grenade/smoke launchers.Engineer: The engineer's main weapon class has been changed to PDWs instead of carbines. This class is again the anti-vehicle class, with the ability to carry RPGs and mines.Support: On top of ammo packs, C4, and claymores, the support class also has remote controlled mortars available. They also have an increased ability for suppressive fire than the other classes.Recon: This class now has C4 and claymores available to them, as well as throwable motion sensors (last seen in Bad Company 2.) They also have the new ability to adjust sniper scopes to compensate for distance, known as "zeroing."Game ModesThere are 7 game modes available at launch. Five return from Battlefield 3, with two new modes (Obliteration and Defuse) introduced:ModePlayer Count (X360, PS3)Player Count (XOne, PS4, PC)DescriptionConquest2464The classic Battlefield game mode where teams battle for control of flags on the map, with the team that holds less flags bleeding respawn tickets.Rush2432The staple "attack  defend" game mode, where the attackers try to arm and destroy two MCOM stations in each zone, while the defending team defends them.Team Deathmatch2020Two teams of 10 players face-off to reach the target score of kills in a round.Squad Deathmatch2020Similar to Team Deathmatch, except 4 teams of 5 players each battle each other to reach the target score first.Domination2020Very similar to Conquest, but with smaller teams, smaller maps, and no vehicles. Also, players cannot spawn on flags, capture times are greatly decreased, and ticket bleed rates are greatly increased.Obliteration2432Two teams battle to pick up a bomb that randomly spawns on the map, and then transport that bomb to one of three enemy control points to destroy it. The first team to destroy all three enemy objectives wins.Defuse1010In this 5 vs 5 infantry-only, no respawn mode, teams win by either arming  detonating a single objective (similar to Rush's MCOM station), or eliminating the other 5 players on the opposing team. Players can be revived one time before they are permanently removed from the round. MapsThere will be ten maps available at launch. All game modes are playable on all the maps:DawnbreakerFlood ZoneGolmud RailwayHainan ResortLancang DamOperation LockerParacel StormRogue TransmissionSiege of ShanghaiZavod 311BattlepacksBattlepacks are an additional way to unlock items in multiplayer. They are awarded at set intervals by leveling up both soldiers and weapons. Much like the weapon packs in Mass Effect 3, items granted in Battlepacks are randomized. The items awarded are non-game-changing, cosmetic variants of accessories such as new knives, dog tags, soldier camouflages, weapon/vehicle paints, experience boosts, weapon accessories, and more.Items contained in Battlepacks have three levels of color-coded rarity; Standard (grey), Advanced (white), Superior (blue),  Distinguished (orange).There are three tiers of Battlepacks; Bronze, Silver,  Gold, as well as black Weapon Packs. The Bronze Pack will contain three items: two Standard ones, and one that has a chance of being Advanced. The quantity and rarity of the items increase in the Silver and Gold Packs. The Weapon Pack is aimed specifically at the noted weapon and provides weapon accessories for that weapon.
