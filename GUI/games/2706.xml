The game introduced a unique twist to the system by allowing the player to switch between both protagonists at any time during the game, instead of finishing one protagonist's scenario before playing the other. EVE Burst Error often requires the player to have both protagonists co-operate with each other at various points during the game. The use of multiple perspectives has since been used in a number of later visual novels, such as Fate/stay night (2004), Machi (1998), and 428: In a Blockaded Shibuya (2008). </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1705">Yu-No: Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shoujo</game><game id="4285">Desire</game><game id="38015">Xenon: Mugen no Shitai</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2115498-pcbox.png</image></root>
