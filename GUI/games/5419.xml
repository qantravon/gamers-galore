The game was later ported to the PC in 2001, the PlayStation 2 in 2003, and finally the PSP in 2009. Never 7 is sometimes considered to be the first installment of the Infinity series since the game includes a remake of the "Cure Izumi" scenario from the series' first entry, Infinity. Never 7: The End of Infinity was never officially released in English but a visual novel translation group named Lemnisca Translations released an English patch for the PC version of the game on August 17, 2012.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2508/601616-box_japfront.jpg</image></root>
