Your enemies include ice cubes,   carrots and  Watch out! tomatoes. The game is probably one of the hardest and most frustrating games you can find for the Lynx platform, with enemies popping up instantly and from nowhere, and killing you off. Graphically, the game looks sub-par, even for Atari Lynx standards.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6763/395581-s_kungfood_1.png</image></root>
