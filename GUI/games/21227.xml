<root><id>21227</id><name>Metal Gear Solid</name><description>OverviewReleased with the title Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, in Japan and Asia, the game follows Solid Snakes story as he is brought out of retirement. His mission is to infiltrate the Galuade headquarters, to find out information on the new Metal Gear prototype codenamed "Gander" which they had stolen. The headquarters in which Snake has to infiltrate was formerly know as Outer Haven which makes appearances in other metal gear solid titles. The bosses in the game are known as the members of Black Chamber. Hawk, Owl, Bison and Viper, names that all use the same animal motif as FOXHOUND does in Metal Gear Solid.TimelineMany people assumed this game was a prequel to 1998's Metal Gear Solid, but that is incorrect. In the GBC game, Snake meets Mei Ling for the first time over the Codec. However, he also speaks to her for the first time in the Playstation game, therefore the two games take place in separate continuities. The game does, however, refer to events in Metal Gear 1 and 2, specifically the fortress of Outer Heaven, where Big Boss made his stand. So the Game Boy Color game can be seen as an alternate 'what-if' timeline, where this game takes place at the same time as the Playstation game did, as Snake is brought out of retirement.StoryPulled out of retirement infiltration specialist and ex-Fox-Hound member Solid Snake is sent to Africa under the orders that a new Metal Gear (with the code name Gander) has been hijacked and is being kept in a compound called Galude and guarded by mercenary force Black Chamber under orders by the Gindra Liberation Front 'GLF'.Snake is assisted with known characters such as Colonel Roy.
