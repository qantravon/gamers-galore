The game play is similar to Grand Theft Auto Advance, but the player controls a  Yeti rather than a human gangster.  However, the lack of a map or radar make navigating around the city a frustrating task. The storyline involves a Yeti that moves to the inner city to find a wife and start a family. The player can find a floating newspaper that allows the Yeti to work at one of four different jobs. Each job involves a different mini-game that play similarly to classic arcade games. For example, there is a Frisbee tournament that plays similarly to Discs of Tron. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3527">Grand Theft Auto Advance</game><game id="32435">King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch</game><game id="21100">Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31838/1453111-urbanyeti.jpg</image></root>
