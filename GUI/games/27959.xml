It received a Famicom release around the same time. A couple of years later, Acclaim would publish it for the American NES market.GameplayOthello is a classic variant of Checkers and is also known as Reversi. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23505">Othello</game><game id="6030">Othello</game><game id="13953">OthelloÂ³</game><game id="8747">8088 Othello</game><game id="38246">1500DS Spirits Vol. 4: Reversi</game><game id="38349">Othello Millennium</game><game id="40801">Computer Othello</game><game id="41170">Gomoku Narabe Renju</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364890-fds_othello_jp.jpg</image></root>
