You fight through three decks of the ship against various robots and automatons. Interestingly, this game is played from the third-person side-scrolling perspective, but also periodically from a first-person perspective. When the player hears an alarm, he must teleport to the top of the ship to man the turret against enemy space ships from a first-person perspective.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12222/1356542-cosmo_ranger_07.png</image></root>
