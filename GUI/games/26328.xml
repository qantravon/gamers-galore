Use this new TV calibration utility to see if there are any dead pixels and help calibrate it as the game and movie makers intended it to be. Choose between 3 different categories: Color, pixel and size tests. As a bonus we also included a controller test so you can test if your xbox controller buttons, thumbsticks and rumble motors work as they should.To download the application go to Game Marketplace - Indie Games - All Indie Games - T - TV CalibrationColor calibrationXbox and pc games are usually displayed in full video level range (video levels 0-255) where movies is limited to the levels defined in the BT.601 or BT.709 ranges (video levels 16-235).This tool allows you to configure your TV or monitor for optimal performance given your intended use.1:1 Pixel mappingOne to one pixel mapping means that each pixel send by your Xbox is shown as exactly one pixel on your TV which provides the best visual experience. From a distance the image you look at should be a uniform slight gray color. If you notice any patterns or 'white or black banding' on the screen your TV is most likely scaling the input signal. Some TV’s provide a special option which is often called ‘just-scan’ that will provide a 1:1 pixel mapping.FactsThis tool was originally developed for internal use inside Arcane Labs but was polished off and released to the public so they could benefit from it as well.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="29738">Overscan Sniper HD</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/968087-xboxboxart__37_.jpg</image></root>
