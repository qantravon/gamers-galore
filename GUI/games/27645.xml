It featured gruesome combat where the player must defend himself/herself against rival tribes and dinosaurs. Peter Molyneux and Lionhead Studios scrapped the project on Oct. 22, 2004; "The decision to suspend work on any games project is always a very difficult one, particularly when it is a title with the potential of BC," Lionhead's Peter Molyneux said in the brief announcement. "We hope to revive the project at a later date and will endeavor to assign as many of the team as possible to other Lionhead projects."</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1096788-bc102_96.jpg</image></root>
