Suddenly, a benevolent race of advanced aliens from the planet Akirov step in. They claim to have been observing humanity and have intervened, repaired the environment, and taught us to travel further into space. Sadly the Akirovians were only preparing to take over the Earth. we fought back and eventually drove them back out of our solar system. Our victory was due largely to re-appropriated technology, Heavy D.O.L.L.s (Defensive Offensive Lethal Liberator). Giant, remote controlled, robots used not only for military purposes, but also in any task too dangerous for a human. Now, in 2120, the most desired military rank is that of the top Heavy D.O.L.L. operator.
