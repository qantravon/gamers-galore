The game featured no fouls as well as missiles, land mines, and saws that would effect the game when triggered (stepped on) by any player during the game. The game's only real life NBA player, Bill Laimbeer, licensed his name and likeness because of the fact that he was looked at as a dirty and aggressive player. Some of the modes that the game featured were: single player arcade, two player arcade, and season mode. The robust season mode put the player as the owner of a team where they would add new players to their team by buying them.The game was released on the Amiga and Atari ST in Europe under the name "Future Basketball."</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2632">Mutant League Football</game><game id="8270">Mutant League Hockey</game><game id="8857">Arch Rivals</game><game id="13768">Speedball</game><game id="289">Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</game><game id="19351">DBZ: Dead Ball Zone</game><game id="6694">Michael Jordan:  Chaos in the Windy City</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5961/195433-bill_basket.jpg</image></root>
