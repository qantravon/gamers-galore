They used the superior graphics as the foundation of these attacks. During this time Intellivision was in second place in terms of market share. They continued to internally push the limits of their cartridges and managed to double the memory size of their carts, from 4k to 8k. Intellivision developers felt the Atari pressure and begin to look at their catalog of games and determined they can improve their exisiting games and release them faster then they could develop new games that leveraged this new memory size. It was a no brainer to begin work on their most popular game, Major League Baseball.ImprovementsOne of the first games to be a modified version of a previous released game. The basics of the game remains largely the same. The gameplay has been improved greatly with some minor graphical improvements.GameplayNew one player mode.
