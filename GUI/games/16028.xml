As the player-controlled dots move, they leave a line behind them that cannot be crossed and stays on the field until the round ends. The player must force their opponent to crash into either a line or the stage barriers to score.  Once a player crashes, a point is given to the survivor, the stage resets and the game begins again. The player with the most points wins. Surround, in addition to fellow Atari game Dominos, was the inspiration for the               Light Cycles scene (and subsequent games based on it) from                Disney's cult-classic computer film       Tron, released in 1982. It has also spawned the phone game Snake and the subsequent releases of the same name. Launch GameSurround was a North American launch game for the           Atari 2600 on October 1977.
