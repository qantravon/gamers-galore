<root><id>26798</id><name>Squishy Tank</name><description>Gameplay  Squishy Tank's game play is a familiar mixture of light story mixed with the matching of colored tiles. Once the tiles are cleared, more tiles flow in from the top of the screen, with the speed gradually increasing as the game continues. Crazy and quirky power-ups are randomly distributed to the player as the challenge increases.  There are three other game modes, all of which riff off of the established concepts. After the player beats a section of the game, a short animated cut scene occurs, giving the player an insight into the motivations behind the squishy tank. The player is rewarded for beating time trials with a trio of arcade-style mini games and ways to customize your squishy tank with funky clothes. </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19256">Planet Puzzle League</game><game id="1512">Big Money!
