With twice the amount of official team content in each game, great skill moves and new game modes including Career, Practice and classic Scenarios (plus new clubs added to the line-up), the new Club Football 2005 range will bring players even closer to the heart of the action and the heart of their team.</description><genres><genre>Sports</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9623-1.jpg</image></root>
