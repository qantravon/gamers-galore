If the game looks or sounds familiar it is because it is essentially the same game as Popcap's Zuma - Ballistic's Japanese creators threatened legal proceedings but it is unknown and considered unlikely that these resulted in official court proceedings.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17012">Zuma</game><game id="38088">Bonsai Blast</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1888927-ballistic.jpg</image></root>
