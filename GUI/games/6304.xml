Runners are allowed to perform "hard slides" and punches which can knock the ball out of a fielder's hand while fielders can apply "hard tags". These can be used to build your turbo meter and allows players to become "on fire" which enhances your player's stats and gives them unlimited turbo.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18255">The BIGS</game><game id="20687">MLB Power Pros 2008</game><game id="15449">Backyard Baseball 2001</game><game id="20835">MLB 08: The Show</game><game id="21254">Major League Baseball 2K5</game><game id="2250">Triple Play 98</game><game id="1202">Triple Play 97</game><game id="17271">Triple Play 2002</game><game id="7000">Triple Play 2001</game><game id="9670">Triple Play Baseball</game><game id="14025">Triple Play 2000</game><game id="6736">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</game><game id="5259">Super Baseball 2020</game><game id="25511">The BIGS 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261126-box_mlbsf04.png</image></root>
