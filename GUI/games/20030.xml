As in other Street games, the rules have been tweaked from the standard rules of football to allow more flair and bombast to the game, such as eliminating out-of-bounds. It's notable for adding a couple new features to the series.Gamebreakers - Super moves that have a low chance of failing. Can include passes, tackles, jukes, and jumps.Jumping - NFL Street 3 added the ability to jump off of walls and other objects scattered on the fields.The cover athlete is Chad Johnson (before he had his name legally changed to Ochocinco). Clinton Portis, running back for the Washington Redskins, also shows up in the game's opening cinematic with Chad.Game ModesNFL Street 3 has several game modes to choose from:Standard - Normal street football match.Bank - a competition to achieve the most style points (not necessarily touch downs).Play Elimination - Starting a game grants a player a finite number of plays to use, each of which can be eliminated from the playbook if it gains zero or negative yards. The goal is to eliminate all of the plays of your opponent.Pick-Up Game - Pick teams from all available NFL players, not limited to their team affiliation.Time Attack - Possessions are timed. If the player scores, the remaining time is added to their score.Yards for Points - Points are gained by gaining yardage: 2 points per yard on a run play, 1 point per yard on a pass play. Negative yardage subtracts from your score.FieldsThere are several fields to choose from:Georgia - A scraggy field beneath a highway overpass.

This was vetoed by the NFL to not give the impression that NFL athletes were somehow seen as thugs or prisoners.The Catalina Island field was to be included on the PS2 originally. Later, the decision was made to make it a PSP exclusive field and the art had to take a serious hit to work with PSP limitations.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20711">Madden NFL 09</game><game id="7848">NFL GameDay '99</game><game id="2356">NFL GameDay 2001</game><game id="9640">NFL GameDay 2000</game><game id="3333">NFL GameDay â€˜98</game><game id="20783">NFL Tour</game><game id="20653">NFL Blitz '99</game><game id="29744">Madden NFL 11</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2121651-box_nflstreet3.png</image></root>
