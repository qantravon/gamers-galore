Nuts  Bolts is the fifth game in the franchise, and is the series first console release since 2000. The game was developed by Rare's "Banjo" team, which had reassembled shortly before the completion of Viva Pi√±ata in 2006. Several of the original staff have returned to work on the revival, including designer Gregg Mayles, art director Steve Mayles, and composer Grant Kirkhope (the game is also credited as the last official game soundtrack Grant Kirkhope composed for Rare before moving on to THQ's Big Huge Games).Nuts  Bolts, released on November 11, 2008 for the budget price of US $39.99 and AU$69.95, marks the first time the Banjo-Kazooie franchise has seen an appearance on a non-Nintendo platform (not including two games based on "Grunty's Revenge" released on mobile phones). A demo of the game is available on the Xbox Live Marketplace. After a one-gigabyte download, players can try out the game's vehicle customization and several of the worlds available in the retail product. A special pre-order bonus allowed players to download the Xbox Live Arcade version of the original Banjo-Kazooie for the Nintendo 64. However, due to a shortage of the codes many consumers who made pre-orders of the game were not given the codes (although a few specific retailers did in-fact order codes for consumers to come-in and pick-up prior to release).Users with standard definition televisions were frustrated at the size of in game text, which appeared too small to read comfortably on an SDTV screen. Rare addressed these problems with a patch on December 20, 2008, which removed the old dialog boxes and replaced them with new, easier to read versions, reminiscent of the Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie dialogue boxes. In addition to the easier to read text patch, users are able to make dialog text larger via the title menu.On January 5, 2010, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts  Bolts became available on the Xbox 360's Games on Demand service. It costs $14.99 or 1200 Microsoft Points. Nuts  Bolts requires 5.6 GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.PlotYup, she's back too.Nuts  Bolts takes place eight years after Banjo-Tooie. In a dilapidated Spiral Mountain, Banjo and Kazooie have grown fat and lazy due to an excess of video games and pizza in the absence of the previous games' villain, the witch Gruntilda. Despite being bested three times by Banjo and Kazooie, Gruntilda's own memory of events tells quite a different story, which causes mysterious deity Lord Of Games (L.O.G.) to arrive in Spiral Mountain, where he proceeds to transport the heroes and villain to his own domain, Showdown Town. L.O.G. then forces a final confrontation between the heroes and Gruntilda, putting the deed to Spiral Mountain up as the winner's prize, and the loser being forced to work in L.O.G.'s game factory until the end of time.GameplayNuts  Bolts adheres to a similar setup as previous games in the series, despite the addition of vehicles.Basic ProgressionMuch of the game takes place in the hub world, equivalent to Gruntilda's Lair and the Isle o' Hags in previous titles. Each of the five levels are opened by connecting their game globe to their respective plinth in the town, which then opens a series of doors based on how many jiggies the player has collected at that point. Each door opened provides a different entrance into the same level, similar to the episodic nature of Super Mario 64.Exploration of the town is limited to the abilities Banjo, or Banjo's vehicle, as seen in the previous game's hub worlds.Vehicle CreationBanjo CopterWhile past Banjo-Kazooie games have been traditional 3D platformers, Nuts  Bolts, through the use of the game's vehicle creation mode, has been designed to allow the player a higher degree of choice when attempting to complete the game's various tasks. On top of the previous collectible items such as jiggies and notes, the game's worlds contain a host of vehicle parts available for use in the construction of the vehicles, culminating in a totaling over 1,000 parts. Over the course of the game, the player will be tasked with various challenges that can be solved in a variety of ways, depending on what vehicle the player chooses to create. Upon completion of challenges the player is awarded a ranking that relates to the time taken to complete the challenge, the score attained, or a host of other factors. When the player successfully completes a boss battle with Gruntilda, they will be awarded a key component upgrade to their Showdown Town vehicle, allowing the player access to different areas of Showdown Town.The creation tool gives extensive control over nearly every aspect of the vehicle in the workshop. Blocks of various shapes and sizes can be used to build the chassis, while a wide variety of wheels, treads, engines, propellers, rockets, and wings, allow the player to create vehicles that operate on land, sea, air, or combinations of all three. Every choice the player makes in the workshop will affect the vehicle's handling, speed, ammo amount, fuel capacity, and durability.LevelsShowdown TownShowdown TownThe main hub world that is home to Mumbo's Motors, Humba's blueprints and parts shop, Bottles' tutorials, Gruntilda, and a host of other characters from the past Banjo Games. Here you collect your jiggies from previous quests, collect notes, and find hidden packages containing vehicle parts that can be applied at Mumbo's Motors. This is also one of the few worlds in the game that utilizes banjo's original platforming skills as there are certain areas the Trolley cannot reach.

Banjo's friends and enemies are there to help him log some time in this computer.BanjolandBanjolandBanjoland is an homage to all of Banjo and Kazooie's previous adventures. Everything about the world from the way it is patched together (it consists of bits and pieces of previous levels such as Freezeezy Peak, Gobi's Valley and Clankers Cavern) to even the shape of the level (it is the shape of Banjo's head). The music in this level takes from Freezeezy Peak and Gobi's Valley, depending on where the player is.JiggosseumJiggosseum Main page: JiggosseumThis world is modeled after the ancient roman colosseum and is filled with many physically straining challenges for Banjo to conquer.
