Unlike most traditional platformers, most of the game is spent climbing and swinging on pegs as opposed to simply running and jumping. The controls of DK: King of Swing are rather unique as you use the L and R shoulder buttons to move right and left - the L button corresponds to DK's left hand (pressing it will make DK swing counter-clockwise), and the R button corresponds to DK's right hand (pressing it will make DK swing clockwise).  The plot of the game revolves around retrieving the Jungle Medals that   King K. Rool has stolen.  DK: King of Swing has a more robust sequel,     DK: Jungle Climber for the    Nintendo DS.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19024">DK: Jungle Climber</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2267070-box_dkkos.png</image></root>
