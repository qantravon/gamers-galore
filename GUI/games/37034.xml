<root><id>37034</id><name>Dirt Showdown</name><description>OverviewDirt Showdown represents a shift in gear for the Dirt franchise, leaning towards the arcade action of Destruction Derby or FlatOut. There are three components to Showdown's gameplay: speed, style and destruction. Speed is covered by the race events, style by the Hoonigan events (previously known as Gymkhana events), and destruction by 8 player Destruction Derby-esque arena battles. Showdown's handling is more forgiving than Dirt 3's, in an effort to attract newcomers. Showdown's presentation returns to Dirt 2's, with lasers, fireworks and hordes of spectators screaming over the now-customary dubstep soundtrack.Dirt Showdown is the first title to be released under the Codemasters Racing label, and the first title to use Codemasters' RaceNet functionality - a cross-game online platform similar to Rockstar's Social Club.Showdown is not intended to be a replacement for Dirt 4, but rather a new arcade take on the franchise - in a similar vein to Forza Horizon's development alongside an inevitable Forza 5.MusicThe game features a 46-strong dubstep and rock heavy soundtrack:ArtistSong Name  Featured ArtistsA Loss For WordsThe Hammers FallBlack SpidersCold Dead HandsBlokhe4dHexagonBlokhe4dGHOST IN A VAN V1BreakageFighting Fire (Loadstar Remix)ByobOne Way RoadCamo  KrookedWatch It Burn (Instrumental)CanterburyReady YetDanny ByrdSweet HarmonyDot RottenAre You Not EntertainedEighteen Nightmares at the LuxMother of GirlEqualizersWide AwakeFar Too LoudPlay it loudFar Too LoudWe Want to DanceFelgukThe Funky Drama (FTampa Mix)FreestylersCracks (Ctrl-Z Remix)Grand MagusAt Midnight they'll get wiseKids in GlasshousesAnimals (Hadouken Remix)KuduLet's Finish (Sinden Remix)LostAloneDo You Get What You Pray ForLower Than AtlantisIf The World Was To EndMalleefreshIntuition (Darth  Vader Mix)Max RaptorThe King Is DeadNeelixDisco Decay (Felguk Mix)NeroMe  You (Dirtyphonics Remix)NeroInnocence (Feed Me Remix)Reckless LoveSpeedin'Rise AgainstHelp Is On the WayRise AgainstArchitectsRival SonsGet What's ComingRubicon CrossLocked and Loaded Ruff V1Scott NixonThe MarchSkryptchaRunnin' AwaySouth CentralJapanStanton WarriorsShoot Me DownTempleton PekSignsTempleton PekCall To DisarmThe AnswerPiece by PieceThe Parlor MobInto The SunThe QemistsTake It Back featuring Enter ShikariThe TreatmentDepartedThe TreatmentThe DoctorThe TreatmentShake The MountainTurbowolfRose for the CrowsWe Are The OceanTrouble Is Temporary, Time is TonicWolfgang GartnerIllmerica (Radio Edit)PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows Vista or Windows 7Processor: AMD Athlon 64 x2 or Intel Pentium D @3.2GhzMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: • Graphics: AMD HD2000 Series, Nvidia 8000 Series, Intel HD Graphics 2500, AMD Fusion A4Supported Graphics Cards: AMD HD2000 Series, HD3000 Series, HD4000 Series, HD5000 Series, HD6000 Series, HD7000 Series; Nvidia GeForce 8000 Series, 9000 Series, GTX200 Series, GTX400 Series, GTX500 SeriesDirectX®: 11Hard Drive: 15 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardOther Requirements: Broadband Internet connectionRecommended:OS: Windows Vista or Windows 7 64 bitProcessor: AMD Bulldozer or Intel Core i7Memory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: AMD HD5870 or Nvidia GeForce 470GTXDirectX®: 11Hard Drive:15 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connection</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25961">Blur</game><game id="25523">Split/Second</game><game id="786">Destruction Derby</game><game id="13177">FlatOut</game><game id="8459">Burnout Dominator</game><game id="25512">Clutch</game><game id="37266">Smash 'n' Survive</game><game id="34493">Mayhem</game><game id="32627">Blood Drive</game><game id="31754">Twisted Metal</game><game id="12318">Twisted Metal</game><game id="36993">Project CARS</game><game id="9110">Xpand Rally Xtreme</game><game id="33118">GRID 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2199341-box_dirts.png</image></root>
