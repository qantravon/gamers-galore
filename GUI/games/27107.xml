<root><id>27107</id><name>Viz: The Soft Floppy One</name><description>Viz was directly parodied in an episode of South Park titled "Medicinal Fried Chicken" when Stan Marsh and the other men of South Park irradiate their testicles in order to procure prescriptions for a newly-opened medicinal marijuana dispensary which has moved into the recently closed Kentucky Fried Chicken building. They men bounce around town on their cancerous testes just as Buster Gonad does in Viz, and are even accompanied by the same carnival-esque travel music which appeared in the game.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2245/1062802-viz.jpg</image></root>
