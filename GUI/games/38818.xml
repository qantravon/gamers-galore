It stars an ordinary Texas rancher named Sam who, while on holiday in England, falls into a blue portal and lands somewhere else, known only as Strange, Texas. Here, Sam meets a variety of characters whom he needs to help in order to progress in the game. To do so, he needs to explore the town of Strange, and will be traveling back an forth between Strange and England. The game gets its charm from its unique, colorful graphics, its almost ambient soundtrack, and its quirky sense of humor.One of the more interesting features of The Real Texas is its keyword system, which allows players to type in random one-word commands and subjects that may or may not invoke a new (and possibly important) response from an NPC or environmental object.The game is available via the developer's website and via GOG. The soundtrack is available for free on the website, or as part of the purchase package on GOG.PC System RequirementsMinimumPentium 4 with OpenGL 1.2 graphicsRecommendedIntel Core 2 Duo or better CPUPentium 4 with OpenGL 1.2 graphics1GB RAMNVIDIA or AMD RADEON graphics200MB hard disk spaceFor Linux, please make sure your graphics drivers support OpenGL 1.2 (GeForce, Radeon, and Intel HD should all work.)</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10276">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</game><game id="10012">Ultima VI: The False Prophet</game><game id="27860">3D Dot Game Heroes</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23546/2248100-327af5e0_3701_4571_82cf_6406323aa154.png</image></root>
