In line with other Cryo adventure games, the player gets to explore a historic location while solving a conspiracy planning on destroying  Louis XIV's  Versailles. Talk, solve puzzles and use the items and clues you find as you make your way through a week in the court of the French emperor. Alternatively you can ditch the story alltogether and just explore Versailles on your own. In association with French national institution  Réunion des musées nationaux and Canal + Multimedia,  Cryo Interactive recreated the Parisian palace in pre-rendered 3D panoramas. Using their Omni 3D technology they would later go on to use in their other adventure games. And populated it with about 30 characters modeled after historic figures and portraits. A lot of detail went into the recreation, with over 200 paintings to view, music true to the period, and a database of information about the art, history and people.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18921">Versailles II: Testament of the King</game><game id="12517">China: The Forbidden City</game><game id="3341">Egypt II: The Heliopolis Prophecy</game><game id="4118">Beyond Atlantis</game><game id="10419">Egypt 1156 B.C.: Tomb of the Pharaoh</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/128514/1764655-versailles_cover.jpeg</image></root>
