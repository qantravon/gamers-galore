If there were such a thing as a "Frogger canon," this game, being developed by a completely different team with no connection to Konami, would not be part of it.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11903">Frogger</game><game id="917">Freeway</game><game id="41489">PlayStation Home Arcade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366069-a5200_frogger2.jpg</image></root>
