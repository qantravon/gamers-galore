The levels are bigger, and can take up more screens, so in order to progress, backtracking is common when you miss a certain vital artifact. This makes the game a lot more difficult. Although sometimes very funny, solutions to the puzzles are usually illogical. So keep a walkthrough at hand. The game is fully mouse driven.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12455">Creatures 2: Torture Trouble</game><game id="10422">The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1860/413334-loader_005.png</image></root>
