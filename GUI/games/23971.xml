Its announcement video was only a few seconds long and hardly any other supplemental info had been released about this game. IGN, after analyzing the footage, speculated that Cosmic Walker would be less of an action game and more of a simulation experience akin to the Endless Ocean series.Spaaaaaaaaace!The Astronaut shown in the screenshots and video has a health and air meter and carries what appears to be a gun-shaped tool which is assumed to be for doing repairs. The character also makes use of a grappling hook device and is seen doing space walks outside his space vehicle/station. Since the images and videos shown feature no enemies or other characters, it appears that there was to be no combat in the game and gameplay would mainly feature exploration and repair work.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/904/705704-__bigimage_48e4a0f2be6c4.jpg</image></root>
