<root><id>26178</id><name>Rumble Massage</name><description>OverviewThis "game" was developed by Justin Le Clair to help soothe gamers after many hours of gaming by allowing you to utilize your controllers rumble feature as a massage for the neck or anywhere else you might like it. The only controls are moving the left stick and the buttons to turn the vibration up or down and how long it should vibrate. This game can play up to 4 players all getting their massage at the same time.GameplayWith only 3 different screens there isn't much to talk about but this is actually something you might wanna consider adding just the trial as it can be quite enjoyable and weird all at the same time.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="27120">A Perfect Massage</game><game id="26286">Remote Masseuse</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/966315-xboxboxart.jpg</image></root>
