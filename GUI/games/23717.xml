The alien traverses the airducts and rooms of the spaceship, opening grilles to allow easier access to the crew. The second game is the "Long Game" which has a chestburster erupt from a random crew member's chest, and an android, it too assigned randomly to a member. From there, the player can guess who the android is and put it into hypersleep or eject it through an airlock before it goes mad like Ash in the film and starts killing everybody. At the same time measures must be taken to contain the Alien and get rid of it like in the short game.  The game was favourably received at the time of its release for its resemblace to the movie experience, as well as tense atmosphere composed solely of sound effects.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/634067-1195295010_00.png</image></root>
