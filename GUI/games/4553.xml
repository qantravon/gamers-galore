The game will come to an end when the player runs out of energy.The game can only be played with the special paddle controller that originally came with the game. Neither the game nor the controller were ever released outside of Japan.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/37448/1397762-alex_kidd_bmx_trial_box_art.jpg</image></root>
