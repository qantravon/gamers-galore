The 2003 title puts players in the role of Delta City's cyborg police officer with 6 different weapons to acquire and 9 levels to venture through.GameplayGameplay is like many first-person shooters but with a couple of differences. Players have 3 different enhanced vision modes that can be activated: radar, zoom, and thermographic. Gameplay also supports a felony meter that is located in the game's HUD. When players disobey one of RoboCop's programmed prime directives, such as killing innocent civilians, the felony meter will fill and eventually shut down RoboCop if full. The game also allows players to arrest criminals, an action that can be taken when an enemy surrenders.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="847">Metal Slug</game><game id="22471">Ultimate Stuntman</game><game id="14959">Judge Dredd</game><game id="17939">Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra</game><game id="1713">Doom Troopers: Mutant Chronicles</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285686-box_robocop.png</image></root>
