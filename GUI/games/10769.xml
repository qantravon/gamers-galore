<root><id>10769</id><name>Jurassic War</name><description>Jurassic War is a real-time strategy game that features battles between different tribes of cavemen and prehistoric animals and dinosaurs. The graphics and controls are very similar to those of Warcraft and Dune. In the game, players take control over a number of simple units that can level up and the tribes also have various special units, like magicians. The game features an RPG system, where individual units can gain experience from killing things. Each unit has six bars showing its velocity, its light radius, its magic power, etc, and a general bar that sums up the unit's overall strength. As the units level up, the player can boost individual bars to customize the unit's strengths.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
