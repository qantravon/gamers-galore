From Hydlide there is the real-time combat, which requires that the player character attacks monsters by running into them from an angle in order for the hero's weapon to hit.Minelvaton Saga is the spiritual predecessor to the two Silva Saga games for the Family Computer and Super Famicom. It was never released outside of Japan, but did eventually receive an unofficial fan translation.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game><game id="2363">Hydlide</game><game id="39606">Kalin no Tsurugi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2338380-minelvaton_saga.jpg</image></root>
