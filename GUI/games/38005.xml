This version has been declared by the creators as being a "standalone game."</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42164">Organ Trail: Director's Cut</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2179415-organtrail.jpg</image></root>
