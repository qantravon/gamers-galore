Should Goh choose to accept a contract from one lord against another for whom they have worked on many occasions, the latter will feel personally betrayed and likely request his/her troops hunt down and execute Goh. This can become especially tedious if said lord consistently contracts rival ninja or barbarians to attack Goh's hideout. Failure to fend off these attackers will result in Goh's hard-earned money and items being stolen by the enemy, although successfully remaining hidden and earning an "Invisible" rank at the end of each mission will prevent this from occurring to some extent. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7539">Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven</game><game id="7750">Tenchu: Return from Darkness</game><game id="15282">Tenchu: Fatal Shadows</game><game id="19998">Tenchu: Dark Secret</game><game id="16004">Tenchu: Stealth Assassins</game><game id="15737">Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins</game><game id="21331">Tenchu Z</game><game id="7345">Red Ninja: End of Honor</game><game id="24617">Tenchu: Shadow Assassins</game><game id="36092">Kamiwaza</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20737/762979-shinobido.jpg</image></root>
