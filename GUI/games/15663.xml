You must do this while avoiding security systems, unusually located pits and robots that move back and forth. Each level hasÂ  three floors and multiple ladders that connect them. You can also travel to each floor by using either elevators or escalators. When you travel via elevator, you don't just stand in front of it and wait, but you actually have to press which floor you wish to travel to. (ie: use the keyboard to press 1, 2, or 3.) There are also locked doors that will eventually lead to more paintings. These doors can be only opened by using keys.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4656/940977-585506_38423_front.jpg</image></root>
