Like most management games, Theme Park starts you off with a plot of land that you have to develop. The player can build many things found commonly at an amusement park, such as  roller coasters and Ferris wheels, all of which can attract more customers. Players are able to set prices, hire new staff and generally maintain the plot. The aim of the game is to make the theme park as valuable as possible so that it can be sold and a new plot can be bought some where else in the world. The player then starts to make a new theme park and the process is repeated.The DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="12188">Theme Hospital</game><game id="2236">RollerCoaster Tycoon</game><game id="8793">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Wacky Worlds</game><game id="5625">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</game><game id="11178">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="1001">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked!</game><game id="14131">RollerCoaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes</game><game id="18956">Thrillville</game><game id="3799">The Movies</game><game id="19819">Trailer Park Tycoon</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="33312">Game Dev Story 2</game><game id="2415">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Time Twister</game><game id="37339">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D</game><game id="36763">Prison Architect</game><game id="39130">Jurassic Park: Builder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/298146-theme_park_cover.jpg</image></root>
