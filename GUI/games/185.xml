Backgrounds for the Levels consist of real locations like; Miami Beach, the Sphynx or Sastle Neuschwanstein.   It has 99 levels but once you hit 99 the game jumps back to round 0. The individual levels do actually repeat themselves much earlier.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14250">Rodland</game><game id="4995">Bubble Bobble</game><game id="10764">Rainbow Islands</game><game id="19408">Moai Kun</game><game id="3199">Baby Jack</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/624741-bomb_jack__encore__uk_box_art.jpg</image></root>
