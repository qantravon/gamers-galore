Every time the player jumps, the game switches perspective between the two worlds, one light, one dark. Only in the light world can the player see the platforms, but only in the dark world can the player see the enemies. The objective of the game is to progress towards the right side of the level without dropping to the bottom of the screen or hitting an enemy. Doing either of these things will reset them to the start of the level.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/966825-xboxboxart.jpg</image></root>
