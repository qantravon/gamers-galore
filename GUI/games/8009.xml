The game plays from an isometric top-down view, and uses 3D graphics and backgrounds. This was the first game made that used the ADD 3rd Edition ruleset, and unlike the Infinity Engine games (e.g., Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale) the combat in Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor is turn based.Players start the game by creating a party of up to four characters, chosing from the base DD class set. Wizard, Bard, and Druid were ommited from the game. During the game you can find other NPCs to join your party, and you may have a maximum of six party members at any time.The gameplay is classic dungeon crawling in design, featuring sprawling underground areas, and limited above ground maps as well. There is an almost rediculous amount of loot, magic items, weapons, and armor to find in the game, but your characters are limited in what they can carry by weight, so the player must make somewhat frequent trips out of the dungeons to sell off unwanted items.The level cap in any one class is 16, and characters are allowed to multi class, for a maximum character level of 32.Quests are tracked in a quest log, and the game features a detailed automap that can be edited and marked by the player to ease navigation.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="52">Baldur's Gate</game><game id="10637">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</game><game id="5242">Icewind Dale</game><game id="8890">Icewind Dale II</game><game id="16452">Pool of Radiance</game><game id="34768">Age of Fear: The Undead King</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/1357742-g11145su0w1_1_.jpg</image></root>
