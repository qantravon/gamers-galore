It was later translated and released in English on December 19, 2012 by Petals' Garden and Yuri Project.PlotWhile class representative Shizuku Kirishima has foreign exchange student Eris Shitogi under her wing, a faintly glowing love settles into her heart.However, Shizuku, worried sick thinking her nagging personality landed her on her crush's bad side, actually gets a confession straight to her face from Eris?!Shizuku: "D-D-D-Don't misunderstand! I-I-I don't feel anything at all for you! (etc)"This is the romantic comedy of Shizuku, the tsundere Yamato Nadeshiko, and Eris, the cool, blonde foreign exchange student not afraid to show her feelings, and their flirtatious, madly-in-love-with-each-other yuri relationship.GameplayAs a visual novel, SonoHana 8 is heavy on narrative. It has a linear story line that will occasionally present a choice of two options; but like all the SonoHana titles, the top option is always the right choice to advance the story.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24691">Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/134142/2359248-title.png</image></root>
