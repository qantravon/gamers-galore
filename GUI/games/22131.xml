<root><id>22131</id><name>NHL 2K8</name><description>NHL 2K8 was the final game in the series from Southern California based Kush Games.  The game featured a deep franchise mode, and a brand new right stick deking control, meant to allow more freedom than EA's game. While not necessarily a huge commercial or critical success, many hardcore fans consider NHL 2K8 to be the best game in the series due to its superior control, and goaltender animations.  This was also the first game in the NHL series to support the 2K Reelmaker, which was offered as DLC.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="39">Hockey</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18227">NHL 08</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png</image></root>
