<root><id>29453</id><name>RailWorks</name><description>RailWorks is a      railroad simÂ created by    Kuju which picks up where the       Rail Simulator series leaves off. RailWorks focuses on driving real-world trains along real tracks in a simulated 3D environment. RailWorks is primarily distributed via       Steam, and is (in)famous for having hundreds of dollars (USD) of  downloadable content for whatever interests a player may have such as various types of trains, cars, locations, objects, or routes. This version of the game is now obsolete. All future purchases and owners of Railworks have been moved to      Railworks 2, which has various updates in the user interface, gameplay, and editor.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27397">Railfan: Taiwan High Speed Rail</game><game id="23560">Railfan</game><game id="19087">Microsoft Train Simulator</game><game id="18275">Sid Meier's Railroads!</game><game id="9696">Trainz: Virtual Railroading On Your PC</game><game id="15194">Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004</game><game id="31185">Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006</game><game id="7657">Trainz Railwayz</game><game id="28121">Rail Simulator</game><game id="34721">Trainz Simulator 12</game><game id="32923">Farming Simulator 2011</game><game id="35820">Street Cleaning Simulator</game><game id="27981">Forklift Truck Simulator 2009</game><game id="44011">Train Simulator 2014</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11512/1217650-railworks.jpg</image></root>
