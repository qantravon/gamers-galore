It was created by Russian developer Nival Interactive and released there under the name Allods 2: Master of Souls. It is the sequel to the original game, Rage of Mages.  Rage of Mages II was a fairly similar game to its predecessor, with the focus being on adding new features to the existing RTS/RPG gameplay from the original. An improved interface, better creature AI, as well as the ability to recruit monsters are among the new features of this sequel.  As with the original, the player is represented by a single warrior or mage hero, and you recruit new allies through the campaign to complete various real-time tactical combat missions. There is a multiplayer component where players can bring their characters together in co-op and competitive modes for up to 16 players.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5242">Icewind Dale</game><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/75040/1535047-images.jpg</image></root>
