It was developed by Mark Turmell who was also the lead designer in Smash TV. Other similarities between the two titles lies in the sound. Jon Hey composed the music and Ed Boon supplied some voice work for Total Carnage as they both did for Smash TV. Total Carnage was released across many home consoles along with an arcade release.PlotAckhboob's mutant factoryThe year is 1999 and there is a world war. The war is against an evil country ruled by General Ackhboob, and he has closed his country from the rest of the world. Reporters find that he is hiding a Baby Milk Factory, but as they dig deeper this is not the truth. The factory is actually manufacturing an army of mutants that could help Ackboob take over the world. The United States sends in only two soldiers, named Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, to stop Ackboob's evil plan. They are tasked in destroying hordes of mutant troops, rescue hostages and defeating Genral Ackhoob.GameplayMutant bosses are big and ugly.Total Carnage is a bloody shooter that plays from a overhead perspective.
