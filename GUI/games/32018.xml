<root><id>32018</id><name>States &amp; Capitals</name><description>This game was released in cassette format for the Atari 400/800 series of machines and could be booted from an Atari 410 tape recorder. Like most Atari tapes of the era, one side loaded the game straightaway, while the other played a short audio file during loading detailing basic instructions for playing the game. The audio-enabled side of the tape also took longer to load than its silent counterpart.  When the game begins, a state is outlined on the map. You are asked to identify the state, and then its capital. Your scores for correct states and capitals are kept separately.  States  Capitals was programmed by Bob Polaro, who would later go on to make similar games that emcompass world geography, rather than just the United States.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4960">States and Capitals</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/1426070-states_and_capitals_atari.gif</image></root>
