The game is based loosely upon the 1955 animated short, Rabbit Rampage, where Bugs is similarly placed at the mercy of an antagonistic animator attempting to annoy and upset him.    Levels   Following a traditional action platformer gameplay mechanic, each level is themed around a distinct Looney Tunes cartoon, with the enemies and environments representative of the source material.   Level 1.1 Pitting Bugs against his traditional enemy, Elmer Fudd and his hunting dogs, the first level is reminiscent of many classic Looney Tunes cartoons. Taking place in a snowy forest, Bugs must defeat Elmer and his hunting dogs to continue unscathed.Level 2.1 Taking place in a saloon bar, this level is based upon the cartoon Drip-Along      Daffy. As Bugs attempts to navigate the saloon to approach Nasty Canasta, he must dodge barmen sliding beers down counter-tops, TNT barrels and holes in the floor.Level 400 Based on the animated short Bully for Bugs, Bugs is placed in a bull-fighting ring and must square off against Toro the Bull. By dodging the bull's charges and making it run into conveniently-placed targets around the arena, Bugs is able to defeat Toro and proceed.Level 1.3 Based around the Bewitched Bunny short, Bugs finds himself in a medieval witches house, being attacked by Witch Hazel and her army of Gingerbread Men. Witch Hazel's magic transforms Bugs into a variety of classic Looney Tunes characters. After successfully evading Witch Hazel, Hansel and Gretel, the Three Little Pigs and The Big Bad Wolf, Bugs is forced to square off against Yosemite Sam, riding a dragon in his full knight costume from the animated short Knighty Knight Bugs.Level 2001 Taking place in space on board martian spaceships, Bugs is forced to square off against Instant Martians with Shrink guns,fighting against Marvin the Martian.Level 9.1 Taking place in Tasmania, Bugs must square off against native-Australian animal, the Tasmanian Devil.

If Bugs touches one, bad luck (in the form of falling piano's) occurs. If Bugs is able to hit one of the many cats with a paintbrush pickup, Pepe Le Pew will show up and remove the cat. At various points in the level, Sylvester appears riding a train Is this trip really      necessary?
