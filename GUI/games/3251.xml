After their initial defeat they strike again against a weakened Earth - this time from the deep sea. X-Com: Terror From the Deep is similar in most respects to its predecessor. This is certainly the case of its interface, the base building, the missions, etc. Most of the game is set underwater; However, certain missions are land-based, and occur whenever there's been an alien attack on a port or a city. A Lovecraftian horror theme is present throughout the game.The game was initially released for PC in 1995 and was ported to the PlayStation and 3DO a year later. The game was later made available on Steam on May 4, 2007 via the use of Dosbox.PC System requirementsOperating System: Microsoft XP/VistaCPU: 33MHz 386Memory: 4MB.Hard Drive: 520kb free disk space.Peripheral: Mouse</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="884">Jagged Alliance 2</game><game id="646">Laser Squad</game><game id="8894">Freedom Force vs The 3rd Reich</game><game id="18455">Rebelstar</game><game id="18650">UFO: Afterlight</game><game id="6346">Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</game><game id="14005">Pathway to Glory</game><game id="1802">Abomination: The Nemesis Project</game><game id="14444">Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate</game><game id="30865">Xenonauts</game><game id="1379">UFO:Extraterrestrials</game><game id="10537">Jagged Alliance</game><game id="37183">UFO 2: Extraterrestrials - Shadows over Earth</game><game id="38418">UFO Online: Fight For Earth</game><game id="26505">Frozen Synapse</game><game id="37072">Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2344266-terror.png</image></root>
