<root><id>35705</id><name>Alley Cat</name><description>A simplistic screen-by-screen platformer. You control a cat, moving through 2D representations of alleyways. The goal is to move from left to right, avoiding obstacles such as flying cans and jumping bottles and leaping over gaps in the wall. Bonus points are awarded according to how fast you reach the right side of the screen. Upon reaching the last screen, you meet another cat; touching it retains your score and places you back on the first level.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9968">Alley Cat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5312/275874-alley_cat_01.gif</image></root>
