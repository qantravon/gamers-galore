The game features 2 tables, neither of which are replicas of the much revered actual Kiss pinball table, "Netherworld" and "Last Stop Oblivion". Most players will be surprised to find that the tables are 2-D and look like they would have held their own in a 16 bit environment. Another thing that will surprise players is the unusual lack of any licensed music during gameplay. The game does offer the ability to use your own music, in the PlayStation version you actually remove the game disk and insert an audio cd.Kiss Pinball does offer the usual pinball staples, raised lanes, extra balls, letters to light up and a simulated LED display that tracks scores and informs players of bonuses and remaining balls.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14033">Extreme Pinball</game><game id="8569">KISS: Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child</game><game id="22540">Powershot Pinball Constructor</game><game id="14881">Balls of Steel</game><game id="14091">Addiction Pinball</game><game id="25562">Mystery Mansion Pinball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9261/364814-kiss.jpg</image></root>
