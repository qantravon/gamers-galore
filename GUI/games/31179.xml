Like previous Lego Creator games Lego Creator: Harry Potter allows players to place Lego models and characters in pre-created environments. The game lets players build in      Hogwarts Castle, Hogwarts Grounds,     Diagon Alley, Platform Nine and Three Quarters and some additional areas that can be built onto the world. Platform Nine and Three Quarters includes a working version of the Hogwarts Express which players can build a track for. Players can also change the weather in the game between fair, snowy, rainy and foggy and make characters cast spells. A mini-figure editor is included in the game which lets players create their own Lego characters which they can place into the game world.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11395">LEGO Land</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/1362005-lego_creator_hp.jpg</image></root>
