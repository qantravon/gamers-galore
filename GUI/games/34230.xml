To help defend himself, Stanley is carrying an umbrella and wearing a pith helmet to deflect some of the projectiles. However, each time he takes a hit one of these objects will disappear. These defenses can be regained when the player reaches scores of 500 and 1500 points. As the game continues, Coco will get angrier and angrier and start to speed up his attacks until eventually poor 'ol Stanley takes one on the noggin and gets knocked out.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18220">Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em</game><game id="27306">Helmet</game><game id="9094">Kaboom!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6182/1713612-coconuts.jpg</image></root>
