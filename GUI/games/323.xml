The game isn't an exact emulation of the show as, unlike in the TV show, you have only a limited amount of time to answer each question. One area in which the game does follow the TV version is that the game is one player only. There is a two player mode, but the only time both players are playing simultaneously is during the fastest finger/qualifying question.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3330">Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire</game><game id="4449">Deal or No Deal</game><game id="10750">Wheel of Fortune: Family Edition</game><game id="25031">1 vs 100</game><game id="36747">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?
