Atlus released the game in North America on August 23, 2011. Taking place in a fictionalized Tokyo, it combines turn-based Japanese role-playing elements (i.e. from traditional Shin Megami Tensei games) with turn-based tactical elements (i.e. from games such as Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics) while emphasizing the recruitment of demons as battle allies and the fusing of said demons to create new ones.
