In addition to the tank-based combat of the first game, puzzle elements were added (a change that was not universally welcomed). The experimental Raven II tank can be fitted with various upgrades to help you in your travels.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3276">Battlezone</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/1393113-nova_9_a_front.jpg</image></root>
