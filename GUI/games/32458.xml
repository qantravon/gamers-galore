<root><id>32458</id><name>OMG: Our Manic Game</name><description>OMG is a scrolling shooter released on Windows Phone 7. The game auto-fires, leaving players to navigate their ship around with one finger on the touchscreen. Most enemies start out slow and relatively harmless, but also won't earn you many points for killing them. By touching enemies via the touchscreen, you can agitate them, causing them to fire more bullets. Enemy bullets translate into score when the firing enemy is killed, creating a risk vs. reward system.  The game can be played in an "endless" mode where you'll lose when you run out of lives or a timed mode where you never run out of ships but only play for five minutes.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8272/1791051-omg__our_manic_game1804.png</image></root>
