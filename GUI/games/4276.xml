Players control the usual characters on a journey to solve the murder mystery of Mr. Body. The game uses images, videos, and dialog to help flesh out the cast and add flavor to the players' suggestions and accusations. It also has the major advantage of taking care of the confidential case file cards by itself, eliminating the presence of that one cheating player we all know and hate.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22128">Sleuth</game><game id="30111">Disney Guilty Party</game><game id="9595">Scotland Yard</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370462-genesis_clue.jpg</image></root>
