It is played from a sidescrolling 2D-perspective, like a platformer. Dana can push the blocks of ice if they are not connected to an edge, and can also climb on top of them. Dana can only create a block of ice in front of, and one tile below, where he is standing. The only interaction Dana has is the ability to climb up ledges and create, remove and push around blocks of ice. There is no jump button.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12019">Magic Pockets</game><game id="14773">James Pond: Underwater Agent</game><game id="3253">Jim Power in "Mutant Planet"</game><game id="32993">Arctopia</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361734-nes_firenice.jpg</image></root>
