Shredder and the Foot Clan fight to retain the borough of New York through five levels of action.Critical ReceptionWhen released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 8,8,8,7, stating, "...There are a few things missing from the SNES version that made is so good. You can't hurl enemies towards the screen and the game play has less to offer in terms of moves...This game is also far too easy in the 2 player mode".</description><genres><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5428">X-Men</game><game id="19944">Disney's Aladdin</game><game id="22857">Battletoads</game><game id="18034">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time</game><game id="24997">Eduardo the Samurai Toaster</game><game id="19860">Battletoads in Battlemaniacs</game><game id="29491">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389531-genesis_tmnthyperstoneheist.jpg</image></root>
