Max is controlled in typical side-scrolling fashion, but the twist is the ability to draw things to help Max progress through levels. Puzzles include drawing a giant ball with which to launch Max off a catapult, drawing bridges for Max to cross chasms, and more. The player defeats enemies by drawing objects over their heads to crush them.iOS PortThe game was recently ported to iOS platforms, including iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. These versions differ from other versions in that the game's levels have been split up into more, smaller levels ideal for on-the-go gaming. In this version, Max is controlled using virtual buttons, while the marker is controlled simply by dragging your finger on the screen.Windows Phone 7 PortOn October 16, 2010 a port of the game was released on the Windows Phone 7 platform. This version of Max  the Magic Marker added Xbox Live functionality such as achievements and leaderboards. This version of the game was originally released for $4.99.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7Processor: 1.6GHzMemory: 512 MBGraphics: 64 MBDirectXÂ®: 9.0cHard Drive: 400 MBSound: DirectX 9 compatible soundcardOther Requirements: NoneMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or laterProcessor: Intel Core DuoMemory: 1 GBGraphics: 64 MBHard Drive: 500 MB</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6282">Drawn to Life</game><game id="30209">Super Scribblenauts</game><game id="38470">ichi</game><game id="37944">Monster Island</game><game id="41940">Max: The Curse of Brotherhood</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1899/1155545-maxposter.jpg</image></root>
