<root><id>6505</id><name>Unlimited SaGa</name><description>The ninth main entry in the SaGa series, released by Squaresoft in 2002. Like previous SaGa games, the game is non-linear and open-ended, but unlike previous games, its gameplay resembles that of a table-top RPG.ReceptionFamitsu gave Unlimited SaGa decent scores: (8/8/8/7) or 31/40.Western critics, on the other hand, panned the game for the overly confusing gameplay mechanics even though they praised the soundtrack and art style. Despite this, the game has developed a small yet loyal following that likes the game for the same reasons others did not. Because of this, Unlimited SaGa can be considered a cult classic like previous games in the series.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11237">Final Fantasy X</game><game id="8985">Final Fantasy X-2</game><game id="32536">SaGa 3: Jikou no Hasha</game><game id="38393">Crimson Shroud</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2193305-box_usaga.png</image></root>
