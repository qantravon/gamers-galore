<root><id>37564</id><name>1000 Amps</name><description>Overview1000 Amps is an action/platformer developed and published by Brandon Brizzi for the PC and Mac platforms.GameplayIn 1000 Amps, the main character is a robot named Plug, tasked with rebooting the electric tree and defeating a mysterious Intruder. The tree is divided into multiple rooms, each of which has power nodes. Plug lights up a power node by touching it. Each lit power node in a room charges Plug, letting him jump higher  use his teleport. If Plug lights every power node in a room, it stays fully charged. If he leaves before lighting every power node, the room goes dark again. You can go through a room without fully charging it, but you often need the high jump from the charge to traverse the room or reach a room above it.Plug's teleport lets him warp to any empty spot in the room if at least one power node is lit, but unless the room is fully charged, he also darkens anything adjacent to him when he teleports. This often forces him to find spots to teleport from away from the power nodes.The rooms are set up in a large map spreading out from a central node, similar to Metroid or Castlevania if they had puzzles instead of combat. Several upgrades await Plug at the end of each branch, and he'll need them all to defeat the Intruder.LinksOfficial websitePC System Requirements:OS: Windows XPProcessor: 2 GHzMemory: 256 MBHard Disk Space: 6 MBAdditional: Flash Player 10Mac System Requirements:OS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: Intel 2 GHzMemory: 256 MBHard Disk Space: 12 MBAdditional: Flash Player 10</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/88377/2134702-header_292x136.jpg</image></root>
