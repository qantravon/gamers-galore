<root><id>5412</id><name>Darius+</name><description>OverviewDarius+ is the home conversion of the arcade game Darius. Darius went up against the big guns of R-Type and Gradius as another side-scrolling shoot 'em up with a player-directed power-up system.Though there were a few home conversions, the TurboGrafx-CD version is the closest to Arcade perfect. The same version could also be played on the SuperGrafx and had special features that would enhance the experience when played on that system in particular - similar to how certain Game Boy games would be enhanced when used with the Super Game Boy peripheral. Darius+ shares this bonus aspect with its much rarer sister product Darius Alpha.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12266">Arrow Flash</game><game id="3007">R-Type Delta</game><game id="3458">R-Type III: The Third Lightning</game><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="11296">Steel Empire</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game><game id="3219">The Rocketeer</game><game id="15250">Dead Moon</game><game id="32798">A Shooter</game><game id="20222">Soldier Blade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8153/1108387-darius.jpg</image></root>
