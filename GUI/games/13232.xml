<root><id>13232</id><name>City Connection</name><description>OverviewCity Connection has one or two players (taking turns) driving through a total of five different cities. The five levels resemble New York (USA), Paris (France), Neuschwanstein (Germany), Egyptian temples and a lakeside area.GameplayAs you traverse each stage, the road behind you turns white as you paint it, to show where you've driven. Several obstacles attempt to stop you such as police cars, cats and spike strips. Once you paint all blocks in a level, you move on. Randomly red balloons will appear, if the player grabs three in the same level, it will warp you ahead a few levels and give you bonus points. Even if you end up back in New York, the difficulty will stay the same as the level you warped from.MusicEach level has its own musical track, although they all resemble "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso" from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.RootsCity Connection's general gameplay is similar to Miner 2049er which was released on several platforms including the Apple II, Atari 2600 and 5200, Commodore 64 and ColecoVision. In that game you must fully investigate mines.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14533">Miner 2049er</game><game id="15176">Car-Vup</game><game id="14223">Amidar</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5911/833043-161_1.jpg</image></root>
