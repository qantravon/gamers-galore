The arcade machines will include a camera for taking photos of players' faces, which can then be edited with Nintendo-themed imagery, a feature that's a staple of the Mario Kart Arcade GP series. New to the series are the gliders and the underwater racing that debuted in Mario Kart 7, the previous entry in the franchise.Mario Kart: Arcade GP DX debuted at the 2013 Japan Amusement Expo which took place from the 15th of February to the 16th.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="38173">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16324/2428040-91.png</image></root>
