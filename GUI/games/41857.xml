<root><id>41857</id><name>APB: All Points Bulletin</name><description>APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/2265-1.jpg</image></root>
