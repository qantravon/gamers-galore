The game features Epicenter’s proprietary “Thinking Fire” technology that makes the blazes seem almost alive. Fire not only attacks structures, potential victims and firefighters, but also causes changes to the environments and forces the players to alter their strategies. According to Epicenter’s CCO Bryan Jury the game emphasizes “non-violent, game-integral puzzles that mirror the challenges and on-the-fly choices firefighters actually face,”. Player’s success depends on his mastery of realistic firefighting tools and techniques and on his ability to think and react quickly under pressure.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7892">Firefighter F.D. 18</game><game id="12065">Emergency Rescue: Firefighters</game><game id="12355">Rosco McQueen Firefighter Extreme</game><game id="4982">Fire Fighter</game><game id="12703">Emergency Fire Response</game><game id="7434">Universal Studios Theme Park Adventure</game><game id="26475">Brave Firefighters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2438258-8193ft0azkl._sl1500_.jpg</image></root>
