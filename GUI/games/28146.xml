<root><id>28146</id><name>The Irem Skins Game</name><description>OverviewThe Irem Skins Game, known in Japan as Major Title, is a golf simulation game from Irem that was originally released in the Arcade before being converted to the SNES in the US, Europe and Japan. Due to being an arcade game, the game is focused more on fast play and simplified controls rather than the slower computer-oriented golf sims for the Super Nintendo like True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Links.The player can select between four golf player archetypes which define their skills on the course: the power hitter, the technician, the magician and the all-round player. The game assumes the typical behind-the-golfer perspective while taking a shot, to allow the player to see where the ball is going, and switches to an overhead view once the ball is in flight.</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30465">True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links</game><game id="30540">HAL's Hole In One Golf</game><game id="38171">Masters New: Harukanaru Augusta 3</game><game id="38339">Mecarobot Golf</game><game id="39086">World Masters Golf</game><game id="40040">Super Birdie Rush</game><game id="42832">St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2364197-588662_40386_front.jpg</image></root>
