You start the game out by creating your own fitness profile by choosing things like your gender, weight, height, and then the appearance of your character that you will see onscreen. The game provides you with a fitness journal that aims to keep you on track of your goals, such as recording your diet and daily activities. Aside from the main mode, there is also the 30 day challenge mode (explained below). The game lets you pick from its preset workouts or you can custom create your own workouts by selecting individual exercises and editing their difficulty to create a whole routine.The Accessories:The box comes with two exercising accessories that enhance the experience of the game.
