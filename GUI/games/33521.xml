It is split up into different stages that have a wide variety of enemies trying to stop the player from rescuing Clarisse (the heroine of The Castle of Cagliostro) from a band of kidnappers.It was never released outside of Japan, as it was believed that Lupin III was still relatively unknown to the West. It has since been fan translated.GameplayThe player can switch between three different characters that have unique abilities.Lupin - Has the shortest range out of all three but can use all the gadgets that the player might find.Jigen - Can fire across the entire range and can jump while shooting.Goemon - Only has access to his sword but has the strongest attack power.Regardless of which character the player chooses, it still plays like a side-scrolling platformer while shooting enemies in order to get to the end of the level. Along the way it is possible to pick up body armor, bombs, balloons etc that will assist in staying alive. The player will also find unique NPCs scattered around the stage that will provide info or might try to arrest the player character if they run into the wrong person. Once at the end of a level the player must fight a boss and are able to continue on once this boss is defeated. If the player loses a life, that particular character is captured. They can, however, be recovered if the player is able to find the lost character somewhere in the stage and rescue him.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3353">Rolling Thunder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1663502-lupin_iii_pandora_no_isan.jpg</image></root>
