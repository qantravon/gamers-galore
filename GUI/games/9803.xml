The plot involves an alien invasion and is set under-water. The player utilizes a mouse cursor to point at and shoot approaching enemies. The enemies tend to be rendered on top of the full motion backdrop, the quality of which was impressive for its time. The game received mediocre reviews and is mostly a forgotten relic of the FMV era.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1535/1318539-deadly.jpg</image></root>
