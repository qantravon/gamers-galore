It costs 700 Wii Points.Pop is a relatively simple game that consists of players using their on screen reticule in order to pop colored bubbles as they appear on the screen.  Players are able to link chains of similar colored bubbles in order to obtain a score multiplier that increases as you continue to link the chain together.  Players are penalized with a decrease in their time limit for the level if they miss a bubble with any shot.  They may increase their time limit by shooting smaller bubbles.  Their is some element of strategy involved where you may go for increased time limits or by shooting larger bubbles increased scoring capabilities.  The game also features a multiplayer mode that supports up to 4 players on a single console.  Each players reticule will have a different shape to help players locate their on-screen cursor.  The gameplay is similar to the single player, in that each player is attempting to gain the highest score possible.  This mode also introduces power ups that may either help the player who triggered it or hindering opposing players.  The same penalties apply to single player as they do in multiplayer so players may take advantage of this to further frustrate their opponents. Pop also features an achievement system that rewards players for goals achieved during their play time in both single and multi player play.  Online leaderboards are also present in Pop, taking advantage of the Wii's Wii Connect 24 functionality. </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/176373-header_pop.jpg</image></root>
