The game boasts a large expansive ocean with 100 creatures to "collect" in the players aquarium. When the player is on the boat they can do one of several things, they can check up on seals, dolphins, boobies or penguins hanging around on the boat. The player can change the location of the boat via the steering wheel, the player can also teach one of their dolphin companion tricks by touching a fin/mouth and wiggling the wii-mote at the screen. The player can also check email, skip time, talk to the marine biologist who can't swim or listen to music while staring at the sky. But once the player dives the "endlessnes" begins, the player can go anywhere once they are released down to dive within a certain large perimeter around the boat. They can also dive with a partner [dolphin], draw things with an underwater pen and pet fish. Most of the game IS about petting fish and exploring the sea, every-time you see an area while diving the area is drawn in on your map, while every-time you pet/rub a fish the fish is put as a sticker in a brown book in your cabin. The game also allow 2 players to dive together via Nintendo Wifi.StructureEndelss Ocean although it not being its main focus has a single player mode in which you will be send on various missions that will make you venture the different rich locations that the game has to offer. Most of the mission make you guide tourist who want to see specific fish in the water completing these will earn you new gear.
