Once they have earned a forklift driver's license the game opens up into a series of missions in which crates and pallets/skids need to be unloaded from the backs of trucks of train cars and moved onto the shelves of the warehouse. The game also features a free-play mode—a sort of forkliftin' sandbox—in which players can move crates around without a time limit or objectives.The game features original forklift designs, re-creating the latest in forklift engineering and construction.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28050">Farming Simulator 2008</game><game id="28041">Farming Simulator 2009</game><game id="29272">City Bus Simulator 2010</game><game id="35820">Street Cleaning Simulator</game><game id="34269">Agricultural Simulator 2011: Extended Edition</game><game id="35825">Mining &amp; Tunnelling Simulator</game><game id="29453">RailWorks</game><game id="34885">Garbage Truck Simulator</game><game id="35892">RailWorks 3: Train Simulator 2012</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9896/1119549-forklift.jpg</image></root>
