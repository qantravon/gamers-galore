To progress in the game and solve the mystery, Rosemary's memory needs to be pieced back together. By examining the environment she will recall certain events that are stored as photographs. Placing these correctly in a diary completes lines of text, reveals additional information and changes the environment.  The main action are shown through buttons at the bottom of the screen: look at, walk, talk, listen, smell, take, open/close, dig, hit and put. Hovering over locations in the environment with the mouse cursor reveals a tooltip with the name written in text, indicating that the player can interact with it. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/60173/1477721-rosemary_poster_thumb_175x257_2022.jpg</image></root>
