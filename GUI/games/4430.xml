It was originally developed for the                    Atari 2600 but ported to many other consoles already listed on this page. The name is speculated to mean "Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation".Gameplay   The main objective of the game is to rescue trapped miners. You're equipped with a       heli-pack  allowing you to          fly around the level, as well as a               laser-beam to defend yourself from the game's various enemies (             bats,             snakes,            spiders, etc). You're also equipped with           dynamite, which you can use to kill  enemies or to destroy various walls blocking your way. It's possible to use your laser beam to disintegrate the wall as well without the risk of killing yourself, although it takes longer. There are      magma walls later in the game that kill you if you touch them, making it slightly harder to plant dynamite next to, or navigate through the caverns. When you die, you're returned to the same screen as the one you were just on, costing a life. There is a        power meter on the bottom of the screen that slowly drains indicating a time limit, making later levels fairly difficult due to their length. When the power meter is drained, you lose a life. Later levels often feature a raft the player can use to float across the water unharmed.  H.E.R.O. for Xbox 360 Game RoomH.E.R.O. was included in the June 23rd, 2010 Game Pack release of   Game Room for the  Xbox 360.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10014">Pitfall!</game><game id="27997">Balloon Rescue</game><game id="16456">Fortress Underground</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366079-a5200_hero.jpg</image></root>
