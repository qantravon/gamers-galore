Successfully leaving the Arkanoid stage grants the player one of eight letters that make up a secret message: Once this message has been fully revealed, the player moves onto the next world with four worlds in total.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1502">Adventure Island</game><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2290265-bug_tte_honey_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
