Elc's story eventually intertwines with Arc's story. This is a spin-off that was released in 2002 and is related to  Arc the Lad II, which was released on the PlayStation in 1996.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3691/540733-arc_the_lad___kijin_fukkatsu__j__006_.jpg</image></root>
