However, Peter Wright's home in downtown New York City is not the classic New York of today but instead an Orwellian New York of the year 2044.  One evening as he is drinking heavily, due to the death of his wife and child in a terrorist attack, Peter looks through his peephole into the apartment hall and watches as a SWAT team storms in and drags his neighbor, a journalist named Graham Oswald, off into the night.  To ease his curiosity and help Oswald's wife and family: Peter sets off to discover what has become of Oswald, but the real mystery begins when he learns that Oswald was secretly part of a rebel organization fighting to reveal a shadow government conspiracy.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8759">The Longest Journey</game><game id="23594">Still Life 2</game><game id="3141">Still Life</game><game id="16965">Syberia</game><game id="1975">Syberia II</game><game id="13511">Keepsake</game><game id="235">The Black Mirror</game><game id="4403">Post Mortem</game><game id="8090">Jack the Ripper</game><game id="649">Missing: Since January</game><game id="22111">The Whispered World</game><game id="5010">Dark Fall: The Journal</game><game id="6212">Dark Fall: Lights Out</game><game id="12912">NiBiRu: Age of Secrets</game><game id="10915">Beneath a Steel Sky</game><game id="3437">Sentinel: Descendants in Time</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/35156/1188844-momment.jpg</image></root>
