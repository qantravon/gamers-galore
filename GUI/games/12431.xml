No news, however, if Suikoden II will be arriving on the service. Suikoden II had a limited print run and no reprinting and, therefore, commands a high price on the reselling market.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10896">Vagrant Story</game><game id="43958">Sakura Taisen 1 &amp; 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9253/678850-930093_70304_front.jpg</image></root>
