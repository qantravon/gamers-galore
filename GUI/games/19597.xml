It is also the first game of The Legend of Heroes spin-off series. The game was originally released for the NEC PC-8801 home computer but was quickly ported to various systems including the SNES, Genesis and the Turbografx-CD; the last of which saw the game's only North American release. The game eventually also saw a few re-releases on other consoles, though only in Japan.Unlike the previous Dragon Slayer games, which were all side-scrolling action RPGs, The Legend of Heroes is a far more straightforward turn-based RPG of the Dragon Quest mold. It allowed for a party of up to four characters and had a few modern upgrades, such as allowing the player to distribute stats after a level up, target separate monsters and restart a battle if their party gets wiped out.It received one direct sequel - Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II - before the series would drop the Dragon Slayer prefix and continue as a separate Falcom property.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13964">Ys: Book I &amp; II</game><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2543515-box.png</image></root>
