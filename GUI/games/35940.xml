You can for example take the stealthy route and try to enter through a skylight on the roof, or maybe tackle it head-on and hack the security cameras before blowing up a wall and going in guns blazing.The Swindle has a steampunk aesthetic, and in keeping with that your character has a pair of steampunk gloves, which can be upgraded with the money you have gathered throughout your missions. The upgrades range from faster hacking to double-jumps and telekinesis.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81460/1863888-swindlescreenshot1.png</image></root>
