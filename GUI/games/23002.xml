<root><id>23002</id><name>Alien³: The Gun</name><description>Alien 3: The Gun is very loosely based on the film of the same name, in as much as it features locations, the alien, and the "unidentified man".  Aside from those similarities, this coin-operated arcade unit put players in the shoes of two unnamed United States Colonial Marines.  Starting out aboard the doomed Sulaco from Aliens, the marines make their way to the prison planet of Fiorina "Fury" 161 where a massive breakout of the xenomorphic aliens from the films has been unleashed.  In the film, however, there is only one alien the survivors must fend off which appears several times in the game as a recurring boss fight.  Not only that, but players must also gun down several troops sent from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.  The final boss is an unidentified man, much to the chagrin of Alien fans hoping for an epic battle against an Alien Queen.</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="103">Area 51</game><game id="22180">Maximum Force</game><game id="508">The House of the Dead</game><game id="5207">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</game><game id="16238">Alien Shooter 2</game><game id="26021">Area 51: Site 4</game><game id="27855">Aliens Extermination</game><game id="40593">Space Shadow</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2270/496512-alien_3_the_gun.jpg</image></root>
