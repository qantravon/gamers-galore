<root><id>6285</id><name>Locomotion</name><description>Locomotion is played from a top-down perspective. The many levels in the game consist of various set-ups of railways and stations and the player has to make sure they all arrive at their destination unharmed (i.e. without crashing). At random intervals, stations will start flashing and a train will emerge with a letter on it, indicating what the train's destination is. The player can influence the path of the train(s) by switching around the railways, avoiding crashes and sending the trains to the correct stations.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22680">Air Traffic Chaos</game><game id="31434">Locomotive</game><game id="31508">Locomotive 2</game><game id="31516">Die kleine Lokomotive und ihre Freunde</game><game id="26880">Flight Control</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1232/466555-loco.png</image></root>
