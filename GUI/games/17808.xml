Classic Mode is a port of the original Tetris, with different music and sound-effects. The Game Boy cartridge also has the ability to remember scores because is has a SRAM powered cartridge. The game also has a level editor/maker using a  tUME like editor.Puzzle ModeThe biggest addition to Tetris Plus, the goal is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks  and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and  crushes him.  The ceiling is spiked and slowly lowers every 18 seconds giving you less room to work with. The roof also destroys blocks. The professor enters the level from a door.LocationsMayaKnossos Egypt Angkor Wat Atlantis (Atlantis is unlocked by defeating any of the four locations listed above)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31408">Metris</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/971128-198945_43075_front.jpg</image></root>
