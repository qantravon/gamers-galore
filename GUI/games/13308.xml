The goal is to eliminate incoming colored balls by forming groups of three or more of the same color. The player controlled scarab is loaded with a random color to be shot. Balls will continue to enter the grid until the player has eliminated a pre determined number of them. If a ball makes it into the pyramid, the player loses a life.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20751">Hexic 2</game><game id="17012">Zuma</game><game id="23521">Magnetica Twist</game><game id="20567">Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</game><game id="26115">Monster Eggs II</game><game id="26139">Alchemist</game><game id="27675">StoneLoops! of Jurassica</game><game id="27874">Zuma's Revenge</game><game id="33019">Bejeweled 3</game><game id="38088">Bonsai Blast</game><game id="40772">Tokyo Crash Mobs</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1156/238270-0000003086.800x600.jpg</image></root>
