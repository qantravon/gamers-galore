<root><id>17155</id><name>R-Type DX</name><description>Overview R-Type DX is a compilation of the first two R-Type games released for the Game Boy Color. The game was released in 1999, and was published by Epoch and developed by Bits Studios. R-Type DX actually has six different game modes: R-Type DX (a combined challenge of R-Type and R-Type II), R-Type (both in color and black and white), R-Type II (both in color and black and white), and De Souza (a level creation mode unlocked after completing R-Type DX).  R-Type DX was fairly well-received, garnering scores in the mid to high range. Gameplay  R-Type retains its infamous difficulty.     The game follows the traditional R-Type formula. The player goes from left to right, destroying enemies and collecting weapon upgrades. There are a variety of different types of weapons, each of which is upgraded independently (and picking up a new weapon erases the old one). Additionally, there are power-ups for extra ships (that fire independently) and missiles (which fire vertically).  The six different game modes are fairly similar. R-Type DX is a "challenge mode," combining the color versions of R-Type and R-Type II into one game. R-Type and R-Type II is almost identical in color and black and white, with only minor differences (mostly graphically). De Souza is a level creation mode, where the player can place scenery and enemies in any way.    </description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4252">Last Hope</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game><game id="32798">A Shooter</game><game id="32891">Darius</game><game id="15250">Dead Moon</game><game id="8261">Rendering Ranger: R2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26763/1119764-box_scan011.jpg</image></root>
