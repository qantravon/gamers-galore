Galaxy Fight's engine would later on be used in SunSoft's other fighting game Waku Waku 7. In the game you move around a solar system from planet to planet defeating opponents and finally challenge Felden who serves as the game's final boss. The game uses a four button layout where three buttons are dedicated to different strength of attacks and special moves made by pressing multiple buttons together and the 4th button is solely dedicated to taunt opponents. Unlike many other fighting games of that time Galaxy Fight doesn't have any super bars. The game also have stages that do not have borders allowing the stage to scroll indefinitely.CharactersRolfAlvanKazumaRoomiJuriGunterMusafarG.
