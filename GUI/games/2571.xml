A group of retarded psychics have the ability to predict crimes with 100% accuracy, and John happily arrests the pre-criminals. At least, that is, until the pre-cops predict that John himself will murder someone he's never heard of before. John is forced to go on the run from his fellow police officers and try to prove that the system has been tampered with.GameplayUse a variety of weaponsMinority Report is primarily an action game, where you shoot and fight any enemy that comes your way. The game features ragdoll physics and multiple ways to kill enemies, which allows players to experiment. You can shoot, brawl, and throw your enemies around in very many ways.
