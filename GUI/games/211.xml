The game has a series of elemental dungeons, where the player can acquire one of four elemental spirits needed to progress through the game. These can be upgraded through finding hidden "spirit gems" in the world, often using the corresponding spirit to find it.The Return of the PrinceIn Beyond Oasis, you play as the ever resourceful, Prince Ali.

As the face disappears, the cave begins to shake and crumble. Ali swiftly makes his way back to the boat and escapes, and the island sinks below the ocean. Ali arrives at the shores of Oasis.Ali is in pretty good physical condition, and is able to preform various combat techniques, most of which involve flips and spins. He can also sprint for an unlimited amount of time.The MapOasisThe Map is used throughout the player's adventures to check the current location and itinerary. While the world is open, the player may only go to certain places through certain quests, revolving around one of the four spirits and beyond.

A pitcher of water will summon Dytto, a lantern will summon Efreet, a mirror will summon Shade, and a plant pot will summon Bow.Genesis CollectionBeyond Oasis recently appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though Beyond Oasis was called The Story of Thor in other parts of the world (including Europe), the European "Mega Drive Ultimate Collection" version still contains an emulated version of "Beyond Oasis", even when the menu still says "The Story of Thor". This is easily understandable, as there is no reason to emulate a separate version of a game that is identical. The same applies to all of the box art for the games, which are all North American.Freeing Dytto earns a 20G AchievementSoundtrack  TriviaThe game's soundtrack is provided by Yuzo Koshiro and his studio Ancient, and an early demo of the game's song 'Concentration' can be found on the Streets of Rage 3 soundtrack, which he also contributed to. Strangely, Ancient ported over most of the sound library from Streets of Rage 3 and while they can be found in the cartridge data, hardly any of them are used besides the item pickup/eat food sound.System RequirementsOS: Windows® XP or higherProcessor: Intel Pentium 2.0 GHzMemory: 2GBGraphics: 32MB or greater graphics cardDirectX®: DirectX® 9.0 or greaterHard Drive: 50MB free disc space</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10276">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</game><game id="4499">EGG: Elemental Gimmick Gear</game><game id="20150">Shining Wisdom</game><game id="18766">Dark Savior</game><game id="7763">Crusader of Centy</game><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game><game id="16241">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</game><game id="8004">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</game><game id="5895">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons</game><game id="8881">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</game><game id="3645">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</game><game id="13920">Light Crusader</game><game id="1320">Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal</game><game id="32942">Brave Prove</game><game id="5570">Alundra</game><game id="35064">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past &amp; Four Swords</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2369737-genesis_beyondoasis.jpg</image></root>
