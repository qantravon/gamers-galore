The goal of the game is to make 100 million yen (approximately $1.3mil) in the stock market in the span of a single year via a series of shrewd financial decisions and listening to advice about which way a certain type of stock might turn.The game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin.Though it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13426">Wall Street Kid</game><game id="24814">Stock Exchange Kabutore Next</game><game id="35610">Fortune Street</game><game id="21834">Kabushiki Baibai Trainer Kabutore</game><game id="9870">Wall Street Trader 2000</game><game id="11932">Day Trader</game><game id="26966">Wizard of Wall Street</game><game id="8967">Stock Market: The Game</game><game id="40165">The Money Game</game><game id="40640">Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku 2</game><game id="40781">Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2338408-matsumoto_tooru_no_kabushiki_hisshougaku_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
