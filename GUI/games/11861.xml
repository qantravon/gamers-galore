You play as a cop dressed in a red trench coat, who seeks to clear his town of all the criminal scum. The game consists of two parts; one driving-action segment and one sidescrolling-action segment. In the first part you drive around in your red Lamborghini and destroy hostile cars. In the sidescrolling segments, you somersault over gaps, use elevators and shoot lots of enemies until you reach the boss. After having killed or caught the villain, you have go back to your car and drive to the next mission. When the game first came out it drew political controversy for being considered graphic at the time and projecting violent police officers.  You have two types of ammo.  The first is a net, which captures enemies but has a fairly long reload between shots.  The second is a standard pistol.  What made this game controversial is not only that shooting people with the pistol results in blood, but you can shoot kids as well as criminals.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11260">OutRun</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/666491-1071707792_00.gif</image></root>
