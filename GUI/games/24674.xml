The developers are retelling the celebrated, mature story from the popular PC game  The Witcher while also making some key improvements to the mechanics.Geralt of RiviaThe control system has been completely reconfigured from the simple, timed-mouse click mechanic on the PC to giving the player complete control over enemy targeting, attacks, and defensive actions in the console version. The player will be in control over where and when  Geralt parries, dodges, or makes attacks in contrast with the PC version where defense was almost entirely handled automatically by the computer. In general, the goal is to create a much more action oriented combat experience. Along with the new controls, additional motion capturing has been done to supply new animations to these actions.Other changes include revamped boss battles, a new game interface, a handful of new character models, and additional music. Even the character development system has been redesigned with consoles in mind.CancellationIn April of 2009  CD Projekt RED announced that the game had been put on indefinite hold due to complications with  Widescreen  Games, the developer of the game. Eventually  CD Projekt would end their association with  Widescreen Games, stating that they were technically incapable of achieving the quality of game they were hoping for.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3264">Fable</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/30/827540-picture_1.png</image></root>
