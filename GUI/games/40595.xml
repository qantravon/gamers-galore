The game is otherwise a fairly traditional 8-bit RPG, though it does feature uncommon aspects such as being able to see enemies while walking around (as opposed to the then-usual random encounters) and a regularly-proportioned adult protagonist. There is also no overworld map - both the towns and monster-infested wilderness are directly connected.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39833">GeGeGe no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2372385-hyakkiyakou_fc.jpg</image></root>
