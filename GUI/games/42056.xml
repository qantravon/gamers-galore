<root><id>42056</id><name>Beowulf</name><description>As Beowulf, the player fights his way through a number of episodes commanding his band of merry Thanes via a small selection of commands. Beowulf can chant with his band to boost the morale and max out damage out, triggered through a rhythm button mashing mini-game. There are more mini-games similar to the chanting throughout the game. Some appear right in the middle of combat while trying to grapple a large monster similar to sequences in God of War.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9158-1.jpg</image></root>
