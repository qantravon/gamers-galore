Rather than being a space adventurer on an alien world, Animal Attack Gakuen has the player control a schoolgirl as she blasts various evil animals in a bid to rescue her friends.The game was one of the few to incorporate the Famicom 3-D System glasses, which, like this game, were never released outside of Japan. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6036">Space Harrier</game><game id="21800">Planet Harriers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/562629-animal_attack_gakuen_box.jpg</image></root>
