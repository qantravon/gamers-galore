It's highly maneuverable fighter aircraft, equipped with a protective energy shield, a long range scanner, a laser cannon and three homing missiles. Vertical and forward thrust is provided through a single downward-pointing exhaust in the hoverplane's base, so the craft handles rather like a helicopter - tilt the nose down and you fly downward. Also like a helicopter, your hoverplane can be rotated about a vertical axis, allowing it to turn smoothly or swing round on the spot.  Mouse controls take a little getting used to, but Hoverplane maneuvering becomes instinctive after a short while.  Plenty of levels, but though the action is always challenging, it doesn't have a great deal of variety.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2332">Continuum</game><game id="19630">V2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/687828-1159272731_00.png</image></root>
