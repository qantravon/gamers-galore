No specific details on the game have been released. The subtitle, "The Shroud," is also the name of a technology featured in BloodRayne 2 which covered the sky and blotted out the sun, allowing sun-sensitive creatures such as dhampirs and vampires to walk the Earth freely at any time of day, which quickly led to the end of human civilization as we know it.It has been suggested that the reference to the Shroud means that the game will take place after the final cutscene of BloodRayne 2, depicting Rayne as the protector of a community of humans from hungry predators, while also leading a resistance against the vampire's rule of the Earth.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33745/1973129-br_ts.jpeg</image></root>
