<root><id>10131</id><name>Simon</name><description>Re-invented and re-implemented many times since its introduction in 1978, Simon is a simple memory game consisting of four colored buttons, each producing a tone when pressed. To avoid cacophony, these tones form a perfect fourth, fifth, and octave with the tonic. On each turn, the computer generates and plays a random sequence of tones for the player to repeat using the buttons. With each successful repetition the sequence gets longer - ad infinitum, ad nauseum.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39706">Color Sense</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/108953/1828442-simon.jpg</image></root>
