It is no longer possible to access or play it.Saints Row: Total Control was set between the events of Saints Row 2 and Saints Row: The Third, and centered around reclaiming Stillwater from resurfacing gangs in the abscence of the boss. It's very likely this entire bare-bones storyline is completely noncannonical, just because Saints Row: The Third makes no references to losing Stillwater after the events of the second game whatsoever. Add to that the fact that it's a facebook game made by a developer other than Volition, and it's removal from Facebook, and it's pretty clearly just a weird one-off for the franchise that has no connection to future titles.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10593">Grand Theft Auto 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93538/1771690-saints_row_total_control_logo.png</image></root>
