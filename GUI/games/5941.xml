The game features nine levels which are partitioned into three sections, a bottom, middle and top area. Players must smash a wall behind a floating head named Craig which will in turn "Crank it up" which leads the player into the next level. The final boss of the game is the evil Mr. Gore, who can only be defeated by shooting three balls into his mouth.Bonus LevelIf you pass a certain number of challenges on the bottom rung of the table, a launch pad appears which sends you into space where you will pilot a vehicle that has pinball flippers attached to it, and play a version of Pong against an approaching group of skeletons.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11721">Devil's Crush</game><game id="21313">Seikima II - Akuma no Gyakushuu</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370484-genesis_crueball.jpg</image></root>
