It is created by the series' original developer Triumph Studios. Each kingdom's leader is based on an archetypical fantasy RPG character class, such as Rogue, Warlord, or Sorcerer. The choice of the leader's class and race determines their abilities. Gameplay is divided between a strategic world map and tactical battlefields. The map is hexagon-based and resembles the visual presentation of Civilization V. Its release is expected sometime in Autumn 2013.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21978">Master of Magic</game><game id="37248">Warlock: Master of the Arcane</game><game id="3681">Lords of Magic</game><game id="30057">Sid Meier's Civilization V</game><game id="5921">M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/136461/2428284-aow3_logo2.png</image></root>
