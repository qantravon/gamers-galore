The game is a dating sim where you take control of a man and must try to seduce as many woman as possible. This is done through minigames and dialogue trees, despite the fact that the characters don't talk (they emote).Since the game depicts the act of sex (despite not showing any real nudity) as well as substance abuse and gambling, the game was rated M for Mature (or 18 depending on where you bought it). Certain retailers refused to carry the game and those who did had it behind the counter and would only sell it if asked for.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13550">Singles: Flirt Up Your Life!</game><game id="17125">Singles 2: Triple Trouble</game><game id="15448">Playboy: The Mansion</game><game id="17050">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</game><game id="15380">Sexy Beach 3</game><game id="31015">Mojo Master</game><game id="33437">Sexy Beach</game><game id="35450">Sexy Beach Zero</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15405/806745-7_sins.jpg</image></root>
