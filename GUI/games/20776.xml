A variant on the then-popular space shooter genre, the game failed to attract significant interest. Nintendo then developed Donkey Kong and converted unused Radar Scope cabinets into units for the new game. While Donkey Kong proved to be a smash success, Radar Scope has otherwise become a footnote in the company's history.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="2445">Galaxian</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5134/207184-radar_scope_box_art.png</image></root>
