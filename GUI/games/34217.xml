PlotThough the story is never explicitly revealed, the haz-mat suit, destroyed skyscrapers, and theme of eternally falling debris suggest that it takes place immediately after a       nuclear detonation or some other   apocalyptic event inside a major city. ControversyThe Blocks Cometh was originally developed by Halfbot as a free web game, but prior to its official release on iPhone, another game with the same title, same premise, and some identical art assets was already made available on the iTunes store by developer Edison Games.  After an appeal to Apple to remove the intellectual property theft, and an extensive grassroots campaign to raise awareness, the offending game was removed from the iTunes store, allowing Halfbot to release the legitimate iPhone version on February 17th, 2011.  Though several blogs participated in the campaign to raise awareness about the infringement of intellectual property, Halfbot cites Destructoid as one of the most influential, and as a show of thanks, the developer included mascot    Mr. Destructoid in the iPhone version of the game.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/60513/1712221-the_blocks_cometh.png</image></root>
