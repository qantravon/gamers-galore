<root><id>11263</id><name>Galactic Protector</name><description>OverviewGalactic Protector is a spin-off of the Fantasy Zone series, taking the spaceship star of that game Opa Opa and transporting him to space. The goal of the game is to defend the centrally located (and anthropomorphized) planet from a series of alien spacecraft and asteroids. If the planet is hit too many times, the game ends. Each level features a different planet from the Solar System, each with their own characteristics - for instance, Jupiter has a gray mustache.Opa Opa is controlled with a special paddle controller and is fixed in Earth orbit. This creates a defensive Pong-type situation present in games like Atari's Warlords. As with Warlords, the player cannot let anything slip past them too many times.While shooting down enemies, the planet's panicked facial expressions will provide hints as to where the next enemy will appear from.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13984">Tempest</game><game id="34704">Warlords</game><game id="4062">Missile Command</game><game id="11409">Global Defense</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48222/1481602-galacticprotector_sms_jp_front.jpg</image></root>
