Sporting competitive local play, nearly 30 missions and superb balancing, Comet Crash is universally hailed as one of the best of its kind on consoles.Gameplay Despite the twist of playing a tower defense game offensively, the player is consistently forced to strategize defensively in the beginning of each level. Initially outnumbered and outclassed, the player is attacked without rhyme or reason from unpredictable waves of enemies. After creating a respectable defense to hold the enemy at bay, the player must build offensive centers where units will spawn. These units will attack the enemy. Whichever side is destroyed first, loses.Reception  Comet Crash has been received by critics very well and has an impressive  86 Metascore, one of the highest rated PSN games since the service's launch in 2007. Widely noted was the game's quality gameplay yet lack of audiovisual proficiency compared to other Sony-published titles.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12764">PixelJunk Monsters</game><game id="23319">Savage Moon</game><game id="22801">Ninjatown</game><game id="25000">Crystal Defenders</game><game id="22139">Desktop Tower Defense</game><game id="29428">PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe</game><game id="23102">South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!</game><game id="35613">Defenders of Ardania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/947836-comet_crash_685x208.jpg</image></root>
