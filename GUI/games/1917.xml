You control Hugo's character using the directional keys, and and interact with the environment by typing in commands, such as "Pick up pumpkin", "Smash pumpkin" etc. The game was created by          Gray Design Associates, and has three sequels,   Whodunit?,  The Jungle of Doom, and  Nitemare 3-D, which is a retelling of this game's story, except that instead of peacefully solving puzzles to save Penelope, Hugo picks up a gun and blasts his way through an army of ghouls in a first-person shooter.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8664">5 Days a Stranger</game><game id="2037">Maniac Mansion</game><game id="16268">The Black Cauldron</game><game id="17333">7 Days a Skeptic</game><game id="37068">Last Half of Darkness</game><game id="4372">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8960/1717168-hugocover.jpg</image></root>
