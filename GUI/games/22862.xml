Wanda guides Mario while he has various objects over his head (placed there by Wario). If Wanda can guide Mario to the end of the level, Luigi will remove the item from his head. Wanda can also guide Princess Peach and Yoshi, but the only difference is their walking speed. By clicking on things with the SNES Mouse, certain things happen. Wanda can destroy enemies and obstacles, change Mario's direction, and do other things to affect the environment. At the end of each world, Wanda must fight Wario in his plane.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1446">Lemmings</game><game id="1456">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4</game><game id="311">Donkey Kong</game><game id="34779">Splot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/461592-mariowariosfc_boxart.jpg</image></root>
