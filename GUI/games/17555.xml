To progress, players must collect a variety of different items. Levels get more and more challenging as players progress, and they must fight against different monsters to progress. There are fifteen different types of creatures present in the game. The game name looks likely to have been derived from Montezuma, an Aztec king well known from Sid Meier's Civilization franchise.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
