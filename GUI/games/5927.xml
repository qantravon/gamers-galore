<root><id>5927</id><name>TechnoClash</name><description>Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,7,6,6. Danyon Carpenter wrote, "...the combination of magic spells and combat action works well, but the game can become boring and repetitive way too quickly. There is a wide variety of magic spells but it's much too easy to get killed by every enemy on the screen. The backgrounds are nicely detailed but it can be hard to see the enemies. Technoclash is a great idea that should be more refined to make it better".Both Ed Semrad and Mike Wiegard compared the game negatively to Gauntlet.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20517">Gauntlet</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389484-genesis_technoclash.jpg</image></root>
