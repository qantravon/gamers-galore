Gazza II sticks to a scrolling overhead-view, left-to-right pitch like that in Kick Off. Kick power is controlled by holding down fire; the position of the joystick when fire is released determines the type of kick (drive, 90 degrees cross, swerve, chip). When the ball's in the air, pressing fire results in an attempted header. Press fire when the opposition have the ball and your player attempts a slide tackle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15735">Gazza's Super Soccer</game><game id="5626">Kick Off 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1270/645843-gazza_2.jpg</image></root>
