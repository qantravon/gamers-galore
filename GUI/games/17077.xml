<root><id>17077</id><name>Psychosomnium</name><description>Overview Psychosomnium is a freeware short-form indie game produced with the drag and drop software  Game Maker. The game combines difficult platforming, illogical puzzles and a surreal narrative to create a landmark game for indie games, art games and  Masocore games. The game can be freely downloaded  here.Gameplay Psychosomnium is set up like a 2D side-scrolling platformer in which the player must go through different screens to get to the end. Often the screens will contain platforming puzzles that use fuzzy logic as solutions. One example is attempting to backtrack only to be at the other end of the screen and perhaps the other end of an obstacle. Another one is that player death while another character is on the screen results in the player taking control of that character instead.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13735/363925-psychosmnium_site.png</image></root>
