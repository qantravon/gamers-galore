Some new stages were introduced exclusively for this version as well as bonus modes like survival. Since the Street Fighter games have relied on a 6-button pad layout, the overall control was significantly altered on this Game Boy Advance version to only four buttons of weak and strong punches and kicks.CharactersAkumaRyuKenE.

Justin wrote, "...The sprites are very detailed, and show up clearly on the GBA screen, even in less than optimal lighting... Amazingly, gameplay is near perfect, even with only four buttons. It's kind of tough to quickly tap a button for medium attacks, but you get used to it. Quarter-circle and charge specials are pulled off without problem."Reiner wrote, "...it's just as amazing as any of the SNES SF ports. The bonus options add some replay value, but as a while, this fine release is purely nostalgic."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="11813">Guilty Gear</game><game id="15408">Rival Schools: United by Fate</game><game id="8521">SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1791312-box_ssf2tr.png</image></root>
