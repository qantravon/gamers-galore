<root><id>22146</id><name>Journey: The Quest Begins</name><description>OverviewJourney is a fantasy adventure game by veteran text adventure author Marc Blank. It was the final game released by Infocom as an independent studio before being shuttered by owner Activision.The player leads a Tolkien-esque party of four characters on a quest to seek out a reclusive wizard. Most of the story is told through prose text and static illustrations. However, unlike Infocom's classic games, a text parser was not used. Instead players selected actions from a menu system. Each of the four party members (Praxix the wizard, Esher the healer, Bergon the carpenter, and Tag the merchant) can be controlled separately, and each will have different reactions when asked to examine or interact with things. The text throughout the game is actually Tag's journal, written from his point of view in the past tense.Journey was originally intended as the first in a trilogy.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/736433-7067_boxshot_journey___the_quest_begins.jpg</image></root>
