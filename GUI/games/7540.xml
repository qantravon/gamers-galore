It received a 2004 release on the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and PC.The players featured on the cover of the game include the French striker Thierry Henry (Arsenal), the Italian midfielder Francesco Totti (AS Roma), and the Italian referee Pierluigi Collini (who was also featured on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 3).The game is perhaps best known for being the first in the series to include a selection of fully licensed leagues, with the game featuring over 200 national and club sides. In previous instalments the games were forced to alter official team and player names as these were exclusively licensed to competing titles.Referees and other match officials were also introduced to the game for the first time, alongside general 'wear and tear' effects on the players such as the accumulation of dirt on their clothing. The Master League mode also received a drastic overhaul, and featured support for up to 138 teams.Game FeaturesOver 3000 licensed playersFully licensed leagues and teams from Serie A, Liga Espanola, Eredivise57 National Teams80 European Club Teams56 licensed kitsOn pitch refereeDetailed player profilesTeamsLicensed TeamsEuropeAustriaBelgiumBulgariaCroatiaCzech RepublicDenmarkEnglandFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryRepublic of IrelandItalyLatviaNetherlandsNorthern IrelandNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaRussiaScotlandSerbia and MontenegroSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandTurkeyUkraineWalesAfricaCameroonCÃ´te d'IvoireMoroccoSenegalNigeriaSouth AfricaTunisiaThe AmericasCosta RicaMexicoUnited StatesJamaicaArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaEcuadorParaguayPeruUruguayVenezuelaAsia/OceaniaChina PRIranSaudi ArabiaJapanKorea RepublicAustralia</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6260">FIFA International Soccer</game><game id="5605">FIFA Manager 06</game><game id="3753">FIFA Manager 07</game><game id="1787">FIFA World Cup: Germany 2006</game><game id="14877">2002 FIFA World Cup</game><game id="37">FIFA Soccer 07</game><game id="3383">FIFA Soccer 97</game><game id="19350">FIFA Soccer 08</game><game id="19086">Total Club Manager 2004</game><game id="1586">Total Club Manager 2003</game><game id="15714">Total Club Manager 2005</game><game id="26702">FIFA 10</game><game id="2629">UEFA Euro 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19490/688382-pro_evolution_soccer_4.jpg</image></root>
