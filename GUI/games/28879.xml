Its key innovation was the introduction of a point-and-click interface, utilizing a cursor to interact with objects on the screen. Along with these innovations, it still supported the traditional text-parser input used by other adventure games at the time.The PC-6001 port also featured another innovation for adventure games: speech synthesis. This allowed dialogues in the game to be voiced using speech synthesis.In addition, it was the first episodic adventure game, as the first part of the Legend of Star Arthur trilogy, followed by sequel Star Arthur Densetsu II: Ankoku Seiun (Legend of Star Arthur II: Dark Nebula) in December 1983 and Star Arthur Densetsu III: Terra 4001 (Legend of Star Arthur III: Terra 4001) in December 1984.PlotThe plot is a futuristic sci-fi space opera adaptation of the King Arthur legend. Set in the year 3826, the Galactic Federation is at war with the galactic fleet of Jamil. As the war wages on, Star Arthur travels to Planet Mephius in search of a legendary sword.External linkWakusei Mephius, Project EGG </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28487">Wingman</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="28882">Star Arthur Densetsu III: Terra 4001</game><game id="28881">Star Arthur Densetsu II: Ankoku Seiun</game><game id="36497">Star Cruiser</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/59247/1155833-stara1.jpg</image></root>
