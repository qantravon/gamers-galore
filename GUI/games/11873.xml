The rules are simple, there are forty cards displayed face down on the screen. Each turn the player  flips two cards. When the symbols on the cards are the same, the player earns a  point and flips another two cards and can continue until he does not match a pair. When the symbols are different, then the next  player has a chance to flip two cards. The game ends when all pairs are found and there are no more cards on the screen. The player  with the most number of points/pairs is the winner.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4607">Solitare</game><game id="22973">Gin Rummy</game><game id="25288">Spider Solitaire</game><game id="26249">Memorania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/938384-1193933392_02.png</image></root>
