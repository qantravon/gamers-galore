You discover that you've been cloned and are transforming into a machine. To prevent this transformation, you must search the galaxy to destroy five other clones who contain some of your bodily fluids. The gameplay is from a first person perspective and has music from French electronic composer Jean-Michel Jarre.GameplayThe game uses an icon based UI which is used to speak to aliens you encounter when travelling the galaxy. The interface is used to gain trust and information as to the location of other planets. The game takes place on Blood's ship, called The Ark. Part of the gameplay involves navigating worlds and travelling to other planets via the co-ordinates obtained from other aliens.As the game progresses, Blood's health decreases and causes the on screen cursor to shake, making the game harder to play.
