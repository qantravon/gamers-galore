Though the format was not new to Nintendo's platform, this would be the first chance for players outside of Japan to divine their future with 8-bit software.As with Tarot, much of the game's clairvoyancy is derived from tarot cards. The standard astrological horoscope also factors into the game's divination process to some extent.Notably, the game was one of the first (official) video games to be promoted specifically as an "adults-only" product intended for players aged 14 and up. It also carried the warning that it was meant for entertainment purposes only and none of its predictions are meant to be taken seriously.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22220">Master of Illusion</game><game id="40397">Chuugoku Senseijutsu</game><game id="40529">Tarot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362288-nes_taboo.jpg</image></root>
