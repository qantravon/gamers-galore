Both versions of the game were developed independently, with minor differences between each system. For example, the time periods that each versions contain are slightly different. In the BBC Micro version, the player visits 1916, 1940, 1970, 1984, and 1999, while in the Commodore 64 version the player visits 1919, 1940, 1970, 1984, and 2001.  Gameplay  Destroying enemies in the final time period.     Space Pilot is a multi-directional top-down shooter. The game has five different time periods that the player visits, in ascending order. Each level has enemies appropriate to that time period. For example, the 1970 time period contains helicopters, while the 2001/1999 time period contains space ships, and takes place in space.  In order to finish each level, the player must destroy a certain amount of enemies in order to deplete a time meter. This time meter determines when the player will teleport to the next time period. In each level, there are no boundaries. The player can fly in any direction indefinitely, as the background wraps.  After a certain amount of enemies are destroyed, and the time meter is near depletion, a boss flies in that must then be destroyed in order to move on. These bosses are typically just larger versions of the enemies encountered in that respective time period (e.g. in the 1916/1919 time period, a large jet appears after all of the smaller jets have been destroyed).  The enemies that appear in each time period change from version to version (for example, the BBC Micro version contains blimps and paratroopers), but the underlying gameplay is retained.    </description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13141">Time Pilot</game><game id="22654">Time Pilot '84</game><game id="4309">Battle Through Time</game><game id="3466">Bosconian</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16706/1730321-space_pilot_1.png</image></root>
