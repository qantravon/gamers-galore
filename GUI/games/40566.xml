As with the first game, the goal is to help a sentient pachinko ball named Pachio-kun bankrupt a series of pachinko parlors and liberate all his miniature brethren from their flashy mechanical gulags.The game introduces Pachio-kun's wife, presumably named Pachio-chan. If she's upset about her husband's gambling addiction, she never shows it.</description><genres><genre id="49">Gambling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39826">Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun</game><game id="40385">Pachinko GP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2370922-pachiokun_2_fc.jpg</image></root>
