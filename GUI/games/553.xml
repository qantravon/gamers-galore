Additional turns could be obtained through real currency transactions. This presumably gave players the advantage needed to win cash prizes in competitive rounds of the game. The game is no longer available.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
