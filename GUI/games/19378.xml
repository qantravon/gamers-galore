The king announces a dragon tournament, where the winner will win the princess and become the new king. Flicker then starts on his quest to become a knight so he can compete in, and hopefully win, the tournament. The game is a twist on the legend of King Arthur, while also interweaving other legends humorously, such as the origin of Stonehenge being a trap for dragons that was later put into destroyed. To become a squire, Flicker must find the Knights of the Square Table.Cheech Marin, Terry Jones and Harry Shearer are just a few names to provide voices in the game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3460">Discworld</game><game id="22906">Tiny Toon Adventures: Toonenstein Dare to Scare</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23541/1474522-blazing_dragons__u___slus_00100__front.jpg</image></root>
