RPM puts players in customizable cars that drive around isometric tracks. By using the D-pad to incrementally change the car's heading, the player can maneuver around corners and avoid opponents and obstacles on the track. Too many collisions causes the player's car to explode, which takes them out of the race for a few seconds before they can respawn.The game was based on the earlier EA racing title Racing Destruction Set. A planned sequel, RPM II, would eventually become Rock 'n Roll Racing and focus more on the combat elements, as well as adding a sci-fi presentation and SNES renditions of famous rock music. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7458">Racing Destruction Set</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26763/1135247-rpm_racing.jpg</image></root>
