Takeru  is asked to help the girls, to which he agrees mainly because he feels  they will be VERY grateful for being rescued.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23632">Lightning Warrior Raidy</game><game id="24749">Lightning Warrior Raidy II: Temple of Desire</game><game id="29019">Lightning Warrior Raidy III</game><game id="33378">Magic Knight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/86598/1310119-dragonknightii1.jpg</image></root>
