You can use over 20 different vehicles to help you in the fight including land sea and air. Also there are over 30 different weapons at your disposal ranging from mines to light machine guns. There are 4 different classes to choose from, each with 2 different weapon layouts. Like Battlefield 1942 before it this is a multiplayer focused game but with a single player campaign and runs on the ReFractor 1 engine.There are two main types of themes for the different battlefields.Urban levels involve fighting from building to building, street to street. These levels will get you up close and personal with the enemy creating tense confrontations. The tight spaces make vehicle maneuvering hard and create bottlenecks, making them good ambush areas.Jungle levels are more organic and contain large open areas, either over plains or water, which may prove effective for sniping and driving. They are contrasted to very dense inner jungle areas where close combat requires quick reactions to stay alive.ClassesAs well as selecting a class in game the player can choose a different head and body.AssaultBackup has arrivedThe assault class is equipped with an assault rifle and grenades. Each layout is similar, with the only difference being what type of assault rifle you are equipped with.EngineerThe engineer class has two very different layouts. One layout gives the player which allows the engineer class to double as a demolitionist. The other layout gives the player a motor which gives the engineer somewhat of a support role.Anti Tank/VehicleThe anti tank class is somewhat of a mix of heavy weapons and anti vehicle. Each layout gives the player a light machine gun but one layout will give the player a anti tank rocket while the other will give the player a anti air rocket or some form or grenade luncher depending on which side you are on.ReconA similar to the assault class as in it really only allows the player to select a different type of rifle in each layout.MultiplayerBattlefield Vietnam allows up to 64 players to battle at one time over 14 different battlefields (extra maps added in a patch). There are a total of three different game modes.ConquestThe same as in Battlefield 1942, there are capture points on a map and each team must battle to keep control of as many as possible, Whichever team has the least amount of capture points will start to "bleed" as in there ticket count will start to fall. When the ticket count of a team hits 0 the other team wins the round.EvolutionThe mode still has the capture points but at the end of the round the scores are saved and depending on which team won another level will load, once a team wins enough to posh the enemy back to the last level and win, this will determine which team is the winner. Only 5 of the levels are playable with this mode.Custom CombatThis is also similar to Conquest expect the host of the game can change what types of vehicles can spawn. For example the host of the game can set it up so that there are only scooters.Other FeaturesRadioThe Radio in Battlefield Vietnam allows players to play songs from the Soundtrack listed below in the vehicle that they are in. Other players in the vicinity of the vehicle can hear the music as well. The music can also be changed to allow players to play their own music but only they will hear the music. Other players will only hear the song that the player changed.SoundTrackAll Day and All of the Night - The KinksFortunate Son - Credence Clearwater RevivalGet Ready - Rare EarthHush - Deep PurpleI Fought the Law - Bobby Fuller FourNowhere to Run - Martha and the VandellasOn the Road Again - Canned HeatPsycthotic Reaction - Count FiveSomebody to Love - Jefferson AirplaneSurfin Bird - TrashmanShakin' All Over - The Guess WhoThe Letter - The Box TopsThe Ride of the Valkries - Budapest Symophony OrchestraYou Really Got Me - The KinksWar - Edwin StarWhite Rabbit - Jefferson AirplaneWild Thing - Troggs</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5274">Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII</game><game id="21912">Planetside: Core Combat</game><game id="15172">Shellshock: Nam '67</game><game id="17429">Vietcong: Purple Haze</game><game id="23254">Shellshock 2: Blood Trails</game><game id="7334">Crossfire</game><game id="18758">Codename: Eagle</game><game id="10768">Battlestations: Midway</game><game id="17179">Starsiege: Tribes</game><game id="25262">Battlefield 1943</game><game id="26423">Call of Duty: Black Ops</game><game id="504">Platoon</game><game id="32924">The Hell in Vietnam</game><game id="526">NAM</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/839193-915255_front.jpg</image></root>
