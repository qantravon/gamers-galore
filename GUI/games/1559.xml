Super Pac-Man has not been as popular a game for ports as its predecessors, but has been ported a number of times, including an unreleased port to the               Atari 5200, DOS and              Commodore 64 versions, a release on the             PlayStation in the            Namco Museum collection,           Game Boy Color as part of the Ms. Pac-Man cart, the          Wii as part of         Namco Museum Remix, and   Xbox 360 as part of       Namco Museum Virtual Arcade. Gameplay   Super Pac-Man does away entirely with the standard dots of the previous two games. Instead, the game focuses on item collection, though still within similar mazes. In order to access the items, whether they are fruit or power pellets, the player must first eat keys to open doors accessing them. In later levels, keys open doors further away from the location of the key. As with dots in the first two games, all items must be consumed in order for the player to progress to the next level  In addition, the game contains "super pellets" which can be eaten to turn     Pac-Man into the titular Super Pac-Man, increasing his size and speed, making him invulnerable to ghosts, and allowing him to eat through doors without the corresponding key.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3269">Crystal Castles</game><game id="4559">K.C.
