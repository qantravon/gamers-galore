As you explore the caves and make your way to the surface, you find relics that grant new abilities.   At first you can only jump, but soon you can double jump, glide, wall climb, sprint, survey your surroundings, and blow up blocks.   You can also collect roots that are scattered around the caves to upgrade each ability.    Average gametime is about 60-90 minutes, but speed run experts have completed it in less than 30 minutes.    </description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/101852/1443158-boxartfinal.jpg</image></root>
