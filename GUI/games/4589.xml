<root><id>4589</id><name>Independence Day</name><description> The Movie   Independence Day   is a 1996 science fiction film about a hostile alien invasion of Earth, focusing on a  group of individuals and families as they coincidentally converge in the Nevada desert and, along with the rest of the human population, participate in a last-chance retaliation effort on July 4 against the alien invaders. It was directed by Roland Emmerich, who co-wrote the script with producer Dean Devlin. The GamePC-SAT-PS    Independence Day combines the precision flying experience of a flight sim with the riveting, adrenaline-pumping excitement of an action game. At least that's what the sales people at Fox Interactive said when this game launched way back in 1997.  The game itself is based on the movie plot, taking some of the movies more memorable action scenes and using them in the game. Independence Day has a basic mission structure, you are briefed on the mission goals, choose your plane. Then you play through the mission earning currency for shooting down alien scum and then get to choose a new plane to buy. You also get to fly the alien fighter plane/UFO which is light years before the measly human adversaries.   For the time this game was able to beautifully render whole cities like Tokyo and New York with fairly good accuracy. The game also features multiplayer, Internet or split-screen.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3605">Ace Combat 2</game><game id="6250">Air Combat</game><game id="20037">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</game><game id="1602">Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies</game><game id="14827">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</game><game id="19273">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9261/307373-70_8.jpg</image></root>
