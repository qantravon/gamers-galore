The probe appears to be an attempt to make contact with the human race and it contains blue prints for a vessel which will make it possible for us to travel to another solar system.If you want to know more about the probe, you need to send someone to the moon and retrieve it. What if this is only the beginning? What if there are more fragments for the space vessel? In that case you need to find all the pieces before the signal from the probe goes out entirely. What if you've just begun a journey with an unknown goal, and will take a whole generation to complete.System Requirements:Win 95/98/2000/XP - Pentium 75MHz - 16MB RAM - 2X CD-Rom</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36309">Djuphavsjakten</game><game id="36321">Sverigejakten</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67046/1879944-rymdjakten.jpg</image></root>
