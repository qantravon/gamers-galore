<root><id>3696</id><name>A Blurred Line</name><description>A Blurred Line is a role-playing game, written and developed by Lysander86 using RPG Maker 2000. It's a top-down isometric game that tells the story of Talan, a young man framed for the murder of his boss, the Director. The game was renowned in the early English-language RPG Maker community for its well-written narrative.A Blurred Line was intended as a trilogy. The first part was released in October 2000, followed by the second part, The Line Narrows, in March 2001. The final instalment of the game, Line's End, has yet to be released, after more than a decade. Much like Shenmue III, the narrative was thus unable to reach a conclusion. </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36626">RPG Maker 2000</game><game id="37036">The Way</game><game id="1187">Shenmue II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15392/446151-abl.png</image></root>
