<root><id>15318</id><name>Plastron</name><description>Overview Plastron is a side-scrolling futuristic action game, taking place on the titular planet Plastron. The game was released for the Atari 8-bit by Harlequin Software in 1990. Plastron was never released in the United States, but it was released in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, all around the same time.   The game takes place in a future dominated by the mega-corpartion known as Omni-Corp. They have mined the planet Plastron for the plaits 500 years, as the exclusive source for fossil fuels. Waning resources and high fuel prices prompts others to take action, with the player taking control of the Scavenger One spacecraft. The goal is to gather as many resources as possible. Gameplay  The Scavenger One gathers fuel tokens.     Gameplay itself is akin to Moon Patrol. Players progress from the left side of the screen to the right, with partial Z axis control as well, dodging obstacles and gathering fuel tokens. Some portions of the game contain enemies, but these are not as common as craters or rocks, which damage the craft.  Players begin with a limited amount of jumps, which can be used to dodge obstacles on the surface of the planet. Jumps can be replenished by picking up fuel tokens. At the end of each level, fuel tokens are loaded into a larger ship, given that the player completes the level within the allotted time limit.    </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1759106-screen_shot_2011_04_14_at_4.43.37_pm.png</image></root>
