Tetsudou-Oh also borrows elements from the Game of Life board game, specifically the lucky/unlucky event that follows every turn and can completely reverse a player's fortunes.Tetsudou-Oh would be followed by Tetsudou-Oh '96 and Tetsudou-Oh 2, both for the Sony PlayStation. The original game would also see a mobile phone platform remake, named Tetsudou-Oh NEO.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25496">Itadaki Street: Watashi no Omise ni Yottette</game><game id="19583">Momotaro Dentetsu</game><game id="2958">Monopoly</game><game id="39866">Yuu Yuu Jinsei</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2328642-tetsudou_oh_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
