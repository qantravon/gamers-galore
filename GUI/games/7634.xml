It was released in 1994 for the PC, as the brainchild of Cliff Bleszinski. It shares some similarities with the Sonic the Hedgehog games, and has been described as "Sonic The Hedgehog with guns". The game features six episodes; each episode consists of three worlds consisting of two stages and third boss stage. Unlike Sonic, Jazz has a life bar which can be replenished by collecting carrots, and he defeats his enemies by shooting them with an arsenal of weaponry rather than by jumping on them.The game's storyline escalates the interspecies rivalry found originally in the fable of the "tortoise and the hare" into an intergalactic conflict. In it, Jazz must liberate the rabbit planet of Carrotus from the evil turtle mastermind Devan Shell and his reptile army, saving Princess Eva Earlong in the process.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11133">Earthworm Jim</game><game id="8239">Earthworm Jim 2</game><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="4628">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</game><game id="7042">Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project</game><game id="21209">Commander Keen</game><game id="15544">Super Mario Bros.</game><game id="14433">Sonic CD</game><game id="23126">Lew Leon</game><game id="12488">Jill of the Jungle: The Complete Trilogy</game><game id="10152">Bucky O'Hare</game><game id="7227">Abuse</game><game id="655">Alien Carnage</game><game id="9742">Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel</game><game id="16524">Cyril Cyberpunk</game><game id="8571">Hocus Pocus</game><game id="12022">Superfrog</game><game id="18541">Jill of the Jungle</game><game id="11317">Guimo</game><game id="14930">Kid Chaos</game><game id="6536">Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck</game><game id="31631">Jump Jack 2</game><game id="31282">Jump Jack</game><game id="37637">Hell Yeah!
