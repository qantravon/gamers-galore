Players would take control of a bounty hunter on the planet Coruscant from a third person, over-the-shoulder perspective. Unlike many other Star Wars games, the protagonist would not have had Force powers or a lightsaber at his disposal.The title referred to Level 1313, an underground district of Coruscant dominated by criminals.GameplayThe demo shown at E3 2012 demonstrated both Uncharted-like platforming, with the character using ledges and handholds to climb on a burning ship, and cover-based shooting.DevelopmentWork on the game was halted when LucasArts was shut down in April 2013. While the possibility of licensing the game to another company was left open, insiders have reported that no publisher showed interest. It is unlikely that the game as it existed will ever be finished.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2223511-screen_shot_2012_05_31_at_10.21.06_pm.png</image></root>
