Ikari III: The Rescue was a bit of a departure from the previous two games, because there was almost no shooting involved. This game plays mostly like a top-down view version of a beat-em up arcade game. There are, however, a few moments when it becomes a shooter.The story for the Arcade version goes as follows: The child of a presidential candidate is kidnapped by terrorists. The 2 best soldiers have been asked to take this matter into their own hands.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10360">Mercs</game><game id="14068">Guerrilla War</game><game id="3683">Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361851-nes_ikariwarriors3.jpg</image></root>
