Due to technical limitations, the game can only display three balls (plus the player cue ball) at any given time, so multiple gameplay modes which work around this limitation were implemented. GameplayIn each mode, the player controls a cue dot which may be positioned around the cue ball. The fire button controls force; the longer it is held prior to release, the more forceful the shot. English, or spin, is controlled by leaning the joystick prior to releasing the button. There are three distinct gameplay modes.TrickshotThe player must sink each ball in 9 distinct setups. For one or two players. Additionally, practice modes allow the player to work on each setup individually. Two player games may end in a tie.Pool and English BilliardsEach player takes turns using streamlined pocket billiards rules; there is no 8-ball. Various scoring rules differ between Pool and English Billiards, but gameplay is largely the same.  </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="26">Billiards</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2042">Side Pocket</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1258557-tumblr_kx0bz1n4yu1qzurbto1_500.jpg</image></root>
