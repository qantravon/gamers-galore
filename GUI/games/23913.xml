This NES title is the first of a series of games based on that manga and anime.The goal of the game is to locate the thieves that broke into the home of the kindly Professor Ochanomizu and stole a considerable sum of money and return said stolen funds to the professor. Astro Boy has a series of powers in his arsenal, but is powered by uranium which steadily depletes as the game progresses. He has a basic punch and is able to triple jump and even fly in brief spurts.The game is notably odd as there are several different actions that are required to recover all the money, some of which are ambiguous and poorly conveyed to the player.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19745/692582-astro_boy_nes.png</image></root>
