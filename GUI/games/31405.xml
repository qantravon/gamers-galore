You control a small ship and must race it through the different challenges that take place all over the galaxy. GameplayYou get to choose which challenge you want to take part in. Each challenge is associated to a fake space month (noot, stynarto, cavery, masra, ptnor, thion and praa) and each month has two different challenges that are all in fact races where you get prize money by winning. The aim is to collect 100.000 Gs (G is the ficitve currency in the game) which allows you to participate in the alleykat finale. You pilot your ship using the joystick and fire at enemies and obstacles using the action button. Your ship has different flightmodes that you can change by holding down the action button and a direction with the joystick. Holding the action button and the joystick back will make your ship backflip. Holding the action button and moving the joystick left or right will make your ship go into attack mode, unleashing extra turrets. You can also make the ship go into fast mode by holding the action button and the joystick forward. You also control your ships altitude by moving the joystick backwards or forwards.
