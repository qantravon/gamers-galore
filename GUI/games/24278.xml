You control a mech that goes around blowing up tanks, helicopters and other mechs. Along the way you can switch between weapons on the fly in order to combat your enemies easier. A shield can be used to defect shots as well but like all your tools they eventually run out. Near the end of most stages you should expect a gigantic boss of some kind to stop you from progressing.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="31791">Night Slave</game><game id="15559">Metal Warriors</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1673193-assault_suit_leynos_2_box_front.jpg</image></root>
