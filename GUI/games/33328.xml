It has two modes of play, adventure mode (which tells the story) and golf mode, which gets you straight to the golf. You can either play against the CPU or a friend in golf mode. There are a variety of options in both the dialogue sequences and golf sequences; of course the game wouldn't be complete without special golf techniques!  The game features 16 courses; Each match is 2 out of 3 holes. The computer can be quite a tough opponent. STORY     Mizuhara Yui was a normal 16 year old girl who simply happened to be extremely skilled at golf. Unfortunately for her, this skill brought her to the attention of "Dark Hazard".  Dark Hazard is an evil organization bent on world domination through golf superiority and masterminded by the mysterious Professor G. They kidnap Yui and her friend and fellow golf genius Ryuzaki Ran to convert them in to "kaizou ningen" (改造人間) battle golfers in a manner that parodies Kamen Rider. Yui is saved by Doctor T, Professor G's brother, before her brain was altered. But what happened to Ran? After hearing about a "Hazard Cup" Tournament being put on by Dark Hazard, Yui decides to participate and sets out to Gil Country Club in hopes of finding her friend... and perhaps taking down Dark Hazard while she's at it! CHARACTERS Yui.     Mizuhara Yui: The protagonist, she is a 16 year old golf genius.
