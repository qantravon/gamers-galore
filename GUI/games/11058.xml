GameplayAction fighter is an overhead action vehicular combat game which has the player progressing through stages in order to complete missions, ie. sink three submarines. Levels begin with a super bike capable of transforming into a jet ski, sports car, helicopter and even an F1 car as checkpoints are hit or powerups are consumed. Each vehicle is equipped with a unique weapon and each triggers a new segment of gameplay (land, sea, air).   The game features a number of enemy vehicles to go along with secondary elements like huts to bomb and friendly Sega trucks that would provide additional firepower when entered. Helicopter levels play as a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up and resembles "Xevious".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10448">Spy Hunter</game><game id="1487">Xevious</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/745172-acfist0f.jpg</image></root>
