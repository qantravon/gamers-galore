The game was a launch title for Microsoft's Kinect device. Much like other Kinect-only titles, this title requires around 7-10 feet of space to function optimally, with preferably more space if two users wish to play simultaneously. Players control their Xbox 360 avatars in various sporting events and mini-games. Included is Party Play mode, which allows up to 12 players (split into 2 teams) to compete against each other.ActivitiesKinect Sports lets you play 6 different sports, and various mini games based around the included events. All events can be played in local and online multiplayer modes, and some in cooperative modes.Beach VolleyballLike in real volleyball, you put your hands together and make an upward movement to send the ball back. Players can jump and spike the ball to increase the power and speed of their shot. Volleyball can be played in versus or cooperative modes in multiplayer.SoccerIn soccer, the players pass the ball to each other while the opposing team tries to intercept it. While players doesn't have any direct control over their team, players will automatically position themselves into spots where you can pass the ball to them by kicking in that direction. During a penalty kick in multiplayer, one player plays as goalie, the other plays as the kicker. When in control of the goalie, the player can catch the ball or simply hit it away from the goals. The kicker can use either leg to direct the ball toward the goal.BoxingBoxing is played through a first person perspective, letting you punch, jab and block with your hands. This sport can be played against AI or in competitive local and online multiplayer.BowlingBowling is played by making the under arm bowling movement. Players can select the hand they use to bowl with before the beginning of every bowl. The direction and spin of the ball can be controlled by the player by moving left or right in their play space, and swinging their arm in the direction they wish to spin the ball.Table TennisYou play table tennis by using your hand as a paddle, swinging it to smash and curve the ball. You can also control the power and direction of the shot depending which hand you use, and how you attack the ball.Track and FieldTrack and Field lets you take part in a variety of sports such as javelin, discus, sprinting, hurdles and long jump. For example, javelin requires you hold your arm up as though you were holding a javelin while making a small run-up before throwing.

A female demo person joined him as they prepared to show off a game of hurdles. The lady and the man were super pumped and made jokes such as "get a good look of my back".When the race was supposed to start, the presentation ran into some technical difficulties, the race refusing to start.
