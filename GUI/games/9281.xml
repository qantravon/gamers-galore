The premise of the game is based around "quick fire" rounds that test your accuracy and reactions.The game is structured in a very random manner with four non-related stages being displayed for you to choose from each time you complete a stage. Stages are comprised of accuracy tests such as having to shoot the apple off the head of a far away character with only one bullet or judgment tests, such as killing only bad guys in a sea of good guys. Other stages involve solving puzzles by shooting out keys on a keyboard to spell words.Point blank also featured full 2 player co-op and Vs. modes.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21468">Time Crisis 4</game><game id="17486">Mad Dog McCree</game><game id="15365">Time Crisis 2</game><game id="6490">Hogan's Alley</game><game id="20519">Ghost Squad</game><game id="15008">Confidential Mission</game><game id="16218">Battle Clash</game><game id="3484">Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge</game><game id="1538">Ghoul Panic</game><game id="33475">Golgo-13 3 - Juusei no Chinkonka</game><game id="33474">Golgo-13</game><game id="33477">Golgo-13 2 - Kiseki no Dandou</game><game id="33679">Mighty Hits Special</game><game id="33678">Mighty Hits</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/687714-poblps0f.jpg</image></root>
