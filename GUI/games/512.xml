<root><id>512</id><name>Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit</name><description>OverviewWhen Tim receives his own line of tools called, "Taylor-Turbo Power Tools," they are quickly stolen from the Tool Time set before he can get his hands on them. Who is behind this brash theft? It is none other than the work of spies. Tim has to get his tools back from those sneaky spy ninjas. However, the Tool Man cannot fight spies with soley fists and signature Chuck Norris roundhouses alone. Eight ultra-powerful tools are at your disposal, with notable mentions being a nail gun, blowtorch, and chainsaw. Tim's cohost Al and his children are also present to help rescue his tools and bring back justice to the Binford brand.Fun FactThe game was not packaged with a manual. Instead, loading screens read, "Real men do not use instructions."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19067">Walt Disney's The Jungle Book</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5169/307713-87_8.jpg</image></root>
