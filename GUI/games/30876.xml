To me, this game is a  break I need from my seriousness and deeper meaning, so it has to be a  character who have a personality that lets him/her run around and e.g.  throw bombs at random creatures and enemies."</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19985">Knytt Stories</game><game id="19031">Knytt</game><game id="2787">Knytt Experiment</game><game id="7406">Super Mario Bros. 2</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="16751">Within a Deep Forest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13349/1338647-screenshot_4.png</image></root>
