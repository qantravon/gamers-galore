Capsules  are shot from the ground, that when shot open contains either a ship  upgrade or powerup.     Transformation  - The very first item that comes out of the capsule is an upgrade that  transforms the ship into a flying   robot that has a  shield. This shield  can take a few hits before transforming back into a ship.   - With each upgrade the robot transforms and gains a different type of  weapon.  - Pressing button 2 (B) will let the Robot use his shield to block shots head on.   Power ups  - After shooting the capsule open, if they player shoots again the ship  upgrade will change to a power up.  - Power ups include bonus points, stopping enemies for a certain amount of time, and becoming indestructible for a limited amount of time. During this indestructible phase, the ship/robot cannot shoot but can fly into enemies for tremendous amounts of points.   Released on Xbox Live Arcade and PC       Game Room on  3/24/2010.    </description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20472">1942: Joint Strike</game><game id="10466">1942</game><game id="10516">River Raid</game><game id="16693">Raiden</game><game id="5962">Raiden II</game><game id="413">Raiden III</game><game id="24002">Raiden IV</game><game id="30347">Raiden Trad</game><game id="6813">Sky Shark</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8960/1720973-finalizer.png</image></root>
