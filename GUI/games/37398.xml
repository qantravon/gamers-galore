<root><id>37398</id><name>Cube World</name><description>OverviewCube World is a PC RPG inspired by games such as The Legend of Zelda and Diablo set in a huge world made up of voxels. The player can choose a character of several classes and races and can enter the generated world alone or with friends to perform quests, kill monsters and hunt for treasure.Despite it's similarity in looks to something like Minecraft, there are no plans to make it about mining or digging, and currently only enemies can cause destruction in the world. The building will be limited to placing prefab house pieces built from blueprints, and the crafting is for creating and upgrading player weapons and armor.The game has been in development by Picroma, the software duo Wolfram von Funck and his wife Sarah since May 2011.There is currently no release window besides "when it's done", but it will be a fully featured RPG with classes, races, quests, items, building, crafting, weapon/armor upgrades, pets, and multiplayer server support, though the maximum number of players is yet to be determined.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/40823/2121125-06__7_.jpg</image></root>
