Although the game is in 2D, it uses camera angles positioned behind the characters to create a 3D-like experience.GameplayThe game is controlled with a joysick and 3 buttons, though a deluxe edition of the game features motion sensors that allow the player to move his or her body to control the character in the game. The technology used was similar to that of the Sega Activator peripheral for the Mega Drive console, but with extra sensors to pull off better reaction sensing. This was thus the first successful example of full-body motion sensing in a video game.Once gameplay begins, the player fights through the entire roster of characters in a set order. Defeating each fighter earns a Dragon Ball. After defeating four fighters, the fifth battle is against a black-and-white carbon copy of the player's character who mimics each and every move. If he can be defeated, he reveals himself to be the final boss: an original character named Ozotto. Defeating Ozotto earns the last Dragon Ball and whatever wish the character's heart desires.External linkSegaâ€™s Wonderful Simulation Games Over The Years </description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26883">Police 911</game><game id="44162">KO Punch</game><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="31703">Kinect Sports</game><game id="24180">Mazan: Flash of the Blade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93538/1491504-0000.png</image></root>
