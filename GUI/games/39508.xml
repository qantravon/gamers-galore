The player controls a girl in a robot suit as she makes her away across various side-scrolling platformer levels. While in the robot suit, she is able to shoot and destroy enemies. Getting hit once will eject her from the broken suit, leaving her without a means to fight the enemies - at this point she can only avoid them.Like many games developed by Micronics, it is regarded as being of fairly poor quality.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2301406-miracle_ropits_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
