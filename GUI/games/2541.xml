Rifleman: shoots on a linear path. Lobber: Attacks using trial and error. Lob  Shoot: A combination of Lobber and Rifleman. Windless Wit: Perfect aim using parabolic attacks but can not compensate for wind. Windmaster: Windless Wit which can compensate for wind. Twanger: Attacks using rebounding walls.  If the walls are non rebounding, then attacks with linear shots. Mr. Stupid:  Attacks randomly, often killing itself.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23646">Death Tank</game><game id="12653">Scorched Earth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/57764/1334865-tankwars.png</image></root>
