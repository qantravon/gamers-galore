To the surprise of no one, Earth and the Galaxy were soon thrust into danger again, and as the Savior of Light it's Yuna's duty to involve herself in it. Most of the game is still light-hearted fluff, though.As before the player watches scenes play out and then makes a decision where needed, although there are fewer choices in this game. The Turn-based fighting system has been changed from the first game, and a selection of minigames have been added as well.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="44288">Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Collection</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/2390569-cover_galaxy_fraulein_yuna_2.jpg</image></root>
