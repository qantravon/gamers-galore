Each character unit on the battle field represents a party of characters and is associated with a dragon unit. Character units are actually a party of 4 characters that can engage in combat through either a single command or series or a set of individual commands through a sub-battle system that looks and feels like a traditional turn based RPG (such as Final Fantasy).The battle field combat is turn based in an I-Go-You-Go style. The player has a turn, followed by the enemy. The order of units is selected by the player, and all units must be issued a command for the turn to end.Character units are selected and can be moved. They use either field abilities, attack, or issue a state to their respective dragons. When using a field ability the unit attacks as a group through a single command. This form of command is similar to other Tactical RPGs (such as Shining Force). When using the attack command, a sub battle screen appears showing the enemy party on the left and the player party on the right. Commands are then issued for each party member. After the player party acts, the enemy party also gets the chance to react with a series of commands for its own party. These battle sequences take only a single turn.The sub-battle party screen.Dragons are partly autonomous, receiving only three commands which set their state of action. The player does not move them directly. They can be told to Come, Go, or Wait. The Come command keeps the dragon close to its associated character unit, attacking enemy units that are nearby. Go sends the dragon to attack at will. Wait retreats the dragon into a defensive position. If a dragon unit dies it impacts on its respective character units abilities.Character parties and their associated dragons can be reconfigured to the players liking. Dragons can also be fed items outside of battle to improve their stats. Improvements in stats cause the Dragons to transform into new types of dragon.

ReleaseThe fan translation is colorful to say the least.The game was only released in Japan for the Super Famicon (SNES). It has never had an official English translation. However, an unofficial fan translation ROM patch by the translation group DeJap exists as of 2002. The translation has a reputation for its humor and rude language.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11201">Treasure Hunter G</game><game id="21584">ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat</game><game id="24472">Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363646-snes_bahamutlagoon_jp.jpg</image></root>
