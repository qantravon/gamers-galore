The player then decides whether to push or stop for a certain round. Each time a blocked number appears, that die is eliminated for the rest of that player's round. Points are earned on each roll for the face amounts of non-blocked dice. If you run out of dice, your score for that round drops to 0.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7135/2423918-pylshot1.png</image></root>
