Although containing an interesting premise, the gameplay and execution of the game was lackluster, resulting in a poor showing at retail, and a harsh reception from critics and gamers alike.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9967">Medal of Honor: Heroes 2</game><game id="7524">Call of Duty 3</game><game id="2347">Call of Duty 2</game><game id="6026">Medal of Honor: Airborne</game><game id="17280">BioShock</game><game id="593">Shadowrun</game><game id="20532">Legendary</game><game id="15195">Hour of Victory</game><game id="20834">Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway</game><game id="20481">Battlestations: Pacific</game><game id="2397">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</game><game id="24858">Darkest of Days</game><game id="30150">Heartland</game><game id="20195">War Front: Turning Point</game><game id="26633">Homefront</game><game id="42581">Wolfenstein: The New Order</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1048157-gb.png</image></root>
