Some of the minor differences in this Game Boy Advance version are the ability to slightly move the camera and the additional noises that  Mario and  Luigi make (some lifted from  Super Mario 64.) Yoshi coins are also included in every level, whereas they appear infrequently in Super Mario World. The GBA release makes it possible to save at any checkpoint or level completion. The multiplayer is a remake of the original   Mario Bros. and supports single-pak play. Brilliantly, other titles in the Super Mario Advance series are able to be used in multi-pak play. Some design concessions are made due to the limitations of the hardware in comparison to the SNES. The visuals are downgraded slightly to preserve high framerate and memory on the cartridge, and the button layout is altered to fit the GBA's simpler controls.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15738">Donkey Kong Country</game><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="20963">Wario Land: Shake It!</game><game id="5215">Super Mario Advance</game><game id="15623">Go!
