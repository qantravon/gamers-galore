It plays in the style of '  Go Fish!', except instead of asking for a number it asks the player for a word, chosen randomly from a list of over 200 basic words which were chosen with the help of reading specialists. When the correct word is chosen by the player, an animated cat named Roxie says the word aloud, helping the player to learn the word and how to pronounce it.   It also has a feature allowing players, usually parents or teachers, to add their own words to the database. Roxie will not speak the word automatically, but a sound file cannot be recorded and added by the player. The game has several difficulty levels which adjust automatically depending on the proficiency of the player. This allows children of different ages and word skills to play the game. The difficulty can also be changed manually through a menu. It was developed for Windows 95, 98 and NT.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/74012/1307964-fish.gif</image></root>
