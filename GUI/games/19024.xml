Being banana-eaters, the Kongs travel toward it and discover that the banana is actually a banana spaceship. The ship begins to attack, but DK and Diddy quickly bring it to the ground. A banana alien named     Xananab exits the spaceship, and explains that he mistook the Kongs for  Kremlings. Xananab had a confrontation with the Kremling    Krew prior to the start of the game, in which the coveted Crystal Banana was stolen. The Crystal Banana is an item of tremendous power that comes from Xananab's home planet, and in the wrong hands can result in the destruction of entire planets. To apologize for destroying Xananab's spaceship, DK, Diddy, and Cranky agree to help Xananab and foil   King K. Rool's latest plan.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24988">CarneyVale Showtime</game><game id="9822">DK: King of Swing</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2267069-box_dkjc.png</image></root>
