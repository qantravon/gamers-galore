<root><id>1629</id><name>Call of Duty</name><description>OverviewCall of Duty was the first game of the studio Infinity Ward, and the first game in the popular Call of Duty series. Infinity Ward's 22 member team were makers of the critically acclaimed Medal of Honor: Allied Assault that left EA due to overbearing buisness practices and horrendous schedules, and joined Activision. Call Of Duty, much like the Medal of Honor series, was heavily inspired by Hollywood movies and TV series; Several campaigns and multiplayer maps were based off Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, and the Russian film: Stalingrad.Call Of Duty was a noteworthy game in the fact that it offered new concepts to both FPS and WW2 games. As far as mainstream FPS games were at the time, Call of Duty offered a fun experience with a dash of realism. Call Of Duty's motto "No one fights alone" rang true as player's found themselves in large scale battles with AI squadmates that did more than act as cannon fodder. Players were no longer invulnerable killing machines; in order to survive firefights, players had to utilize concepts such as taking cover, using suppressive fire, and throwing grenades to flush out enemies. Instead of being walking armories, the max number of weapons held was limited to two, not including the standard side arm and grenades.Call of Duty also helped introduce Iron Sights to FPS gaming which allowed for improved accuracy, and the ability to change the firing modes on specific weapons, a feature that is most noticeably absent in all the other games in the series. The game also offered the player to maneuver in either standing, crouched, or prone positions, each with varying speed and accuracy modifiers. Call Of Duty was also one of the first American WW2 games to show the other sides of the conflict, with both British and Russian campaigns. The game also incorporated the idea of 'Shellshock' from Saving Private Ryan, which is when the player narrowly avoided death from a grenade and was subject to a shaky cam, slo-mo, ringing of the ears, and the inability to move at normal pace. Multiplayer included the unique Headquarters mode (A variation of King of the Hill) and the Kill-cam, which would show who killed you, from where, and with what. The Kill-cam helped discourage campers and glitching.PlotYou play the game through three campaigns that place you in command of an American paratrooper, a British SAS operative and Russian infantry and tank soldiers. In addition to the infantry action, you also get to partake in a tank battle and there are several rail shooter segments where you must elope from the Germans in a car.An American soldier in the campaign modeThe first campaign puts you in the shoes of Pvt. Joey Martin of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division as he parachutes into France on the eve of D-Day, much like the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. You continue on with assault on the town of Sainte-Mere-Eglise followed by the defense of the town against a counter attack by German Panzer units, a car chase through German lines, an assault on a Brecourt manor, and two missions where you rescue captured British soldiers.You continue the game with the British campaign, with you playing as Sgt. Jack Evans of the British 6th Airborne division and the SAS, assisting in the capture of Pegasus bridge , the sabotage of a German battleship and lastly the sabotage of a V-2 vengeance missile base. You are also tasked with sabotaging anti-air defenses single-handedly around the Eder Dam, in preparation for the Dambusters Raid.You start off the Soviet campaign with the Battle of Stalingrad, in an effort to recapture the authentic feeling of the battle, you start off with no weapons and only a handful of ammunition with instructions to pick up a weapon from the man ahead of you after he is dead. You then battle in an underground sewer system and take part in a recreation of the Battle for Pavlov's House through the eyes of Pvt. (later promoted to Sgt.) Alexei Voronin in the 13th Guards Division and then later in the 150th Rifle Division. You then continue the Soviet campaign with the liberation of Poland, followed by a role as a tank commander as you take part in the opening stages on the battle of Kursk, which is incidentally the largest tank battle the world has ever seen. You end the Soviet campaign as an infantry soldier in Berlin with the raising of the Soviet flag above the ruins of the Reichstag. The game ends with a short video which chronicles the after effects in Berlin.Missions11 missions comprise the single player campaign and are split across three different countries (USA, Great Brittan and the Soviet Union). Additionally, there is one secret level only obtainable via the use of the level select code.AmericanCarentan - The first mission of the game, starts with the Normandy landings, climaxes on the night assault of Carentan, and ends with the counter attack the following day. The Player first experiences the "Shell Shock" feature of the game under machine gun fire during the initial attack. Based heavily on Band of Brothers.Brecourt - Originally placed as the fifth mission in the PC version of Call of Duty, Brecourt has the player running along trenches of Brecourt Manor during Operation Overlord. Based on the Brecourt Manor Assault as depicted in Band of Brothers' second episode, "Day of Days".Burnville - Based on the second mission of the PC version of Call of Duty and takes place chronologically prior to the Brecourt Manor Assault, just after midnight June 6, 1944. The 101st parachutes into a field outside of of a small village and must make their way through the village and disable the anti-aircraft guns behind the church.Prison Camp - An assault on a German prison camp to rescue British officers, Captain Price and Major Ingram, who become major players in the following British campaign.Foy - An entirely original urban-based mission, Foy takes places in the Belgium city of the same name. The level must be cleared out of German troops through close quarters fighting and then their flak cannon must be destroyed.Bunkers - Taking place soon after Foy, you play as paratroopers tasked to clear out German Bunkers. Intel found in one of the bunkers leads to the British mission to take out the V2 rockets.BritishCapture The Bridge - Based on the battle of Pegasus Bridge (Like Band of Brothers, the event was written about by historian Stephen Ambrose), you begin as part of the SAS landing in a glider, and then assault the bridge, eventually losing most of your squad as you struggle to take out a German Panzer with a captured Flak 88. The battle continues to the next day, where you must fight off a German counter attack.The Dam - Much like in the American campaign, your superiors impressed with previous performance task you with more clandestine operations. This is the only entirely solo mission in the game. Ends with the destruction of the dam.Airport - After destroying the Dam you are pursued by German's in their half tracks. Eventually you blow up a bridge, reach the airport, and man an AA gun in the attempt to shoot down Stuka divebombers. Captain Price commandeers a plane, and off you go.Battleship - An undisclosed time later, you find yourself dressed as a German sailor preparing to board. Captain Price dies in the holds of the battleship after planting charges, leaving you alone to fight your way out and scuttle the ship.V2 Rockets - Takes place in the Battle of the Bulge, a short time after the American's bunker assault in the Argonnes. A very open map that involves clearing several bunkers and placing explosives.RussianRed Square - Much like the opening of the film "Enemy at the Gates", the player begins with only a single clip of ammo, and can only run to avoid German machine gun fire and the aggressive Commisars. Eventually gaining a rifle, the player switches to the role of Russian sniper.Pezenskaia - Attempting to reach a train yard, the player is now reliant on the Scoped Mosin-Nasgat. Begins in the sewers and ends with the capture of the train station.Pavlov - Based on one story of the actual Sgt. Pavlov. The Russians attack and reinforce a building in Stalingrad. Although the actual occupation of the building lasted for months and caused the Germans a great number of casualties, the action is condensed in a several hour period that allows the player to use, for the only time, mounted Anti-tank rifles.Reichstag - One of the last battles in the European Theater, Russian troops fight bitterly in the bombed and burnt out Reichstag. The level is, interestingly, one of the easier in the game due to the sparse number of German troops. Ends with an NPC raising the Soviet flag on the top of the building.HiddenTank AssaultMultiplayerThe multiplayer in Call of Duty is very similar to other multiplayer games, containing respawing in deathmatch, selecting weapons when you start the game, and very fast-paced gameplay. The game restricts weaponry to its historical owners, allowing for more balance and realism. Several maps had unique weapons such as the Panzerfaust and FG42 in specific locations, there were some Machine Gun nests for the player to use, and each person spawned with their respective nation's grenades. The max number of players a server could have was around 64. Call of Duty, and especially its expansion, had the most vast and open spaced maps in the series.MapsThere are sixteen multiplayer maps in Call of Duty:BocageBrecourtCarentanChateauDawnvilleDepotHarborHurtgenNeuville (Added in patch 1.3)PavlovPOW CampRailyardRocketShipStalingradTigertown (Added in Patch 1.5)ModesDeathmatch - Classic free for all, with respawning.Team Deathmatch - Team based deathmatch.Retrieval - Allied players must seek and bring back important German documents. Offered on a very limited number of maps.Behind Enemy Lines - Call of Duty's King of the Hill mode. Players would kill Allied soldiers, for the opportunity to respawn as one in order to rack up points.Search and Destroy - Based off of Counter strike, the Allies would attack and attempt to destroy, through timed explosives, one of two important German targets varying from Artillery guns to cargo stockpiles. No respawning; match ended when a target was blown up, the bomb was defused, or either side was annihilated.Headquarters - The only entirely unique play mode, players would have to scramble to different locations on the map to capture a radio, and defend for as long as possible. The side that did capture the point would gain points, but would have a significantly lower spawn rate than the opposing team. Matches were either time based, or till players reached a specific score.WeaponsAll weapons in Call of Duty, including the United Offensive packBolt-action RiflesKar98kMosin-NagantSpringfieldLee-EnfieldSemi-automatic RiflesM1 GrandM1A1 CarbineG43 (CoD: UO only)SVT-40 (CoD: UO only)Submachine GunsMP40ThompsonStenPPSh-41SupportBARMP44BrenFG42Light/Medium machine gunsM1919 (CoD: UO only)MG34 (CoD: UO only)DP28 (CoD: UO only)SidearmsM1911LugerTT33 (CoD: UO only)Webley (CoD: UO only)Rocket LaunchersPanzerfaustPanzerscherk (CoD: UO only)Bazooka (CoD: UO only)GrenadesMk2RGD-33Mills BombSteilhandgranateSmoke Grenade (CoD: UO only)MiscellaneousMG42FlaK 88FlakverlingPTRS-41 (CoD: UO only)Mosin Nagant Ammo (CoD: UO only)M2 Browing Machine Gun (CoD: UO only)Flammenwerfer 35 (CoD: UO only)Call of Duty ClassicA remake of Call of Duty that features full Online Multiplayer was released on XBLA and PSN.

(English: a date with destiny) This name did not make the final cut of the game.ReceptionUpon its release Call of Duty received universal critical acclaim and holds a 91% average at both Metacritic and GameRankings. Call of Duty won several Game Of The Year awards in 2003. The game was nominated for "Best Game" at the Game Developers Choice Awards and even though it didn't win, Infinity Ward took home the award for "Rookie Studio Of The Year".The N-Gage version, however, was met with harsher criticism, netting a composite score of 58 on Metacritic. PGNx Media showered the game with praise and awarded it with a 9.0/10, lauding the graphics and audio. Other reviewers weren't so kind and harshly criticized the game for its close draw distance, low frame rate, artificial intelligence and length.PC System RequirementsMinimum RequirementsOS: Window XPProcessor: 600 MHz CPUMemory: 128MB RAMVideo Card: ATI Radeon 9600Hard Drive: 1.4GBof uncompressed free hard disk spaceRecommended RequirementsOS: Window XPProcessor: 2.4 GHz dual coreMemory: 1 GB RAMVideo Card: ATI Radeon 9600Hard Drive: 4 GB</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6026">Medal of Honor: Airborne</game><game id="4857">Medal of Honor: Frontline</game><game id="2638">Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Operation Resurrection</game><game id="17429">Vietcong: Purple Haze</game><game id="1179">IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946</game><game id="12716">Battlefield 1942</game><game id="19181">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</game><game id="3719">Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War</game><game id="21220">Battlefield Heroes</game><game id="9967">Medal of Honor: Heroes 2</game><game id="9223">World War II Combat: Iwo Jima</game><game id="35549">Furious 4</game><game id="26181">Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad</game><game id="36944">7554</game><game id="42860">Titanfall</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1614/1092147-cod_pc_us.jpg</image></root>
