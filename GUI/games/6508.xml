<root><id>6508</id><name>Perihelion</name><description>Perihelion is a role-playing game with a 3D view in the tradition of Eyeof the Beholder. It has a cyberpunk setting. Combat is turn based with computer hacking elements. While it has first person dungeon crawling aspects of early DD games, the scenes and locations change and the atmosphere is incredibly immersive. Battle locations are pre-set and laid out in a separate screen like games such as Shining Force, making "power gaming" unnecessary. It is also one of the early games to utilize a completely different form of "levelling" - the skills you use most go up as you use them, much like Oblivion. The game also had many stats and types of characters to work with, and death is permanent, meaning it takes real skill in assembling a diverse party to succeed. Top it off with amazing graphics. Created by Morbid Vision, released by Psygnosis in 1993.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1543/526112-perihelion_the_prophecy_b.gif</image></root>
