First released in 1992 as an ASCII-based game for DOS, the game has undergone numerous revisions over the following two decades and is still in development by creators Sami Maaranen and Erkka Lehmus, with the most recent version being released in 2013. The current game uses 2D tile-based graphics.UnReal World focuses on survival in the harsh climate of Northern Europe. The player must construct a shelter, gather and properly store food, and wear clothing to protect their extremities from frostbite. The setting is a fictionalized version of Finland in approximately 800-1200 AD and delves deeply into Finnish history and folklore.AvailabilityInitially, UnReal World was shareware, with a limited trial version available for free. However, as of February 2013, the game's creators have switched to a donation funded model similar to Dwarf Fortress.
