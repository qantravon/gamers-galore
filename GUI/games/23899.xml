The title is an exclusive  PlayStation Network download. Punisher: No Mercy features large interactive arenas with plenty of destructible objects that can be used to kill opponents in gruesome ways. Punisher: No Mercy is powered by  Unreal Engine 3. There are plenty of real world weapons, including, an  pump-action shotgun,  MP5 Submachine gun,  M249 SAW,  M4 Carbine, a  knife,  Missile Launcher, a  silenced  UZI or  TMP and other weapons. The player can carry three weapons, one long range, one short range and a special weapon. Each of the eight characters have a trademark or favorite weapon which is exclusive to them, so it becomes almost class based in a sense. Before the match, players can choose two special abilities (a la perks) called "mods."Multiplayer spans 4 maps at launch, which are also used to structure a single player in which you play bots. Modes include Deathmatch, One-vs-Many and Co-Op. Up to 8 players can play online.Maps*  Factory*  Docks*  Warehouse.Characters*  Punisher*  Jigsaw*  Silver Sable* Barracuda*  Bushwacker*  Microchip</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20458">Warhawk</game><game id="24876">CellFactor: Psychokinetic Wars</game><game id="18883">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</game><game id="2133">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</game><game id="20777">Call of Duty: World at War</game><game id="20655">Battlefield: Bad Company</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3952/683610-punisher_no_mercy.jpg</image></root>
