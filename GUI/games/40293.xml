Players must continuously click on ALL of the gods pictured, to continue delivering "love" to them. Any god that does not receive enough love eventually fades away. The game is over when any god disappears.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2354723-screen_shot_2012_10_29_at_8.41.02_am.jpg</image></root>
