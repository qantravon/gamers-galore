<root><id>4109</id><name>Street Sk8er</name><description>Street Sk8ter was a skateboarding video game released for the original Playstation. Unlike modern skateboarding games, the game is a racer in the vein of snow boarding games such as Cool Boarder or 1080 Snowboarding. There is one unique aspect of the game, however. If the player does not score enough points via pulling off sweet tricks, they'll be disqualified at various intervals. The trick is to balance racing with tricking.SoundtrackAll - Honey PeepsH20 - EverreadyH20 - Thicker Than WaterI Against I - Ordinary FightI Against I - Maybe TomorrowLess Than Jake - All My Best Friends Are MetalheadsLess Than Jake - Sugar in Your Gas TankPlastilina Mosh - EncendedorPlastilina Mosh - Monster TruckThe Pietasters - Out All NightGas Huffer - Rotten EggStraight Faced - AgainstWeston - Liz PhairBow  Arrow - World Is Breaking</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="23">Skateboarding</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18636">Tech Deck Skateboarding</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2276079-box_ss.png</image></root>
