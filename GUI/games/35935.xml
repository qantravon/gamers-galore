You play as two treasure hunters, called Wyv and Keep, and the twist here is that you control both of them at the same time. Both Wyv and Keep control identically, and the only differentiator between them is their appearance.In each level the goal is to open the exit, while avoiding the traps and obstacles in your way, and then get one of your characters to the exit. There is also treasure in the levels that you can collect, and depending on how fast you complete the level and how many times you retry the level, you get bonus treasure upon completion of the level.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/90792/2135449-screenshot.4.jpg</image></root>
