Each of the characters has a magic wand that acts as a whip, as well as a magic meter. It is possible to attack with either a normal attack, which uses a small amount of the player's magic meter or a strong attack, which has a large attack range but uses much more of the character's magic meter. When the whip strikes an enemy or enemies, the apprentice will pick up the enemy and begin carrying them around until they press the attack button again and throw them.The difference between the two wizard characters is simple: the boy wizard has a larger life meter but loses magic more quickly, and the girl wizard uses less magic with each attack but has a much shorter life meter.There are three types of stages:Normal Stages: Destroy every enemy.Boss Stages: These appear every five stages. Destroy the boss to win.Dragon Stages: These appear every ten stages. Destroy the dragon before it leaves. If the dragon does leave, destroy all of the regular enemies to complete the stage.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4995">Bubble Bobble</game><game id="8049">Bubble Bobble: Part 2</game><game id="12029">The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle</game><game id="25744">Donkey Kong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6182/2292258-magicalwhip2.jpg</image></root>
