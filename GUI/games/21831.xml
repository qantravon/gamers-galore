The game received good reviews and Sony released their own game in that style the PSP music enthusiasts. Like Phase, Beats generates its button presses based on the tempo and rhythm of the song.The game is only available for download through the PSP/PSN Store for $4.99USD.GameplayThe HUD features 3 gray circles arranged horizontally with the face buttons either coming from the left, top or right. Players must hit the corresponding face button at the right moment when it passes over the gray circle. To increase the difficulty, when the buttons come from the left, the player must hold the left button on the d-pad, hold the right d-pad button for notes coming from the right and no d-pad buttons if the notes are coming from the top. Flawlessly hitting each note will give the player a multiplier up to 8x. Successfully hitting notes that are glowing will fill up the overdrive, which can be activated once it's full to get an additional 2x multiplier on top of what you're already getting.PS Vita CompatibilityDespite not being in the official compatibility list, Beats can be played on the PS Vita. To do this, the user must first download the game to the PS3. From there, go to Content Transfer on the PS Vita and select the game for transfer. Once complete, the game will show up on the Vita's menu.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9436">Audiosurf</game><game id="25231">Jubeat</game><game id="7477">Phase</game><game id="38893">KickBeat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9753/245409-beats_scee_psp.png</image></root>
