Players can either select pre-configured MAVs, or use the MAV Lab which allows players to create their own custom aesthetic and weapons changes.Lore: Aftermath supports up to 8 players on user-hosted servers, while dedicated servers allow up to 24 players. A Siege mode was scheduled and completed internally which supported up to 32 players, but was never publicly released (NOTE: This mode will be available in standalone release).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13820">Starsiege</game><game id="17438">MechAssault</game><game id="13931">MechWarrior</game><game id="1407">MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat</game><game id="17041">MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries</game><game id="10363">MechWarrior 3</game><game id="934">MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries</game><game id="15134">MechWarrior 4: Vengeance</game><game id="19719">Chromehounds</game><game id="17861">MechAssault 2: LoneWolf</game><game id="12057">MechCommander</game><game id="18365">MechCommander 2</game><game id="7531">Shattered Steel</game><game id="20512">Exteel</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8287/884276-loreaftermath_08050802.jpg</image></root>
