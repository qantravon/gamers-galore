GameplayLufia: Curse of the Sinistrals is similar in story to it's predecessor but not in gameplay.  Instead of the game being a turned based RPG, it's an action RPG with the inclusion of many puzzles.  You no longer participate in turn based battles, but instead swing your weapon in real time and use character specific actions to solve puzzles.  Puzzles are found throughout the world and in most of the dungeons you visit in the world.   You control only one character at a time, but you're able to switch between them in real time by tapping their character portrait on the touchscreen. Each character uses his own special weapon type and has unique abilities that help you solve the various puzzles.   Maxim: He fights with basic long swords. He can make a fast forward dash which helps him overcome long distances.  Tia: She uses her suitcase to oppose her enemies. She can use this also as a grappling hook to either transport her over a cliff or snatch an object from the other side of a cliff.  Selan:  Selan is fighting with chakrams. She can throw them to reach distant switches and enemies.Guy: His strength makes him an expert user in heavy hammer-type weapons. This allows him to destroy huge rocks and other obstacles. Dekar: Dekar is an expert in weapon usage and is not limited to any kind of weapon type.  Artea: He uses long-ranged pistol-type weapons. His special ability is hovering which allows him to reach new heights through the help of an air vortex.The game also contains a rich RPG element in the GRID system.  The GRID system allows you to place blocks on a grid to increase the stats of your characters.  By doing so, you will become better in battle and can more easily traverse the world.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27199">Rune Factory 3: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="21486">Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="23516">Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="3666">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</game><game id="28324">Shounen Kininden Tsumuji</game><game id="22006">Dragon Ball: Origins</game><game id="7060">Lunar Knights</game><game id="21633">Soma Bringer</game><game id="21448">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</game><game id="27893">Cross Treasures</game><game id="23777">Phantasy Star Zero</game><game id="25152">Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow</game><game id="25657">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</game><game id="10252">Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime</game><game id="23977">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time</game><game id="22015">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</game><game id="9471">Children of Mana</game><game id="21371">Avalon Code</game><game id="22044">From the Abyss</game><game id="24225">Destiny Links</game><game id="20615">Summon Night: Twin Age</game><game id="21723">Elebits: The Adventures of Kai and Zero</game><game id="34076">Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection</game><game id="30423">Solatorobo: Red the Hunter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478668-box_lcots.png</image></root>
