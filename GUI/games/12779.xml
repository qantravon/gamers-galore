Thugs, animals, and supernatural beings that the evil Madanda has released upon waking from his slumber must be defeated. The game plays as a side-scrolling platformer/beat-em-up, with an agile character that controls very tightly but has a limited move set.There are seven colorful levels of various lengths and difficulty including one level where the player must fight a series of new bosses in rapid succession. Most bosses follow predictable patterns. Talismans, talisman power-ups, health power-ups, and jugs of water that provide protection against fire-breathing enemies can be found when enemies are defeated or when specific hidden areas are discovered. Like most games of the era, the player is sent back to the beginning of a level upon death.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3482">Shinobi</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362943-ms_kungfukid_eu.jpg</image></root>
