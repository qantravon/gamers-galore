<root><id>19577</id><name>Touchdown Fever</name><description>OverviewTouch Down Fever is a football game developed and published by SNK originally for the Arcades and was later ported to the NES in both the US and Japan under different publishers. It is actually the second ever American Football game developed for the system (the first being 10-Yard Fight), though by the time of its 1992 US release it was simply one of many.The Arcade version was known for its voice samples. It also had an unusual ball-shaped controller to be used whenever a player threw a ball to another teammate.The teams in the game can only be identified by their city of origin rather than being actual NFL teams. They include: Chicago, Detroit, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh for the "East" side and Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle for the "West" side. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362324-nes_touchdownfever.jpg</image></root>
