The result was an English football simulation the likes of which had never been seen, with the expanded commentary managing to recreate that Saturday feeling with aplomb. The key ingredients were in place for the first time and Championship Manager took off from here.93/94 was an add-on disk that updated stats to reflect the end of season transfers, offering up precious little in the way of gameplay alterations and a couple of extra background images. Nevertheless, it was considered an essential purchase by fans at the time, kickstarting a yearly release tradition that follows the series to this day.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1586">Total Club Manager 2003</game><game id="15714">Total Club Manager 2005</game><game id="6372">1st Division Manager</game><game id="17359">Championship Manager</game><game id="13605">Emlyn Hughes International Soccer</game><game id="26936">Front Office Football 2007</game><game id="22092">LMA Manager 2007</game><game id="9757">Front Office Football 2001</game><game id="26949">Front Office Football 2004</game><game id="7666">Pro Rugby Manager</game><game id="20837">NFL Head Coach 09</game><game id="5035">NFL Head Coach</game><game id="26951">Front Office Football: The College Years</game><game id="27246">Pro Rugby Manager 2</game><game id="17090">LMA Manager</game><game id="4728">LMA Manager 2001</game><game id="13450">LMA Manager 2002</game><game id="4715">LMA Manager 2003</game><game id="2237">LMA Manager 2004</game><game id="30751">Football Manager 2011</game><game id="6697">Premier Manager Ninety Nine</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17376/562038-250px_cm93_94_box.png</image></root>
