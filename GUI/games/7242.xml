<root><id>7242</id><name>1NSANE</name><description>OverviewDeveloped by  Invictus Games and released by  Codemasters on February 5th, 2005, 1NSANE is an  off-road racing game with virtually no structured  campaign other than a series of scored championship events that unlock new  vehicles, and a heavy focus on multiplayer modes.Levels are set in real-world locations, but are not visually based on real terrain. There are no  licensed vehicles, and you can select anything from light  dune buggies to heavy trucks. The single-player scored campaign is based on  vehicle classes. Game modes range from standard variants of  king of the hill to versions of things like capture the flag where the player with the flag must drive through  checkpoints without being hit by the other players who are trying to steal the  flag. Any of the multiplayer modes can be played single player with  A.I. bots, similar to a multiplayer  shooter or RTS game.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9259">Twisted Metal: Head-On</game><game id="18538">4x4 Evolution</game><game id="21523">UAZ Racing 4x4</game><game id="11346">4x4 Evo 2</game><game id="2825">Screamer 4x4</game><game id="7017">Monster Truck Madness</game><game id="6529">Monster Truck Madness 2</game><game id="37323">Insane 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15228/953367-2insane.jpg</image></root>
