Players could participate in five different modes of play, including Season, MLB Challenge, World Series, and Home Run Derby. The game featured all twenty-eight Major League Baseball teams actively playing at the time of the game's release as well as two expansion teams that had yet to begin play in the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Because the game was unable to obtain the Major League Baseball Players Association license, Ken Griffey Jr. was the only actual player that appeared in the game. All of the other players were given fictitious names along the lines of Muscles McFee, or Big Magoo.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7266">Ken Griffey Jr Presents Major League Baseball</game><game id="11803">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</game><game id="5259">Super Baseball 2020</game><game id="20835">MLB 08: The Show</game><game id="22596">Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</game><game id="5811">Baseball Stars</game><game id="2250">Triple Play 98</game><game id="1202">Triple Play 97</game><game id="17271">Triple Play 2002</game><game id="7000">Triple Play 2001</game><game id="9670">Triple Play Baseball</game><game id="14025">Triple Play 2000</game><game id="22849">Tecmo Super Baseball</game><game id="14051">Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr</game><game id="6736">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</game><game id="25267">Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3</game><game id="37310">Extra Innings</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2225934-ken_griffey__jr._s_winning_run.jpg</image></root>
