They do so by shooting them until they inflate, then by grabbing and throwing them at other onscreen enemies. Hitting multiple enemies in a single throw results in more bonus points, and the screen will end after either all enemies have been destroyed, or after an enemy spawner is destroyed. Each stage has five screens, and every other stage ends with a fight against a durable boss character that can inflate the player character.ReleaseBang Bang Busters was an unreleased prototype originally developed in 1994. In 2011 the specialty publisher Neo Conception International got the rights to the game and made a special run of 100 AES cartridges of the game for the US market. In 2012 they created a Neo Geo CD version of the game for their second print run.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2587">Dig Dug</game><game id="9546">Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
