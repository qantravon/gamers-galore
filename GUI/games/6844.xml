Enduro would start you off each "day" with a specific number of cars you needed to pass in order to qualify you for the next day's race. The concept of changing weather patterns, such as snow and rain as well as a thick fog would drift in and out of the levels force you to handle your car in different ways. When fog came, you moved at a snails pace so not to cause car wrecks, when the weather would clear it would be pedal to the metal. Despite racing being  absolutely nothing like the sport of basketball,  Enduro is frequently suggested to  Game Room players who also enjoy  Double Dunk.Control The game focused on Atari 2600 joystick control and was therefore extremely simplistic by necessity. Left and right would move your car as such, while up and down would act as a change in speed. The real challenge was to not strike cars on any side as your car would slow to a stop and all the cars would pass by, leaving you to start over.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13617">Night Driver</game><game id="2386">Rad Racer</game><game id="18177">Turbo</game><game id="16691">Double Dunk</game><game id="37933">Lemans</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/913/317168-b_enduro_front.jpg</image></root>
