<root><id>2012</id><name>Technic Beat</name><description>Technic Beat is a rhythm action game for the PS2. Unlike many rhythm games of the era that had you simply pressing buttons in time to the music, Technic Beat took a slightly more actiony approach. In each level, you're put in an arena where different sections of the floor would light up in a circular pattern.Â  The player has to maneuver their character to the center of the circle. The game is notable for featuring music from classic Namco games, as well as more traditional fare.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2528">Britney's Dance Beat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2491519-box_tb.png</image></root>
