This was Tecmo's only foray into RPGs in the early nineties, possibly due to it's poor critical reception.  Gameplay  Secret of the Stars Screen  Secret of the Stars has a generic JRPG interface. Most of the game takes place from a top down exploration mode, and when you are on the overworld or in a dungeon, random battles take you to a turn based combat system similar to any of the early Final Fantasies or    Dragon Quests. Secret of the Stars does have two more interesting gameplay elements. Like in some entries in the   Breath of Fire series, Secret of the Stars has the player slowly develop a town in the later parts of the game. Throughout the game, the player also switches between two active parties that have different roles in the story (although there aren't substantial non plot differences between the parties).</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2516">Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom</game><game id="5739">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</game><game id="9249">Chrono Trigger</game><game id="6336">Final Fantasy VI</game><game id="4793">Final Fantasy V</game><game id="20829">Final Fantasy IV</game><game id="20389">The 7th Saga</game><game id="3638">Final Fantasy Mystic Quest</game><game id="19425">Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation</game><game id="22703">Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen</game><game id="7197">Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</game><game id="3093">Breath of Fire II</game><game id="15629">Breath of Fire</game><game id="8307">EarthBound</game><game id="3864">Mother 3</game><game id="3775">Mother 1+2</game><game id="11753">Mother</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364739-snes_secretofthestars.jpg</image></root>
