Humans and aliens alike competed for the Molmoran prize. What set this game apart from other fighters of the time was the inclusion of an RPG game mode, which consisted of 3D dungeon exploration. The dungeon levels consisted of floors and were cleared when the final boss of the floor was beaten. This mode was the only way to unlock playable versions of the 3 bosses in the game.Â  Despite this innovative mode, the big selling point of this game was the inclusion of a Final Fantasy 7 demo disc within each copy of the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15584">Virtua Fighter</game><game id="10081">Tekken</game><game id="721">Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring</game><game id="22887">Vs.</game><game id="15156">Tobal 2</game><game id="6409">Kensei: Sacred Fist</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2284721-box_tobal.png</image></root>
