These missions include blowing up a fuel depot on the Maginot Line, assassinating a Nazi colonel in Paris, marking a U-boat pen for Allied bombers in Hamburg, making her way to a Gestapo prison in Warsaw to find a captured agent, and attempting to assassinate Kamm, a Nazi military intelligence officer.The game's concept, including its stealth action and dark, grim rendition of the Nazi regime, shares similar characteristics with The Saboteur (another game released later that year).GameplayThe game uses techniques similar to other stealth-based games, primarily from the Splinter Cell franchise. Players must hide in the shadows, sneaking around unsuspecting Nazi soldiers and performing silent kills. The heads-up display gives a silhouette of Violette which change color depending on her visibility (the color purple stating that she is hidden in the shadows) and detection (glowing red stating that she has been detected and enemies are seeking out her position).Players can find vests which gives them additional protection, gas masks to protect them in areas with poisonous gas (with the inability to whistle at enemies), Nazi SS uniforms to disguise Violette so she can walk around in open areas (in which her disguise can be compromised by either standing too close to an enemy or by drawing a weapon), and morphine, which slows down time and allows the player to easily get a silent kill.Players gain experience through finding hidden collectibles and secret objectives. Every 1,000 EXP earns you an upgrade star, which you can use to either increase the duration of morphine mode, increase the speed of her sneaking, or increase the amount of damage she can withstand.WeaponsThe silenced Colt M1911.Starting with the second level, players find weapon lockers that contain new weapons and ammo. Players can only carry three weapons at a time (knife, pistol, and shotgun/rifle).Combat Knife - Carried with you throughout the game. Weak in normal attacks.Colt M1911 - Suppressed pistol that's good for stealth kills.P08 Luger - Loud pistol that deals more damage than the M1911.Flare Gun - Pistol that fires single flares, igniting the enemy (either directly or through oil slicks) for an instant kill.Shotgun - Lethal short-distance weapon.G43 Sniper Rifle - Accurate long-distance weapon.STG44 Assault Rifle - Found during the final levels of the game, does tremendous damage in close quarters and good damage in short bursts at longer ranges.MissionsThe LostValleyMission StartEntering Enemy TerritoryAt the Bunker EntranceFuel StorageMission StartEntering the HubGetting the Gas Mask/Gas Mask FoundGetting the ExplosivesIn the Storage/Explosives FoundBlowing Up the Fuel DepotThe EscapeDeath of the ButcherCathedralMission StartOn the BridgeCautious ProceedingsAt the RoadblockEntering the GardenEntering the CathedralCryptMission StartAt the CoffinsAt the TombsEntering the Bell TowerLeave a Light OnDocksMission StartEntering the StorageAt the Reloading PointAt the SubmarinesIn the Fuel Supply AreaIn the Torpedo Supply AreaEntering Inner Harbor AreaStorageMission StartIn the Storehouse AdministrationIn the StorehouseIn the Storage Room for ExplosivesIn the Storage RoomIn the Loading AreaThe BombingThe Third ManSewersMission StartAgent WojzeckBack in the CisternAgent JozefAgent RadekIn the Digester Gas InstallationCombustionGhettoMission StartAt the Ghetto BarrierIn the Ghetto BackyardIn the Labyrinth of FurnitureAt the Gestapo PrisonPrisonMission StartIn the KitchenIn the CanteenIn the Luxury OfficeIn the Torture ChamberFade to GreyLe BoeufMission StartIn the Boathouse CellarOn the Landing StageEntering the InnEntering the BackyardIn the Wine CellarIn the MillBack to the BoatHospitalMission StartCausing TroubleIn the HospitalEntering the BackyardIn the ChapelEntering the GardenIn the WashhouseVillageMission StartBurning CorpsesThe CleansingAt the HarborThe TragedyPC System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows XP / VistaProcessor: Singlecore CPU with 3GHZMemory: 512MB RAMGraphics: Pixel Shader 3 Graphics Card with 256 MB VRAM (Geforce 6800 or ATI X1600)Hard Drive: 5GB Free Hard Disk SpaceSound: Stereo SoundRecommended:OS: Windows XP / VistaProcessor: Dual core CPU with 2GhzMemory: 1GB RAMGraphics: Geforce7900gt or ATI X1900 xtHard Drive: 5GB free Hard Disk SpaceSound: 5.1 Surround Sound</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5961">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</game><game id="457">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent</game><game id="12354">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</game><game id="15549">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</game><game id="16140">Metal Gear Solid</game><game id="6108">Manhunt</game><game id="18082">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</game><game id="20464">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction</game><game id="21616">The Saboteur</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1027521-gb.png</image></root>
