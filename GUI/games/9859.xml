The story spans three decades in the life of Joey Verola, who the player controls as he tries to become a made man in the mafia. The game takes place in New York City, but flashback scenes take place during the Vietnam War, where Joey saves the life of a Don's right hand man, which in turn gives him the opportunity to become an associate with the mafia. The player uses a variety of firearms and is able to slow down time, similar to the popular Max Payne games. A simple cover mechanic is also included, allowing the player to take cover behind objects and attack when the time is right.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2414">Max Payne</game><game id="3547">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</game><game id="8799">El Matador</game><game id="2242">The Punisher</game><game id="20538">Mafia II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1550/272850-mademan_front.jpg</image></root>
