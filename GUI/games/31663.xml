It is set to release exclusively in Japan on June 14, 2010 as a territory-only compliation game, much like North America's release of DJ MAX Fever. Like DJ MAX Portable Clazziquai Edition, Hot Tunes is made with beginner players in mind. While it will still include song favorites from series veterans, the game will have a lowered difficulty at start to allow beginner players to get a better grasp of the game's concept and various play modes.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24517">beatmania</game><game id="9860">Rock Band</game><game id="23011">DrumMania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8124/1398376-psp_djmax_hottunes_frontcover.jpg</image></root>
