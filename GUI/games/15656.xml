The player(s) start on the left-hand side of the screen in the form of blue little men (cops) and have to find their way out of the maze. However, the game comes with many options regarding the mazes' visibility and you can make them partially invisible or even completely invisible with only occasional glances of where you have to go. To increase difficulty, you can add little red men (robbers) to the maze who can briefly knock out the players.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="43301">Go Go Ackman</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367723-a2600_mazecraze.jpg</image></root>
