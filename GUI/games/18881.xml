The game switches from an isometric view on the surface to a more straight-forward view whenever Magmax travels underground.When Magmax finds a piece of the robot, the piece joins onto the ship and provides the player with additional firepower. It will also take a hit and be destroyed in place of the player's ship. Should the player find all the pieces, the Magmax's robotic form is quite formidable in combat and can even changes its main weapon between a laser drill, fireballs and other powerful weapons.The game was Nihon Bussan's first NES title. Nihon Bussan had, at that time, been a minor player in the Arcade market, producing games like Terra Cresta. They would continue producing NES titles for much of the system's lifespan.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17616">Seicross</game><game id="1272">Terra Cresta</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg</image></root>
