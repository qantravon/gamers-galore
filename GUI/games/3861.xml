<root><id>3861</id><name>Gunman Chronicles</name><description>OverviewA sci-fi themed first person shooter from Rewolf Software that pits the player, Major Archer, against his vengeful commanding officer, The General. Despite its futuristic setting the game also features some not-so-subtle influences from the American civil war and Western genre.  Gunman chronicles began its life as a mod for Quake. As it progressed it moved from the Quake engine to the Quake II engine, and eventually on to the GoldSrc (Half-life) engine. Sierra (Half-life's publisher) took note of the mod and gave it a full release in 2000. GameplayThe gameplay of gunman chronicles is similar as the one from Half Life However there is a fully drivable Tank than can be driven during some level sections, sometimes we have to find gasoline cans to make it able to run, the other noticeable gameplay element is the weapon customisation, in fact that's the use of several functions built in the different weapons of the game, the games also manages the temperature on some weapons that forces the player to cease fire to avoid some annoyances due to the overheating.Weapons Name/Description Knife  The knife is the very first weapon in the game, it can do some damage, open some passages and allow to do some melee combat if we are out of ammo, this weapon isn't recommended for use since most enemies are dangerous at point blank range, but some enemies can be killed with Alternate mode: This weapon features an alternate mode which consists to use our fists, the fists are faster than the knife but does less damageBlasterThis is the first ranged weapon in the game, it use cells and has some versatility do to this, it can shoot 4 kind of projectiles (the last is acquired through the sniper upgrade) second the selected modes, this weapon is moderately effective, the beams are effective against fast moving targets and the plasma balls more effective against slow moving ones or simply to create a "barrage" Alternate modes: The weapon by default features 3 alternate modes Pulse shoot beams (moderate ROF, moderate damage, 3 cells bursts and very accurate) Rapid shoots plasma balls (very fast, powerful and inaccurate)Charge fires an explosive plasma ball (uses 10 cells) When upgraded it has a fourth mode Sniper (variable second how much time we maintained the fire button)The sniper mode is the one of the most powerful modes on this weapon which imitates a railgun since we can line up enemies and kill/damage them with a single shot, however it uses 20 ammo when fully charged and to adjust the scope we have to use the scroll to do so. We need to find one of those boxes shown in the right picture to be able to use the sniper mode of the blaster otherwise only the three firsts modes are available  Shotgun  The shotgun features several modes in two categories like ammo used per shot and the spread, it's a good shotgun, but the ideal is using two shells and if we are good at aiming using the rifle spread, we can hit our targets more efficiently at longer ranges even if the range is limited, this weapon can also create a devastating barrage of pellets since we can use the riot spread and 4 cartridges per shot, but be careful, more shells the gun shoots at once, slower the weapon can fire Alternate modes The weapon features 3 kind of spread pattern ShotRiotgunShotgunRifleThe cartridges goes from 1 up to 4 cartridges at once Shells 1234This weapon is mainly a spread gun and second the enemies we fight certain settings are ideal   Mecha Gun  The Mecha Gun is a machine gune that contains two modes, this weapon can do massive damage in a few seconds, the only inconvenient is the fact that it overheats, that overhating can be an advantage, because when the weapon have an high temperature, the bullets does more damage, plus if it enters in malfunction if the gun is overheated, the gun fires faster during some seconds or until the weapon's supply is depleted. The overheating is truly useful against though enemies since the weapon fire a lot of bullets very fast with full power.Alternate mode This weapon have two barrels that can rotate, the rotation allows the weapon to fire faster, but the temperature is gained faster as well The weapon can be upgraded with a cooling upgrade it adds a ventilation to the barrels to reduces the chances of overheating it's shown on the picture two at right Polaris Blade (Beam gun)   This weapon is a lightining gun, it's versatile and flexible, it can fire continous lightning bolts at various ranges and voltages, it has also some functions like firing powerful balls, this weapon can overheat, but unlike the mecha gun, it damages us, and disallow to fire the weapon until it's at reasonable temperature to work again Alternate modesPower, the voltage can be set to high, medium or low and the amount of damage follows the power select, but more the voltage is high more the weapon can be hot quickly also the accuracy decreases when the power is high.LowMediumHigh Range, the range can be set to touch taser up to long, this also affects the ammo consumption and the heat generated Touch taserShort beamMedium beamLong beam Lighting, this function can vary between 3 settings Beam (default mode and the most usefulChain (powerful)Ball (dangerous and generates a huge amount of heat)The ball mode has to be used with extreme precaution, so be careful with it can be devastating, but can return its power against the user Chemical gun  The chemical gun is a particular weapon since second how we customize it, it can affect one type of creature more efficiently it can also become a chemical grenade launcher, it share a few similarities with the Unreal 1 Ges Biorifle, but overall it's a different weapon. The projectiles can explode upon impact, stick against walls, bounce, this weapon is dangerous at short range and second the amount basic or acid solution, the weapon is more effective against mechs or Xenomes, the Neutral is here to "stabilize" the mixture Weapon configurations, they are all stepped in 4 levelsBasicNeutralAcidPressureThe pressure allows to throw the projectile further or at closer range, also a lot of pressure reduces the rate of fire and generates more recoil MULE Multiple Unit Launch Engine  The Mule is a rocket launcher, it can fire one or two rockets at once, it posses also a lot of functions compared to the other weapons, and second the modes we can set traps, launch laser guided missiles, heat seeking missiles, grenades even if that's more bouncing rockets (the rockets when they hit something, they act like grenades, they doesn't make ricochets) the weapon does a lot of damage and allow several tactics, but beware, if the weapon is totally empty, you should pop the weapon up to make it reloads the rockets to be able to take more rockets, the weapon has 2 rockets loaded 6 in the storage Alternate modes Fired modes when targeted (allow to launch the rockets only when having a target lockedwhen fired Flightpath modes Guided(uses a laser to guide the rocket)HomingSpiral Fuse modes ImpactTimedProximityWhen Tripped Payload ExplosiveClusterGrenades (MULE) rockets  The grenades are rocket core warheads, they can be used as grenades or mines it's a versatile explosive grenade, but not very useful when we have the MULE, but ideal to shot around corners Alternate modes Fuse modes TimedImpactWhen Tripped (laser mine mode) Payload ExplosiveClusterThe laser Trigger allow us to use the grenade as a laser triggered mine, we need to be close to a wall to be able to set up the mine, also never leave the grenade with this mode, because if we want to fight with the grenade is unusable the best setting is impact with your favorite payload, the timed mode is useful to shoot around corners.  VehicleIn gunman chronicles we can drive one vehicle, this is a Tank, it has several functions second we use the crouch button and the two fire buttons It has a mortar, a rocket and two machineguns</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16508">Half-Life: Opposing Force</game><game id="7814">Half-Life: Blue Shift</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2299677-gunman_chronicles.jpg</image></root>
