<root><id>36645</id><name>Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Universe Accel/Cosmic Drive</name><description>OverviewMobile Suit Gundam AGE is a              PlayStation Portable Action RPG developed by             Level-5 and published by            Namco Bandai. It is based on the anime of the same name, though the anime itself was born from initial discussion between Level-5's    Akihiro Hino and anime giant Sunrise. The game will be similar to Level-5's           Cardboard Senki, featuring customizable, super-deformed robots that battle in three-dimensional arenas. Gundam AGE is split into two versions: Universe Accel and Cosmic Drive. Universe Accel features Mobile Suits and cameos from  Gundam's Universal Century universe, while Cosmic Drive features extras from   Gundam SEED's Cosmic Era and Gundam 00's alternate Anno Domini timelines. Gundam AGE's story unfolds over 100 years and stars          Flit Asuno, his son         Asemu Asuno, and his grandson        Kio Asuno. The three Asuno males fight against the mysterious "Unknown Enemy" using the powerful Mobile Suits known as "Gundams."    In addition to the main story, there will be miscellaneous "Quests." For these missions, players create their own avatar instead of using one of the Asuno pilots. Up to three players can participate in a Quest.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23915">Danbol Senki</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/2211165-gundamageuacd.jpg</image></root>
