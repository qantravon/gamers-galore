It's gameplay revolves around attacking rats that are spreading throughout the level. You must avoid traps and dogs to kill the rats and clear the stage. There are many power ups in the game such as invincibilty and the ability to freeze fleeing rats. The game was not a particular hit for either platform, but still is very unique in premise.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9261/384477-rat_attack__pal___front_.jpg</image></root>
