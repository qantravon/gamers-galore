A variation of SRW Alpha 2's and Alpha 3's Squad System, this allows two robots to combine into a single team (represented by one unit on the map).Unlike the Super Robot Wars Alpha series, teams can be formed on the map at will. Twin Command Spirit Commands (seishin) can only be used while in a team. They use SP from both team members. When fighting a single enemy unit, both team members attack the enemy (somewhat similar to Super Robot Wars Impact's and MX's Command Attack). When fighting an enemy team, the main unit attacks the enemy main, while the sub unit fights the enemy sub. ALLW Attacks, a combination of the Alphas' ALL Attack and MX's Double Attack, allows a unit to attack all members in two adjacent teams. Seperate teams can perform Support Attack with each other.  Ace Bonuses. Each pilot gains a bonus skill when they reach 50 kills. Later appears in Super Robot Wars A Portable.Special Ammo. There are items in the game that allows the player to modify certain stats on equippable weapons.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3731">Phantom Brave</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12421/391762-srog02.jpg</image></root>
