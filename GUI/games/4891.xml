It introduced two new characters with Brad, a kickboxer specialist, and Goh, a specialist of martial arts grappling. Along with a new Quest mode of traveling to various spots of Japan against CPU-controlled VF players, the character customization is beefed up as well. Other than the new characters, all of VF4's cast return with some changes to their move lists. Another bonus feature is the original Virtua Fighter playable on the disc and all characters are playable in their sprites other than the original cast.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7792">Dead or Alive 4</game><game id="2895">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</game><game id="20678">Soulcalibur IV</game><game id="14684">Tekken 4</game><game id="22292">Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore</game><game id="3744">Def Jam: Fight for NY</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="13753">Dead or Alive Ultimate</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="9855">Soulcalibur III</game><game id="5206">Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</game><game id="18753">Tekken 5</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1791110-box_vf4e.png</image></root>
