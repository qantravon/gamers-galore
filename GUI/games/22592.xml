It is a remake of         Super Robot Wars Compact 2 Earth Crisis,        Cosmoquake, and       Galaxy Showdown, all of which were originally released for the Bandai Wonderswan. Battles take place on fully-3d maps, while combat sequences are animated using      Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden's engine. Â The game follows     Kyosuke Nanbu,    Excellen Browning and their teammates as they battle various factions, including the alien Einsts. The first chapter features Kyosuke and the Earth team led by Dancougar's Kotaru Hazuki, while the second chapter features Excellen and the space team led by  Gundam's   Bright Noa. The teams unite in the third and final chapter.
