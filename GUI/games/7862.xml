Development first started on the PlayStation port, and then a Sega Saturn programmer coming on board to work on a port. With the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn having very different hardware, it was decided that the Sega Saturn would not be able to run the game at a decent frame rate and on February 1996 was canceled.Work on porting the two main engines proved difficult, with the art engine needing to be completely re-done and all of the art assets having to be re-created especially for the PlayStation version. The enemies and objects in the game eventually had to be re-drawn as sprites rather than the 3D objects on the PC version as the PlayStation did not have enough memory to make them work.The new graphics that were shown to the games publisher, Philips Interactive, which in turn did not like the end result. This is what eventually led to the game getting cancelled, as the PlayStation version of the game could not be made to look exactly like the PC version.The PlayStation port contained working support for the dual analog flight controller, the negCon, and the PlayStation mouse.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2214776-cover.jpg</image></root>
