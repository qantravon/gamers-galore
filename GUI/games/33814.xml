<root><id>33814</id><name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name><description>OverviewThe Violinist of Hameln is an action platformer developed by Daft and published by Enix for the Super Famicom platform.Loosely based off some of the earlier chapters of the manga series Hameln no Violin Hiki, this amusing action platformer covers the adventures of Hamel and Flute up to the point where they first encounter Sizer. The game's sound track features a number of famous pieces of classical music (eg. Mozart's symphony number 25 in G minor).The Violinist of Hameln was released in Japan on September 29, 1995 and it was never brought to any other country. An unofficial English translation patch was released by J2e Translations on January 21, 2001.GameplayThe player controls Hamel, accompanied by Oboe and Flute. Hamel moves around the levels via jumping and gliding with the use of a cape. Combat consists of musical note attacks that corespond to directional pad inputs. In addition, Hamel must interact with Flute to solve the many puzzles along the way. The player can pick up Flute and throw her as a projectile or can force her to dress in a variety of silly humiliating costumes that have special abilities. The various costumes (assigned via a pause screen) have special abilities: the ostrich costume can walk over spikes, the frog costume jumps extremely high, the curling iron slides along the ground and quickly decimates enemies. When thrown, Flute can break various types of stone obstacles that are otherwise indestructible. Any enemies struck by Flute generate coins when destroyed, so throwing Flute is a good way to build up money generating anywhere from zero to five coins based on how much damage she has absorbed.Flute is technically invincible, but If the player gets Flute to the end of the stage unharmed they are awarded a bonus of two stars. The player can make Flute stay in place briefly and then call her to catch up with Oboe. If Flute ever falls in to a pit, Oboe will rescue her, but the player will not receive the star bonus for the stage.ItemsThere are a wide variety of items to be found in the game, some items are found in the world and som must be purchased.Star: Get four of these in a stage to go to a bonus stage after crossing the goal.Music Note: Increases Hamel's attack power by one level.Fruit: Restores one point to Hamel's life gauge.Mysterious fruit: Completely refills Hamel's life gauge.Hat: An extra life.Coin: There are coins worth 1, 5, 10, and 50 coins per pickup.Hourglass: Adds more time to the timer.Key: Needed to open locked doors.Heart: Extends Hamel's life gauge by one point.Magic Wallet: Can only be purchased in town.
