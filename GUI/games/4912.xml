It was only released in Japan on July 31, 1989 for the Famicom. The game was developed and published by Namco. Unlike the first Splatterhouse, Wanpaku Graffiti had "super-deformed" characters, probably due to the hardware of the Famicom. The game is a prequel to Splatterhouse. In Wanpaku Graffiti, the player takes on the role of Rick as he hunts the evil Pumpkin King though seven levels of gameplay.GameplayWanpaku Graffiti is a beat-'em-up, just like the other games in the Splatterhouse franchise. Despite the game's "cuter" tone, there is still gore (as with other games in the franchise). Rick fights his way through seven levels, filled with a variety of enemies. Wanpaku Graffiti also has a level system. The higher the level, the larger the life bar is. Wanpaku Graffiti also contains numerous references to horror movies such as Alien, The Exorcist, Jaws, and Friday the 13th.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30926">Splatter Master</game><game id="6377">SD Snatcher</game><game id="1913">Kid Dracula</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362251-nes_splatterhousewanpakugraffiti_jp.jpg</image></root>
