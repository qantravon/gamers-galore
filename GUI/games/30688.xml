It was later ported to the      Neo Geo AES and the     Neo Geo CD. The game is set in an imaginary American football season around the early 1990s with ten fictional teams. Football Frenzy is shown from an overhead perspective with the end zones on the left and right sides, and it plays with highly simplified controls. It was the only football game released for the Neo Geo.  Gameplay      Football Frenzy can be played by one or two players. Characters movements are controlled with an eight-way joystick. Actions like hiking the ball, kicking, and speeding up the player's run are all controlled by the A button; the B,C,and D buttons pass the ball to other characters who are designated by those buttons. Players select a play from a wide selection of running, passing, or kicking plays, which are then executed with help from the AI. Just like regular football, the offensive team attempts to take the ball to their opponent's end zone, while the defensive team guards their end zone and attempts to take over control of the ball. The player with the most points after a set time period wins.   </description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11229">Tecmo Bowl</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26740/1326990-582038_86395_front.jpg</image></root>
