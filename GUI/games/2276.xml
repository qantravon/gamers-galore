<root><id>2276</id><name>Mouse Trap</name><description>Mouse Trap is virtually identical to Pac-Man, though it does have a couple of variations. The player is a mouse, attempting to eat all of the cheese on the board before being caught by the cats that roam the maze. On collecting special power pellets, which would immediately render Pac-Man invincible, the player can choose to store the power-up until needed. When activated, the power-up turns the mouse into a dog for a limited time, who can then chase and eat the cats. However, a hawk will randomly swoop down onto the board in an attempt to kill the mouse. The hawk will kill the mouse, even if it is in "dog mode."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="19552">Pac-Man: Championship Edition</game><game id="17187">Lady Bug</game><game id="4559">K.C.
