You pilot a jumping tank while you explore underground caverns and battle hostile robotic enemies. Occasionally you'll need to leave your vehicle to explore rooms you can only get to on foot. Gameplay switches from 3rd person to FPS as you search for powerful upgrades you'll need to reach new areas.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/2285390-helenaboxart.1.png</image></root>
