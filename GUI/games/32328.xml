The mod combined gameplay features from various games such as Quake or Unreal Tournament. Features such as Jetpacks, Weapon Damage, and Jump Height all lead to face paced action within the mod itself. In order to separate itself from the large amount of other "face-paced" action mods, the developers also brought in ideas from games such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. Implemented features such as aiming down sights aided in creating both a tactical and fast paced mod which in hand also created a large fan base towards Orion.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17448">Unreal Tournament</game><game id="8015">Quake</game><game id="11339">Counter-Strike: Source</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19088/1466173-prelude01.png</image></root>
