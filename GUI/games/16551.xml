A Sega Genesis version was released only in Japan on Sega MegaNet and in compilations. The title comes from a song released in 1985 entitled Teddy Boy Blues and was performed by Yohko Ishino.Connections to Alex KiddTeddy has a few strange connections with SEGA's original mascot Alex Kidd. First, an enemy that appeared originally in Teddy Boy later appeared in Alex Kidd in Miracle World. The left image is from Teddy Boy and on the right is from Alex Kidd in Miracle World. This enemy is a daruma which is a popular Japanese Buddhist symbol.A secret screen found in the game QuartetAnother connection occurred in the Sega Master System port of the 1986 arcade game Quartet (also known as Double Target). A hidden screen within the game contain Mary, one of the game's heroes, as well as Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone, the main character from Pit-Pot, Alex Kidd and Teddy Boy.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9101">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363096-sms_teddyboy_au.jpg</image></root>
