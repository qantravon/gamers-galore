<root><id>4102</id><name>Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</name><description>Campaign The campaign is divided up among the dynasties that have ruled China, the challenge increasing correspondingly as you serve the different dynasties: Xia Dynasty 2070 – 1600 BC (tutorial campaign) Shang Dynasty 1600-1046 BC Zhou Dynasty 1046-221 BC Qin Dynasty 221-206 BC Han Dynasty 206 BC – 220 AD Sui-Tang Dynasty 581 – 907 AD Song Jin Dynasty 960 – 1234 AD The game also offers a sandbox mode in which there are no objectives to be fulfilled. Religion Like other city-building games by Impressions, Emperor requires you to pay homage to your people's religious figures. In the early years, the Ancestors will be the sole focus of your people's religion, but as the game progresses Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism will appear as well, along with some of their major figures, including Confucius himself. City Interaction Emperor allows you to interact with other major cities in China (and later Tibet and Korea as well). Interaction includes trade, espionage, pacts and warfare. It is possible to occupy other cities for tribute, either in cash or resources specific to their area. Some missions will require you to control multiple cities to complete your objectives. Conversely, you can also be occupied by a rival city if they defeat your defending forces. This will not end the mission, but refusal to pay tribute will spark another invasion which, if successful, will permanently remove you from power. Warfare During the campaign you will have to face rival Chinese cities, Xiongnu and Mongols, among others, on the battlefield. If you are defending your own city, you will be allowed full control of your forces to repel the invasion. If you are on the offensive, you cannot control the battle and the result will be reported to you. The religious figures mentioned above can be summoned to participate either in the defense or the offensive, if their favour is high enough. Multiplayer Emperor was the first city-building game to offer multiplayer possibilities.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="2859">Cultures: Die Saga</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="2815">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="9828">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire – The Eastern Realm</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="4820">Dungeon Keeper 2</game><game id="32175">Dungeon Keeper 3</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="31820">Majesty 2: Pocket Kingdom</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/59193/1135656-2000299366675881810_rs.jpg</image></root>
