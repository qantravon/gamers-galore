<root><id>41535</id><name>Daylight</name><description>OverviewPlayers will play as a female protagonist, who has awoken in a randomly generated abandoned hospital. She has no idea why she's in the hospital, but is trying to find out why via notes, documents and possessed messages that find their way to her cell phone. Her phone acts as a flashlight, as well as a UV light to follow her footprints should she get lost. There is no real combat, when she comes across a phantom, she must either run, or scare it away with a flare. One play through is meant to only last around 30 minutes, but the game is meant to be played multiple times to get the whole story. More content is planned after the games release.External linksOfficial site: http://www.playdaylight.com/</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20465">Condemned 2: Bloodshot</game><game id="8804">Condemned: Criminal Origins</game><game id="40089">Outlast</game><game id="3346">Penumbra: Black Plague</game><game id="30087">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56742/2429949-daylightwhitetrns1jpg_9f1140.jpg</image></root>
