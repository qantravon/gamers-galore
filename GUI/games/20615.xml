The humans use summoning magic and are at war with the Kascuza, a race of elf life humanoids. The magic starts to upset the spirits of the land and the world begins unraveling. It's up to your party to find the cause and stop it from happening.GameplayThe game employs the stylus and touch-screen exclusively. It's a sort of "point and tap" dungeon crawler. You tap on the enemies to attack them, tap on special panels for special attacks, summons, and items. This even extends to the menu systems.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9471">Children of Mana</game><game id="7060">Lunar Knights</game><game id="24233">Iron Feather</game><game id="22044">From the Abyss</game><game id="21633">Soma Bringer</game><game id="24226">Legacy of Ys: Books I &amp; II</game><game id="23977">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time</game><game id="22015">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</game><game id="21448">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</game><game id="21371">Avalon Code</game><game id="24225">Destiny Links</game><game id="27893">Cross Treasures</game><game id="25152">Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow</game><game id="29232">Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478694-box_snta.png</image></root>
