Now he's the star of a five episode comedy series, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People. With all new storylines co-written by the guys from Homestarrunner.com, you'll feel like you're inside Strong Bad's world. (You may even start to talk like him!) Each episode has a different theme and you get to hang out with with Homestar, The Cheat, Bubs the whole crew. It's like a Strong Bad cartoon on steroids.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8696-1.jpg</image></root>
