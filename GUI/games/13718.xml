A girl named Pepper and her dog Lockjaw are transported from the present day to Philadelphia in 1764. Most of the game centers around helping Benjamin Franklin and learning about his writings and scientific experiments.The game uses Sierra's traditional point-and-click SCI adventure game engine. A new addition to the interface was the addition of Lockjaw the dog as a playable character. Lockjaw's interaction modes include the ability to smell objects and/or bite them.System requirementsMS-DOS 3.3 or Windows 3.1 or greater286 processor2 MB RAM9 MB Hard drive spaceVGASoundBlaster, AdLib, Roland MT-32/LAPC-1/CM-32L/CM-64 or General MIDIMouse</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16705">Quarky &amp; Quaysoo's Turbo Science</game><game id="18014">Castle of Dr. Brain</game><game id="10134">EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus</game><game id="1668">Slater &amp; Charlie Go Camping</game><game id="18998">EcoQuest 2: Lost Secret of the Rainforest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/1393557-peppers_adventures_in_time_discovery_a.jpg</image></root>
