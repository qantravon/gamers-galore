The game is known for its steep learning curve as the player must track unit loses at an individual level. Nearly every unit in the game is based upon historical counterparts that actually fought in the Pacific War. It is possible for an individual to manage their armies and auxiliary units at the battalion and squadron level. Individual units have unique pros and cons when on campaign with the day/night cycle having dire consequences for certain units. Both land and air units can be broken up into sub units and reconstituted when necessary.The player can decide whether his units (land, air and sea) attack enemy forces, infrastructure or civilian morale. If incendiary bombs are dropped on industrial centres there is a possibility of it igniting a large scale fire that remains until subdued by either the individual or computer. The Japanese faction can employ Kamikaze tactics after the American offensives of 1944 begin.Much like other WW2 strategy games, military commanders all have different skills that play into the placement of officers. The user interface is designed in such a fashion as to allow the player the freedom to adjust the complexity of both the unit and resource management.War in the Pacific: The Struggle Against Japan 1941-1945 features 15 campaigns and multiplayer via email. Each turn represents the passage of 12 hours and is broken up into 1 or 7 phases depending on individual choice. Each game takes place between December 7th 1941 to June 30th 1946.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14505">Uncommon Valor: Campaign for the South Pacific</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/805656-944245_20080521_screen005.jpg</image></root>
