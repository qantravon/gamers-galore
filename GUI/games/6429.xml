As in the first game, Beach Head II is divided into several game sequences (mini-games) in which both sides fight over thel ife of  kidnapped  hostages. While the allies' goal is to protect and save the hostages, the dictator's interests are rather more severe in their designs and he will try to eliminate the allied forces or the   hostages, which results in a much more grizzly experience should one opt to play the dictator. The mini-games all follow similar formulas and resemble classic arcade shooters and shoot-em ups.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="1214">Beach Head 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/623430-beach_head_2_1_.jpg</image></root>
