This NES/SNES/GB/GG incarnation of Chessmaster drops the 2000 from the original's name. It allows players to view the board from a 2D or 3D perspective, to select between the classic Staunton chess pieces or with fantasy-themed pieces (similar to those used in Battle Chess) as well as several other options to customize play. Tutorials are available, as are move hints and a second player mode.This version of Chessmaster should not be mistaken for the other entries in the series, of which there are over a dozen.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3036">Archon: The Light and the Dark</game><game id="19195">Chessmaster 10th Edition</game><game id="20077">Battle Chess</game><game id="4342">Online Chess Kingdoms</game><game id="16214">The Fidelity Ultimate Chess Challenge</game><game id="14771">Virtual Chess 64</game><game id="11488">Learn To Play Chess with Fritz &amp; Chesster</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371414-chessmaster_fr_ntsc.png</image></root>
