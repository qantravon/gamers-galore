Unlike many similar shoot 'em up titles of its time, however, Overkill features a branching path upgrade system for the player's ship and weapons, as well as giving the player several shield bars that all have to be depleted before losing a life. While taking a shot removes small increments of life, colliding with an enemy ship instantly depletes a full layer of the player's shield.Release historyOverkill was originally released in 1992 as shareware. On the 23rd of July of 2008, the registered version was declared to be freeware by the game's maker, Ste Cork.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20755">19XX: The War Against Destiny</game><game id="16253">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</game><game id="6784">Tyrian 2000</game><game id="5612">Highway Hunter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/127673/2000956-ok01.png</image></root>
