Throughout the level Doc Clock comes across basic items such as wheels, seats, wooden blocks and steering wheels. Using his robot sidekick Sack he is able to attach items with each other in anyway, similar to the creation tools in Garry's Mod. Using this allows Doc Clock to create bridges, vehicles, ladders and Rube-Goldberg machines to destroy evil robots. Attachment is very simple and doesn't require proper connection, as long as they are connected in some way they will work as intended.Time travel also plays apart in Doc Clock. Using the 'time slider' the player is able to rewind time to correct mistakes. You are able to rewind to the very beginning of level and the ability to use the slider is unlimited.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7Processor: AMD/Pentium 2.0 GhzRAM Memory: 256mbGraphics Card: 64mb GeForce 4 Ti or ATI equivilentDirectXÂ®: 9.0cHard Drive Space: 300mbSound Card: Soundblaster compatibleMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: Any IntelRAM Memory: 256mbGraphics Card: 64mb Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti or ATI equivalentHard Drive Space: 300mb</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35173">Tesla: The Weather Man</game><game id="20617">Garry's Mod</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/1835947-doc_clock___the_toasted_sandwich_of_time.jpg</image></root>
