<root><id>39782</id><name>Dragon Scroll</name><description>OverviewDragon Scroll: Yomigaerishi Maryuu ("Dragon Scroll: Resurrection of the Demon Dragon") is an action RPG created by Konami. As the subtitle suggests, an evil dragon has been revived from its ancient slumber and the protagonist must stop it at any cost. The protagonist is actually a good golden dragon, similarly roused from a centuries-long sleep, who transforms into a human being in order to track down the culprits responsible for the demon dragon's awakening.The game is very similar to the Legend of Zelda, at least in terms of gameplay. The player must walk around various screens with a top-down view, gathering information and exploring dungeons for useful items. The protagonist is able to level-up and become stronger by finding better equipment. Most information is gathered from particularly talkative enemies who regale the hero with gossip and hints just after being destroyed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2323251-dragon_scroll_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
