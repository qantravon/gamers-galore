Your goal was to gather 5 cristals scattered all over the game world. The game introduced the notions of backtracking, using potions to heal yourself and losing health when hit by an enemy (as opposed to instant death). The only type of enemy in the game were ghosts and you had to travel through jungles, mansions, pyramids and other varied locales to find your cristals.    </description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17856">Manic Miner</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2134162-cover.jpg</image></root>
