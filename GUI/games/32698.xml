The protagonist starts as a lowly prinny trainer, content to live his life obsessing over sardines. When the "corruptorment" calls for the destruction of all the prinnies due to a lack of space in the Netherworld, the protagonist takes offense as he promised each prinny a single sardine for graduating and soon sees the safety of the prinnies as his responsibility. With the help of his loyal aide Fenrich, the dubious help of prison warden Axel, an "unprinny" girl from Earth, and a wannabe End Boss, he fights back against the corruptorment and the forces behind its unusual recent acts.As in prior games of the series, Disgaea 4 is a strategy roleplaying game. The main quest takes the player through dozens of dungeon levels, seperated into groups. These levels can all be played repeatedly to grind out levels or obtain better loot. The player can utilize up to ten characters per dungeon, selectable through a home base. These characters range from warriors, mages, and thieves to prinnies (the series' penguin-like mascot of sorts), dragons, and mushrooms. Each character can be reincarnated, and with the exception of the main characters, can take on new roles to learn more skills.The game also features the Item World, a series of randomized dungeons that can increase the stats of any item in your inventory. The Item World can have up to 100 levels per item, and the player must fight through 10 levels of the dungeon in order to escape or return home, unless the player uses a special item that allows them to escape the dungeon early.The game (and series) features power leveling. Any character can become up to level 9999. This is purely optional, as the main quest won't require you to level nearly that much. The game basically allows the player the amount of depth that he or she chooses. Ripping through the main quest will require some grinding, but not nearly as much if they choose to complete the Item World or seek out the optional dungeons.The developers of Disgaea 4 stated that the game will be a "huge evolution" in the graphics department, when compared to the previous entries in the Disgaea Franchise.GameplayThe gameplay is very similar to the previous Disgaea games, but a few notable features have been added or changed.The Dark Assembly is now the Senate.
