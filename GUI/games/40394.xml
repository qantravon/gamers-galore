<root><id>40394</id><name>Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi</name><description>OverviewJaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi (also known as Jaaman Tanteidan Marine Kumi: Maruhi Jigoma Sousa File) is an adventure game from Bandai that uses the license of a TV show that was also the basis of Bandai's earlier action game Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi: Matenrou no Chousenjou. Both games feature teams of schoolchildren detectives as they hunt down an elusive thief in a mask and cape.The game follows a sub-genre of Japanese adventure games that include a top-down RPG style world map to walk around on, rather than simply selecting destinations from a menu. Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39942">Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi: Matenrou no Chousenjou</game><game id="38808">Kieta Princess</game><game id="39511">Mito Koumon</game><game id="39605">Kyonshiizu 2</game><game id="39961">Be-Bop High School: Koukousei Gokuraku Densetsu</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360448-jaaman_tanteidan_fds.jpg</image></root>
