It is also part of the Compati Hero Series, which re-imagines Gundam, Ultraman and Kamen Rider characters as super deformed (SD) versions of relative sizes. This was so the immensely tall Gundam and Ultraman characters could fight alongside human-sized Kamen Rider characters.Last Fighter Twin departs from SD Great Battle's top-down action gameplay with a side-scrolling brawler format.</description><genres><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40740">Ultraman</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48222/1287135-570831_9393_front.jpg</image></root>
