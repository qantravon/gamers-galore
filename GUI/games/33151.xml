Aside from the addition of trophies, the ability to run at a higher resolution, and the ability to run at sixty frames per second, the contents of the game are otherwise nearly identical. However, the game does not contain the original Wii version's "Murasame Castle" mode, which is based on an old Nintendo property and was produced in partnership with Nintendo.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27210">Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes</game><game id="37103">Sengoku Basara 3 Utage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31223/1678288-2132437146_full.jpg</image></root>
