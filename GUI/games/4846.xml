Each officer posesses weapons and equipment that can be used to perform their duties and abilities. The game has a co-op mode which allowed players to assume each a role in the party.  The option only works in a LAN setting. Brent Spiner voices his role of Data in the game, providing the team with mission briefings and updates.     </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10537">Jagged Alliance</game><game id="884">Jagged Alliance 2</game><game id="12328">Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines</game><game id="10756">Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2263939-statboxart.jpg</image></root>
