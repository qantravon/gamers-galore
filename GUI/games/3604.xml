<root><id>3604</id><name>Adventures of Dino-Riki</name><description>OverviewAdventures of DinoRiki is a ground-based vertical shoot-em-up where the player controls the titular caveman DinoRiki as he fights waves of enemies. Though the game was developed by Hudson (and published by same for the US release), it was actually produced in Japan by the short-lived publisher Rix Soft - a software branch of Japanese precision measuring equipment and electronics manufacturer Ricoh Elemex Corp. This would be the only game Rix Soft would ever be involved in.GameplayPlayers have full control over DinoRiki's movement, allowing both horizontal and vertical movement. However, because he is stuck on the ground, the player has to be careful to walk DinoRiki around obstacles that would impede his progress while simultaneously taking down the waves of enemies that fly in constantly.DinoRiki can often find power-ups by defeating enemies and destroying smaller obstacles in his path, such as plants. These will increase his firepower (turning his basic weapon into powerful axes and boomerangs - common weapons for Hudson protagonists) and speed as well as replenish his health (unlike many shoot-em-up protagonists, DinoRiki can take several hits before dying) and increase the player's score.A difficult aspect of this game is avoiding instant death traps like large bodies of water, which need to be jumped over, and getting caught by the constantly scrolling screen.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15361">Gun.Smoke</game><game id="12664">Elemental Master</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371420-adventures_of_dino_riki_fr_ntsc.png</image></root>
