As their doom draws ever closer, Sam reminds Max of how they got there in the first place. The living dead are running amok in the streets, but it's not until a zombie makes of with the treasured hand of Jessie James that the duo get involved.  Their detective skills show them to a mysterious castle in Stuttgart, Germany. After tricking their way past Agent Superball yet again they enter the castle, which turns out to be a rave host by an emo vampire named Jurgan. Jurgan explains that the zombies are attracted to his "incomparible style", so Sam and Max set up a series of events to make Jurgan seem less hip. After Jurgan storms off the two confront him in his room, only to be trapped in the device they were in at the beginning. Before the can escape though, they are killed and turn into zombies themselves. But even death can't stop Sam and Max, and the pair eventually return to life with the help of the Frankenstein-like monster created by Jurgan. The pair confront the vampire again and this time emerge victorious. But before the episode ends their neighbour, Flint Paper, busts in and tells them Bosco has gone missing.  PC Requirements Operating System: Microsoft® Windows® XP/VistaProcessor: 2.0 Ghz or better (3 GHz Pentium® 4 or equivalent recommended)Memory: 512 MB RAM (1GB recommended)Hard Disk Space: 310 MBVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX® 8.1 compliant video card (128 MB recommended)Sound Card: DirectX® 8.1 sound deviceDirectX® Version: DirectX® Version 9.0c or better (DirectX updater included)Controller Support: Yes    No internet connection required to play         </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21670">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 1: Fright of the Bumblebees</game><game id="25467">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 2: The Last Resort</game><game id="14596">Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit</game><game id="25469">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 4: The Bogey Man</game><game id="25468">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 3: Muzzled</game><game id="10528">Monkey Island 2:  LeChuck's Revenge</game><game id="3019">The Secret of Monkey Island</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1156/274111-header.jpg</image></root>
