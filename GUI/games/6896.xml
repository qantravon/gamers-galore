Additionally, the player was able to produce incredibly voracious, hardy animals with extremely high birth rates, which would quickly multiply beyond control, devouring the biomass of the planet (both animal and plant alike), and would then turn on their own as cannibals, leaving behind nothing but a barren rock of a world from what was once a verdent eden.It is highly likely that SimLife, SimAnt, and SimEarth's development culminated in the design of Spore, as Spore contains elements of all three titles in its gameplay.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15236">SimAnt: The Electronic Ant Colony</game><game id="6804">SimSafari</game><game id="250">SimEarth: The Living Planet</game><game id="6802">SimTown</game><game id="27575">L.O.L.: Lack of Love</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/917706-simlife1.jpg</image></root>
