<root><id>9068</id><name>Eskimo Games</name><description>Despite sharing the same name as similar, more conservative renderings of tournament games (     Summer Games,     Winter Games etc.), Eskimo Games is really a collection of a few mini games which generally reward a quick and eye and swift hand. A    snowball fight, serving   ice cream, fighting a  polar bear and so forth. The graphics are deliberately cartoonish and the games are easy to pick up and master.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7912">Tapper</game><game id="17744">Caveman Ugh-Lympics</game><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="24113">Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force</game><game id="30058">Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert's Revenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1454162-515_1.jpg</image></root>
