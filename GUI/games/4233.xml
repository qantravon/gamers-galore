<root><id>4233</id><name>Rocket Ranger</name><description>One of the first superhero games. It draws its inspiration from movies like  TheÂ Rocketeer. The game is interesting for it's movie approach with lots of cut-scenes. Although the story refers to       aliens from      the Moon who have     invaded the    Earth in the far-off future year of 1996, the enemies were clearly intended to be         Nazis, with red banners draped over their installations, distinctive metal helmets on their soldiers, and leaders hiding in aerial          Zeppelin bases.
