<root><id>35844</id><name>Deadliest Warrior: Legends</name><description>Overview Deadliest Warrior: Legends is a 3D weapon-based fighting game developed by                   Pipeworks and published by                  345 Games for the                 Xbox 360 (via                Xbox Live Arcade) on July 6, 2011 for 800 msp ($10). The sequel to               Deadliest Warrior: The Game, it is based on the Spike TV show              Deadliest Warrior (where information on historical or modern weaponry are used to determine which of two warriors is the "deadliest"). This sequel adds new gameplay mechanics (such as limb damage and  ring outs) and a new             Risk-style game mode, while switching the original game's generic fighters (such as       ninjas and      pirates) for warriors based on actual  historical figures (such as    Genghis Khan and        Vlad the Impaler). Â Players who own Deadliest Warrior: The Game have bonus weaponry and armor for all fighters.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6399">Bushido Blade</game><game id="6226">Bushido Blade 2</game><game id="12411">Soulcalibur</game><game id="18554">World Heroes</game><game id="19626">World Heroes 2</game><game id="16064">World Heroes 2 JET</game><game id="10827">World Heroes Perfect</game><game id="22940">Kengo: Master of Bushido</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1833549-box_dwl.png</image></root>
