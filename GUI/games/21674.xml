It was released on the original Game Boy on May 21st, 1991 in Japan.The game features a total of 36 maps, and is the first game in the franchise to feature a proper save system (the first game in the franchise, Famicom Wars, featured a save system whereby if you remove the cartridge the game saves were erased). The game is developed by Intelligent Systems, the company who are also responsible for the recent iterations of the series such as Advance Wars on the Nintendo DS.Because of the limitation of the original Game Boy, the game is in black and white. It is possible that due to this hardware limitation and the lack of knowledge on the system in the early days of the systemâ€™s life, the computer AI takes an extended period of time to think about each move.Game Boy Wars is different to Famicom Wars in that the map is based on a hexagon system rather than the square grid its predecessor is based on.The game features multiplayer support where two players can connect two Game Boy systems together and battle against each other. This feature requires two physical copy of the game to be in each system in order for it to work.UnitsInfantryWeapon: Machine GunRange: 1Mobility: 3Gas: 99Cost: 1000MechWeapon: Ground Rocket, Anti-Air MissileRange: 1, 1Mobility: 2Gas: 70Cost: 2000Tank AWeapon: Tank Cannon, Machine GunRange: 1, 1Mobility: 6Gas: 70Cost: 18000Tank BWeapon: Tank Cannon, Machine GunRange: 1, 1Mobility: 4Gas: 32Cost: 6000CannonWeapon: CannonRange: 3-6Mobility: 1Gas: 1Cost: 20000Artillery AWeapon: CannonRange: 3-5Mobility: 4Gas: 50Cost: 14500Artillery BWeapon: CannonRange: 2-3Mobility: 5Gas: 30Cost: 6200MissileWeapon: Anti-Air MissileRange: 2-5Mobility: 4Gas: 40Cost: 12000Anti-AirWeapon: Anti-Air CannonRange: 1Mobility: 5Gas: 50Cost: 5500Rocket LauncherWeapon: Anti-Air RocketRange: 2-3Mobility: 4Gas: 50Cost: 6200ReconWeapon: Machine GunRange: 1Mobility: 6Gas: 70Cost: 4200RigWeapon: NoneRange: NAMobility: 5Gas: 60Cost: 3500Fighter AWeapon: S Winder, Vulcan GunRange: 1,1Mobility: 9Gas: 80Cost: 26000Fighter BWeapon: S Winder, Vulcan GunRange: 1,1Mobility: 8Gas: 70Cost: 16000BomberWeapon: BombRange: 1Mobility: 7Gas: 90Cost: 22000Battle CopterWeapon: Ground Rocket, Machine GunRange: 1,1Mobility: 5Gas: 70Cost: 7500Transport CopterWeapon: Machine GunRange: 1Mobility: 6Gas: 60Cost: 4000BattleshipWeapon: Anti-Ship Missile, Anti-Air MissileRange: 2-6, 2-6Mobility: 5Gas: 90Cost: 30000CarrierWeapon: Anti-Air MissileRange: 2-6Mobility: 5Gas: 90Cost: 20000Transport ShipWeapon: Machine GunRange: 1Mobility: 5Gas: 90Cost: 16500SubmarineWeapon: TorpedoRange: 1-3Mobility: 4Gas: 90Cost: 24000Tank ZWeapon: Tank Cannon, Machine GunRange: 1-3, 1-3Mobility: 4Gas: 80Cost: 28000Super MissileWeapon: Super MissileRange: 1-3Mobility: 8Gas: 99Cost: 77000Radar TransporterWeapon: NoneRange: NAMobility: 8Gas: 99Cost: 4000ReferencesOfficial website (Japanese)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21244">Super Robot Wars W</game><game id="18606">Daisenryaku G</game><game id="20300">Super Robot Taisen Original Generation</game><game id="2439">Another Bible</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10712/225155-37df9d06ac180f7d64746cff0e9feff4.jpg</image></root>
