The game has had much successes, and the developers decided to have a sequel, which most say was a letdown because it was a "pay for play" game. One of the game's most viewed aspects was its opening to mods, and having a large community based, which allowed the game to live on way after the original. Some even claim a multiplayer mod was in development, but never saw the light of day because the game wasn't "designed" for multiplayer.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1157">Centipede</game><game id="2445">Galaxian</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="15784">Galaga</game><game id="9694">Megamania</game><game id="2773">Millipede</game><game id="14030">Demons to Diamonds</game><game id="15941">Demon Attack</game><game id="16120">Space Armada</game><game id="13036">Gorf</game><game id="14539">Astro Warrior</game><game id="12834">Alien Invaders - Plus!</game><game id="21465">Retro Game Challenge</game><game id="13292">Wavy Navy</game><game id="20713">Computer Space</game><game id="9619">TI Invaders</game><game id="23097">Lunar Rescue</game><game id="23221">Phoenix</game><game id="8975">Pleiads</game><game id="14153">Juno First</game><game id="23504">Vector Vaders</game><game id="1750">Pepsi Invaders</game><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="13424">Cheesy Invaders</game><game id="1293">CHAMP Invaders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/330/555156-chicken3screen1.jpg</image></root>
