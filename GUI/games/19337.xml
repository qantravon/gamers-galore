Those tasks include passing through hoops, step on platforms until they disappear, ride roller coasters, etc. There are 4 worlds with 5 levels in each one, and the levels are large, many of them containing awkwardly positioned spikes that kill instantly.Aero can attack enemies by shooting limited stars or by doing an aerial diagonal drill attack at his target (when he is in the air).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="9716">Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure</game><game id="9742">Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel</game><game id="468">TinHead</game><game id="24993">Prehistorik Man</game><game id="11841">Garfield: Caught in the Act</game><game id="397">James Pond 2: Codename: RoboCod</game><game id="11083">Rocky Rodent</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363122-snes_aerotheacrobat.jpg</image></root>
