<root><id>39454</id><name>Shooting Gallery</name><description>OverviewA game created for Sega's light-gun accessory, the Sega Light Phaser. The goal in each round is to shoot targets as they move across the screen. Each round is slightly different, offering up anything from ducks to hot air balloons to balls moving through pipes. Each stage has a specific goal of targets to shoot before the player can proceed onto the next.Oddly, each stage is depicted as a painted backdrop as missed shots are shown as having broken through the picture to the brick wall behind. How this explains the many moving elements is unclear.</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2758">Duck Hunt</game><game id="20354">Gangster Town</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2297672-sega_master_system_shooting_gallery.jpg</image></root>
