<root><id>24986</id><name>Propeller Arena</name><description>Propeller Arena was a multiplayer aerial combat game that was developed and completed by          Sega AM2 studios. It was  canceled two day's after the 2001Â Sepetember 11th terrorist attacks on the         United States, in        New York City and       Washington D.C. It was cited that the developers felt it replicated images far to similar to the very recent attacks. The general population was very angry in the United States at the time and Sega did not want to risk tarnishing it's name by disrespecting the victims of 9/11. It's also been stated that the game was going to be canned anyway due to the failing Sega      Dreamcast in North America. The game was going to take place in 2045 where tournaments would be held and pilots must use     WWII era planes to fight in these war games. They had modern weapons, but with classic planes. It featured big varied multiplayer maps with 6 characters. It was at one point described as "   Quake in the Skies".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20140">Alien Front Online</game><game id="17960">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</game><game id="9920">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</game><game id="14827">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</game><game id="18377">Heroes of the Pacific</game><game id="20968">Heroes Over Europe</game><game id="13712">Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII</game><game id="12911">Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</game><game id="4075">Wing Arms</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/852196-516693_28388_front.jpg</image></root>
