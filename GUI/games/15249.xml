Antagonists Dr. Cortex of Crash Bandicoot fame, and Ripto of Spyro the Dragon fame, have teamed up to wreck havoc on the world! Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot must team up to save the world! The game is predominately a single player side-scrolling platform, but minigame challenges, such as a Breakout! clone, make up a sizable chunk of the game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="732">Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage</game><game id="3438">MediEvil II</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="7804">Rocket: Robot on Wheels</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="15991">Chameleon Twist 2</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="7659">Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure</game><game id="19795">Crash SuperPack</game><game id="35545">Fuse</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803672-box_spyrootcc.png</image></root>
