<root><id>42525</id><name>Under the Ocean</name><description>Overcome the weather, vicious animals, injuries, disease, dehydration and famine to build your home on a deserted island.
You start out shipwrecked, thirsty and alone. Start your campfire, find weapons and forage for food before the night sets in.
You scavenge what you can from what's washed up on the beach; but from then on, you're on your own.

Hundreds of items interact in strange and unexpected ways.
Attach glow worms to spears to light your way. Attach explosives to make them deadly. Attach a rifle because - well, why not?
Craft your own shelter, bridges and walls. Build traps to snare animals.

Travel through beaches, caves and jungles. Swim through lakes and raft over oceans.
Search for exotic crafting materials in hidden and deadly locations.
Find your way home.</description><genres><genre>Adventure</genre><genre>Life Simulation</genre><genre>Platform</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17699-1.png</image></root>
