As better technology was established, Space Ace II was released including the cut scenes as well as a handful of establishing animations to bring Borf back into the mix. This tactic of releasing new content mixed with older animations was employed by Don Bluth on multiple occasions with games like  Dragon's Lair 3. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23">Dragon's Lair</game><game id="5696">Award Winners</game><game id="13227">Road Avenger</game><game id="13800">Guy Spy and the Crystals of Armageddon</game><game id="17483">Out of This World</game><game id="30888">Cobra Command</game><game id="41330">Triad Stone</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/107341/1505085-borfsrvng.png</image></root>
