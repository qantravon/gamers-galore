The player controls a man named Orin with a falcon sidekick named Cutrus that can be controlled by a second player. The bird is also controllable in the single-player, however some may find the control scheme difficult. The goal of the game is to infiltrate the castles of the eight dukes and retrieve the stolen 8 Eyes, gems of unimaginable power that were formed in the explosions of the nuclear missiles that begat the apocalypse.This game is considered similar to Castlevania as it shares a very similar design with its visuals and level design, as well as having various sub-weapons which are powered by an item usually dropped by enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6673">Castlevania</game><game id="17939">Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3509/693655-8eyes_nes_na.jpg</image></root>
