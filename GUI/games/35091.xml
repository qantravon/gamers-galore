However, despite all locations and names of countries being fictional, real world aircraft is used.GameplayAssault Horizon Legacy is a flight combat title where players are pitted against ground targets and enemy planes. The gameplay is not on-rails meaning the player is able to fly toward any direction at all times over expansive environments.Like Ace Combat: Assault Horizon for PS3 and Xbox 360, Assault Horizon Legacy receives gameplay additions, namely in the form of single-button combat maneuvers, which no Ace Combat title previously had. However, the implementation of these additions are different in Assault Horizon Legacy when compared to Ace Combat: Assault Horizon for PS3 and Xbox 360. When close enough to an enemy aircraft, in Assault Horizon Legacy, the player can press a button which causes their aircraft to immediately swoop behind the enemy on its own, after which the player's aircraft is temporarily locked behind the enemy, during which time it is easier to get a hit on the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft, if not shot down, breaks away after only a few seconds, returning the gameplay to normal.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31757">Star Fox 64 3D</game><game id="31748">Pilotwings Resort</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2213146-box_acahl.png</image></root>
