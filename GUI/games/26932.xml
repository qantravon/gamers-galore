<root><id>26932</id><name>Glory of Heracles</name><description>OverviewGlory of Heracles is the fifth game in its series, which started back on the original Famicom. While the earlier titles in the series were produced and published by the now-defunct Data East, Nintendo sought to publish a new game in the series for the DS and teamed up with the property holder Paon, a company comprised of former Data East staff. The game's scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima, who had previously worked on entries in the Final Fantasy series, most notably Final Fantasy VII, in addition to his work as the scenario writer for the third and fourth Heracles titles. Combat in the game is a turn-based affair, with special attacks that can be powered up by completing a mini-game on the touch-screen. The game was released in North America on January 18, 2010.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24200">Sands of Destruction</game><game id="22703">Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen</game><game id="7197">Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</game><game id="23936">7th Dragon</game><game id="21666">Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies</game><game id="21240">Black Sigil: Blade of the Exiled</game><game id="9249">Chrono Trigger</game><game id="25435">Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans</game><game id="26833">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</game><game id="21463">Final Fantasy III</game><game id="20829">Final Fantasy IV</game><game id="23987">Nostalgia</game><game id="23478">Suikoden Tierkreis</game><game id="24394">The Wizard of Oz: Beyond The Yellow Brick Road</game><game id="27186">Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</game><game id="5827">Final Fantasy Legend II</game><game id="25150">Summon Night X: Tears Crown</game><game id="267">Golden Sun</game><game id="4277">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</game><game id="30297">Metal Max 3</game><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/27239/1240188-glory_of_heracles_boxart.jpg</image></root>
