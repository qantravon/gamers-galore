Players will get to take control of a ninja called Nin-Ja and face a variety of environmental hazards and enemies over the course of 50 levels in two modes: Adventure and Score Attack. The game was released on Xbox Live Arcade on April 27, 2011 for 400 Microsoft Points, and until the end of June all proceeds from the game's sales will be donated to the Japanese Red Cross.GameplayThe player takes control of Nin-Ja, who is forced to collect legendary scrolls said to make the individual that collected them a 'super awesome ninja' by Namakura, the president of Aomekakushi party. Namakura kidnaps Princess Sakura and demands the scrolls in return for her safety. In each level Nin-Ja must collect every scroll to open a gateway to the next stage. Nin-Ja has the ability to use his Kusari to grapple on walls or hooks and then perform a dash. He also has a power up that once activated will kill enemies when they're touched.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20773">N+</game><game id="34222">Instant Brain</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1771220-box_nin2jump.png</image></root>
