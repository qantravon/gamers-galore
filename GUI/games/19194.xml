The game has you, as Donald, trying to return a cursed treasure to save your Uncle Scrooge. The game was fairly nonlinear as you could play the worlds in any order you wanted, and, unlike in Quackshot, their was no correct order to play through the levels.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9412">QuackShot starring Donald Duck</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48222/1377788-13730.jpg</image></root>
