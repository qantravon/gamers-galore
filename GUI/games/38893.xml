The player stays relatively stationary in the center of the screen, and is surrounded by attacking enemies that come at the player in time with the beat of the song. As with most rhythm games, multipliers are gained and scores are increased the longer you go without making a mistake.The game features a tracklist of 18 songs.Tracklist(partial)Pendulum – Self vs. SelfMarilyn Manson – The Beautiful PeopleRob Zombie – Scum of the EarthVoicians – The ConstructShen Yi – War DanceCelldweller – I Can't WaitStyles of Beyond – Nine ThouSouthpaw Swagger – It's ShowtimeBlue Stahli – UltranumbPapa Roach - Last Resort</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21831">Beats</game><game id="41844">Way of the Dogg</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg</image></root>
