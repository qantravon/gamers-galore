The fighting, known in the game as Mayhem mode, took place in a 3D arena in a similar fashion to something like Power Stone, allowing for full free movement of the character. Pick-ups, traps, hazards, teleporters, bounce pads, and more filled each arena, with some characters being better suited to different stages.The strategy mode of the game took place on a hexagonal grid and was a simple turn-based affair where players could buy, move, and attack units, with the eventual aim being to destroy the enemy's base before losing your own.StoryThe game takes place on the planet Xsarra, upon which dwell the native, and mostly monstrous inhabitants, the Arcanes. Another race, known as the Teknos, consisting predominantly of cyborg warriors, crash-landed on the planet, and upon discovering its rich resources, instigated a war with the Arcanes for control of Xsarra. The war lasted over two decades, before a truce was formed between the two races, calling for peace and civility, and allowing both races to live together harmoniously, with only one rule: no Arcane may have a child with a Teknos, and vice versa. After a few years of peace, an Arcane male falls in love with a Teknos female. The couple do not procreate, but their relationship is cause enough for war to re-emerge on the planet.The game begins at this point, with the player choosing their side and attempting to win the war.The story is only really relevant in the Strategy mode, with the Mayhem mode having no cut-scenes or exposition of any kind, and allowing for the races to fight amongst themselves.CharactersArcanesBrontu - A large, slow-moving Rhino-like creature, with the ability to unleash a shockwave, a charge attack, and a toxic gas cloud.Prana Devil - The blue, reptilian creature seen on the game's cover.
