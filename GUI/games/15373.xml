To progress through the levels, you must grow, and the only way to do that is by consuming other fish. However, you can only eat fish which are smaller than you - fish larger than you can eat you! In addition to larger fish, you also have to dodge nets and fishing hooks.  Each level is broken into three stage: the first stage you must eat smaller, white fish in order to progress, while dodging hazards. In the second stage, you must navigate around a tight maze eating enough smaller white fish to complete the stage. And on the final stage, you must free your fish friends trapped inside a fishing net - however the only way to do this is to eat smaller fish in order to become stronger so you are able to bite through the net and free them. The catch is that as you eat fish, you get bigger in size. The bigger you get in size, the more difficult it becomes to navigate around the hazards presented to you. If you touch a hazard such as the side of a net or hook, then you lose a life, of which you only have so many.  In addition to hazards, you also have to battle against the clock - you only have a certain amount of time to complete each stage before it's Game Over.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56729/1394537-freddy_fish_000.png</image></root>
