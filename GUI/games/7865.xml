There were six stages ranging from caves and gothic church-like structures to completely  mechanical and twisted tunnels seemingly inside the body of some creature. The game relies heavily on browns and greys in its colour  palette to create its mood.The character you control is an angel called wor with feathered wings, his weapons are mostly unimpressive but  functional. The three types of shot you are able to use include a concentrated fire, a triangular fire and a dual shot where you would be able to fire both in front and behind.You would be required to fight a mid-level boss and an end of level boss  at the end of all the very tough levels, There were no save points and you would only be allowed to continue from the point you died if lives were remaining. The game despite only having 6 levels is like many japanese shmups and is incredibly tough.there were four difficulty levels, those includedEasy, Medium, Hard and Hyper</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="6797">Cho Aniki</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/711388-wowomg0f.jpg</image></root>
