What she finds however is a widespread conspiracy and poisoned food supplies. One of the last games  Cryo Interactive Entertainment developed. Following in the vain of their previous educational adventure games. The player gets to explore a historic city, use items, talk to Egyptians, perform a trading minigame, dance to some drums and solve a crime. The database of historical information about the culture, art, people and places of the time makes a return. As does the option to skip the story altogether and just explore Heliopolis as it was in 1360 BC.  This was the last game where Cryo collaborated with  French institution   Réunion des musées nationaux. The graphics saw a great improvement over Cryo's previous adventure games. With the pre-rendered panorama's now containing more detail and animations than before. But the main difference to most of Cryo's previous adventure games is the focus on it's story. Like  Atlantis: The Lost Tales before it and  Beyond  Atlantis 2 after, this game focuses more on it's characters and their predicament rather than the setting and edutainment part of it.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14850">The Cameron Files: Pharaoh's Curse</game><game id="8448">The Egyptian Prophecy</game><game id="2111">The Mystery of the Mummy</game><game id="2640">Versailles 1685</game><game id="10419">Egypt 1156 B.C.: Tomb of the Pharaoh</game><game id="12517">China: The Forbidden City</game><game id="20362">Atlantis: The Lost Tales</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/128514/1769745-egypt2_cover.jpg</image></root>
