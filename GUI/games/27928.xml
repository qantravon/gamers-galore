The game's protagonist, MarkerMan, is on a mission to reunite himself with his missing dog, DoodleDog. The player can draw 4 basic shapes to help MarkerMan make his way through each of the games 150 levels. The shapes include a line, square, circle and triangle and each will deplete MarkerMan's supply of ink a small amount. Markerman can also trap enemies in a small circle which does not deplete ink.  The game had a limited release on August 25th, 2009 after an approximate 6-9 month development cycle. It was mainly available for purchase online through Amazon and WalMart, though shorty after it's release it could be found in certain Best Buy stores. At this time there was a single production run, plans for future production runs are not known. </description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1114897-markerman.jpg</image></root>
