The end result however is nowhere as near as good as a game as the original.    The game does have the exact same level layout, character names and goals as the original except for a few minor differences like In this version Mario is a carpenter. The game play however is quite broken in places with inaccurate hit detection where barrels could kill you after you jump over them, ladders that you can climb that are not actually drawn on the screen, elevators on the second level you could ride off of the top of the screen to beat the level and a bonus score that if you let reach 0 actually awarded you over 60000 points.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="311">Donkey Kong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1356640-kong_2.gif</image></root>
