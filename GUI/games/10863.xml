<root><id>10863</id><name>Prince of Persia 3D</name><description>PlotThe game's plot revolves around the betrayal of the Sultan of Persia by his brother Assad and the resulting kidnap of the Princess of Persia. The Prince must chase down the evil half-tiger half-man Prince Rugnor who wishes to wed the Princess. The chase takes the Prince through various levels filled with traps and architecturally baffling chasms. During the course of the Prince's journey the main plot is told by cutscenes. In these the player discovers that unsurprisingly the Princess is unwilling to submit to Rugnor. Once the Prince finally chases down Rugnor a climatic final battle ensues in which the Princess is tied to a massive gear heading towards a squishy demise. The Prince must kill Rugnor (by no means a easy feat) before the Princess meets her fate.GameplayThe game takes place on 17 separate levels which involve some 3D platforming and combat. Littered throughout each level are numerous traps that more often than not result in instant death. Therefore due to the poor camera and controls saving often is recommended.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1496">Shade: Wrath of Angels</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3419/617263-1055.jpg</image></root>
