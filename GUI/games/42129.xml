The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.</description><genres><genre>Platform</genre><genre>Puzzle</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10703-1.jpg</image></root>
