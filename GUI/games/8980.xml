Heavy punches are more powerful than light punches, but also take longer to deliver. Stamina meters are also present, if a character completely runs out of stamina then they will become exhausted and unable to fight back for a short period of time. Each punch that connects will send a fighter backwards. Being knocked off the edge of the sidewalk will send a competitor tumbling to the next sidewalk and closer to the manhole that spells the end of the battle.Local residents will occasionally lean out of the buildings the characters are fighting in front of to pelt them with flower pots. A pot that strikes a player will leave them temporarily dazed and also cost them some stamina. The local Police occasionally cruise by, causing the fighters to retreat to opposite ends of the sidewalk to avoid suspicion. If time runs out, the player closest to the edge of the pavement will be arrested and give an automatic victory to his opponent.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362343-nes_urbanchampion_ca.jpg</image></root>
