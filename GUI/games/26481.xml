It is not the same game as the NES version, but does feature similar gameplay. The basic storyline involves 1980's Capcom mascot Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson invading an enemy country to assassinate their leader and stop another war before it can start.GameplayThe Bionic Commando series features the unique gameplay element of the bionic grapple arm which hoists the player to higher platforms and allows them to swing across gaps. Platforming is centered on this core concept so much so that this is one of the few games in this genre that does not allow the player to jump. Every move you make must involve thought on how to travel via the grapple.Super Joe also comes equipped with a gun that can be upgraded with pick-ups dropped from parachutes.ReleasesThe arcade version has been re-released as part of the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1.There is also a PC port of the arcade version that adds an additional level.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15457">Rush'n Attack</game><game id="21323">RoboCop</game><game id="18596">Power Blade II</game><game id="18686">Power Blade</game><game id="33418">M.I.A.: Missing In Action</game><game id="12177">Code Name: Viper</game><game id="3353">Rolling Thunder</game><game id="632">Rolling Thunder 2</game><game id="26706">Shadow Complex</game><game id="2018">Metal Slug 4</game><game id="7378">Metal Slug 5</game><game id="18525">Metal Slug 6</game><game id="20743">Metal Slug 7</game><game id="8583">Metal Slug Advance</game><game id="5313">Metal Slug: 1st Mission</game><game id="7743">Metal Slug: 2nd Mission</game><game id="28918">Metal Slug XX</game><game id="18628">Shatterhand</game><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="4237">Contra 4</game><game id="692">Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX</game><game id="13902">Contra: Hard Corps</game><game id="3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</game><game id="11684">Contra: Shattered Soldier</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/1028338-10001701.jpg</image></root>
