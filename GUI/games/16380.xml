<root><id>16380</id><name>Phelios</name><description> Phelios is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up that has you flying on the back of a Pegasus. Gameplay wise, it is very similar to other shoot-em-ups of the time. There's different power ups to collect which make your weapon more powerful or more useful (horizontal shot). There's also power ups to increase your speed, which becomes essential for dodging later in the game. Phelios is fairly unforgiving, you get a health meter, but you can only take a couple hits before it's all over. While never catching on as much as R-type or the like, Phelios stands on its own as a more than competent shoot-em-up which a unique Greek mythology twist.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25613">1944: The Loop Master</game><game id="29829">Dangerous Seed</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371342-genesis_phelios.jpg</image></root>
