These extra customisations included the ability to write mission briefings as complex as those found in the campaign missions, set weapons loadout on AI aircraft and even allow the player to fly helicopters.In the late 90s the game enjoyed a fairly active modding community, in both creation of missions as well as user-created 'expansion packs' that added more aircraft and ground units.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7103">F29 Retaliator</game><game id="9807">Birds of Prey</game><game id="12351">Lock On: Modern Air Combat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2273052-967728734_00.jpg</image></root>
