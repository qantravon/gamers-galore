Your best time is saved on your E-reader, even after you turn off the game.ControlsA: Jump/Pull RopeD-Pad: Move PichuHow to AccessScan in the following cards on your GBA E-Reader from the Pokemon Expedition-e Set:#58 - Pichu (R)#112 - Hoppip (C)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/668799-1195968957_00.png</image></root>
