During the day, players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population. At night, the hunter becomes the hunted, as the infected become aggressive and more dangerous. Most frightening are the predators which only appear after sundown. Players must use everything in their power to survive until the morningâ€™s first light.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Adventure</genre><genre>Horror</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17663-1.jpg</image></root>
