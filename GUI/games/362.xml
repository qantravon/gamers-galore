It also has a touch of Zelda, as each level is split up with a maze-like castle full of monsters and bosses and a precious item that allows Hao to progress further in the game.This would be one of only two games developed by Carry Soft for the Famicom/NES, as they normally produced games for Japanese home computers. The company went under a year later.The US release, "Mystery Quest", was unchanged aside from a few sound effects and the removal of the latter third of the game. Instead of six worlds (including six castles), there are only four.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/221775-mystery_quest.jpg</image></root>
