<root><id>36472</id><name>The California Raisins: The Grape Escape</name><description>Much like Mega Man and DuckTales, this game was a single player side-scrolling action/platformer with 4 levels (The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze, and The Juicery) that could be played in any order before unlocking the final level (The Clouds) by collecting all "musical notes" within the game.The game appears to have been finished but was never released, perhaps due to the quality of the game or the waning popularity of the California Raisins themselves.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30993">Mega Man</game><game id="15799">DuckTales</game><game id="37915">Drac's Night Out</game><game id="35402">Bio Force Ape</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/138495/1897790-california_raisins___the_grape_escape__u_.png</image></root>
