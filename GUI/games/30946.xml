The themes are      jungle,     river,    desert and   volcanic. Similar to the classic  Archon Series, players take turns in moving their dinosaurs across the board. As soon as two dinosaurs clash by occupying the same space on the board, the game switches to a 2D beat-em up sequence in which each player takes control of his dinosaur respectively.  The dinosaurs have different abilities and combat skills and it is crucial to the winning knowing which specific dinosaur gives the player an advantage over his enemies' creatures.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24959">Archon Classic</game><game id="3036">Archon: The Light and the Dark</game><game id="3936">Archon II: Adept</game><game id="662">Archon Ultra</game><game id="876">Dark Legions</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1343300-458px_dinowars.jpg</image></root>
