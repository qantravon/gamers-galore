It is heavily based on Anmitsu Hime, a tie-in game for an unrelated Japanese TV show.PlotA new arcade - the titular High Tech World - has just opened near Alex Kidd's castle home. He wants to go play some Sega games, but the only map has been torn to pieces! He will need to hurry if he is to make it before closing time!GameplayThe game's levels alternate between two distinct styles of play:AdventureThe castle and town (levels 1 and 3) are large, free-roaming areas with emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving. Some events occur according to the in-game clock which normally runs in real-time, but jumps ahead by 5 minutes every time Alex opens a door. If the clock reaches 5pm, the arcade closes and the game is over.PlatformingThe more civilized areas of the world are connected by dangerous backwoods paths (levels 2 and 4) which Alex must traverse while under constant attack by ninjas. These sections are more traditional and straightforward in design - Alex can jump and shoot projectiles, and the goal is simply to make it from one side of the screen to the other. Any money collected in level 2 can be spent on items in the following adventure area. The clock continues to run down in real-time.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5220">Wonder Boy</game><game id="9245">Wonder Boy in Monster World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2417184-box_akhtw.png</image></root>
