<root><id>39224</id><name>The Irritating Maze</name><description>OverviewThe Irritating Maze is one of the few games on the Neo Geo hardware that wasn't released in the home-based AES format. Dedicated cabinets have bright, flashing lights that surround the screen and an air blower. When you fail and "get shocked" in the game, the lights flash and a burst of air is shot up into your face to simulate the effect. It is the only Neo Geo game to require a trackball, which in turn requires a separate BIOS setup that prevents "normal" Neo Geo games from working properly.The game is also compatible with a card printer that prints the player's path through the final course--assuming the player completes the final course, that is.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33849">Uchhannanchan no Honou no Challenge: Denryuu IraIra Bou</game><game id="17253">Irritating Stick</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2285204-irairabou.jpg</image></root>
