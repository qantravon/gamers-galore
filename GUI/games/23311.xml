<root><id>23311</id><name>Defense Grid: The Awakening</name><description>OverviewDefense Grid: The Awakening is a  3D  tower defense game released on December 9th, 2008 on the  Steam platform. Additionally, a version was later released for  Xbox Live Arcade on September 2, 2009. The PC version contains 20 different maps. Each map can have multiple variations on the conditions, such as making the enemies harder or reducing the amount of resources the player has access to. There is a light story narrated by the player's AI companion, which involves the destruction of human civilization by a race of interdimensional aliens, the enemies in the game.GameplayDefense Grid is based on placing turrets of different sorts in special squares on each map to prevent the alien enemy from stealing the player's power cores. Each turret has its own amount of damage and range to attack the enemies. The enemies enter through one or two different locations and take the shortest route to the player's power generator. If the aliens make it to the generator, they steal power cores from the AI companion. The aliens will then attempt to escape with the cores by making it to an exit location. Additionally, there are airborne enemies with their own path through each level independent of the towers or level geometry. Unlike other tower defense games, you are allowed to completely block the enemy's path with towers, but doing so forces the aliens to path between the towers. This allows the player to either make paths with no towers that the enemies must go down or just cover every square to try to do even more damage.SteamAs a Steam-powered game, Defense Grid has Steam achievements, leaderboards, and integration with other steam services. The game was on sale on steam from February 16th to March 2nd, 2009 for 25% off ($14.99), and in May 2009 as part of a weekend deal that put the game 75% off (5$). On March 3, 2010, the downloadable package originally only available to the Xbox Live Arcade entitled Borderlands which contains four new maps was released for free to Steam users.DLCResurgence: A new 8 map DLC pack entitled Resurgence was released by Hidden Path Entertainment in April 2010. On Steam, the Resurgence pack actually consists of 4 downloadable map packs for $1 per pack. Each pack contains 2 maps.You Monster: The You Monster DLC pack is more like a full expansion pack, complete with a full campaign, storyline, and guest star  GLaDOS. This DLC also provides 8 new maps to play, complete with devious twists on the classic gameplay, and was released December 7, 2011.Containment: An 8 level DLC pack the was funded by  Kickstarter.

Since it is the first tower you have access to, many assume it to be less useful as more towers become available. This couldn't be more untrue and, in reality, most of the more difficult maps can be beat while earning a gold medal by using this tower exclusively. The main reason behind this is that it's cost-damage ratio is actually much higher than most other towers; a level 3 Gun tower is cheaper than many level 2 towers. In addition, it is the best tower versus shields.PC System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating System: Windows XP, VistaProcessor: 1.8GHz CPU or higherRAM Memory: 512 MBHard Disk Space: 1GB available spaceDirectX: DirectX 9.0cVideo Card: DirectX 9 video card with shader 2 supportSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatibleOperating System: Windows XP, VistaProcessor: dual core 2.0GHz CPU or higherRAM Memory: 1GB RAM XP, 1.5GB RAM VistaHard Disk Space: 1GB available spaceDirectX: DirectX 9.0c or higherVideo Card: DirectX 9.0c video card with shader 3 support and 256MB VRAMSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12764">PixelJunk Monsters</game><game id="22139">Desktop Tower Defense</game><game id="20502">Defend Your Castle</game><game id="22801">Ninjatown</game><game id="20946">Defendin' de Penguin</game><game id="23319">Savage Moon</game><game id="25709">Plants vs. Zombies</game><game id="26325">Tower Revolution</game><game id="23102">South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!</game><game id="29428">PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe</game><game id="16164">Immortal Defense</game><game id="30400">Sol Survivor</game><game id="31207">Murky Horizon</game><game id="32495">Robo Defense</game><game id="35676">Two Worlds II Castle Defense</game><game id="34265">Orcs Must Die!</game><game id="39655">Shadâ€™O</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1357284-dgrid_box.png</image></root>
