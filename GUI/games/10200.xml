Critically acclaimed it is notable as possibly the first example of co-op on a home video game.The Druid could attack enemies with water, fire or electricity, turn invisible and summon a golem to help him. All of these were in finite supply so had to be used carefully and the three attacks were more effective on some types of enemies than others.The Golem could be controlled by a second player or assigned basic stop, go follow commands.The game was originally created by Firebird Software and released on many home computers such as the Atari 8-Bit, the ZX Spectrum and the C64/128 in 1986. Two years later it was published on the Japanese MSX2 home computer by Nippon Dexter and on the Famicom Disk System by Jaleco.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15396">Druid II: Enlightenment</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1347763-druid_casette.jpg</image></root>
