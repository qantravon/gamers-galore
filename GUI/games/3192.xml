The player controls ALF around the neighborhood, searching for pieces of his spacecraft in this top-down action game.GameplayALF is controlled using the keyboard or joystick, in any of four directions around a maze-shaped neighborhood, over several stages. The player may carry one single item at a time, and must bring cats and spacecraft pieces back to the garage. In order to carry a cat, ALF must first eat a pizza, which are scattered around the map. Eating a pizza gives ALF a limited time window in which he must grab a cat, and get it back to the garage. After catching all cats, ALF must find a spacecraft piece and bring it to the garage.Willie Tanner roams the map, seeking ALF. If ALF is caught by Willie, all items currently in the garage are lost. Additionally, a dog catcher roams the neighborhood. If ALF is caught by the dog catcher, Willie will rescue him, but only three times, after which, the game is over.There is a time limit to completing the game's stages - if time lapses, the game is over. If the player collects all spacecraft parts on all stages before the time limit lapses, the player wins, and becomes a member of the "Honorary Melmac Skleen Club".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/666214-alf_tfa.gif</image></root>
