Taking them all to the wizard                          Dazz Bazian would enable him to create the spell that would take you to the next level.Certain items could also be bought from Dazz Bazian to help the player through the level. These included extra time and lives, scrolls (so that you could 'skip' searching for one), and perhaps most importantly, a powered up weapon, which made tackling adversaries significantly easier. Coins to purchase these items could be found throughout the levels. There were also coin rooms, where, if the coins were collected in the correct order, larger amounts to spend could be amassed.Whilst the game was not long, it was addictive in its simple gameplay and could at times prove to be very difficult (sometimes due to lousy controls).   </description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6754">Treasure Island Dizzy</game><game id="19468">Widget</game><game id="26479">Clover</game><game id="18367">Mayhem in Monsterland</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/898380-flimbo_s_quest___front.jpg</image></root>
