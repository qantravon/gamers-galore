<root><id>13087</id><name>X-Men: Legends</name><description>OverviewX-Men Legends is an isometric action RPG released in 2004, in the tradition of games such as  Diablo and  Gauntlet. In the game players pick a team of four  X-men out of the 15 playable characters available, and then take to the field to start hacking, slashing, and solving various puzzles. One of the unique selling points of the game is that there are several ways in which to solve each puzzle depending on which heroes are in your party of four.  Each X-man has their own unique powers and abilities,  which enable several different solutions to a single puzzle.  For example, suppose there is a chasm you need to get across.  One solution could be to have Ice Man build a frozen bridge for the team to cross.  Another solution would be to have Rogue fly across the gap while carrying a teammate.  Although you can play as any of the 15 characters you wish during the missions, in between missions the story takes place from the perspective of Alison Crestemere (Magma).  Alison is a mutant that can manipulate lava whose powers have only recently manifested.  Alison relies on the X-Men to teach her how to control her new powers, and use them in the fight against evil. Playable Heroes Wolverine - James Howlett Cyclops - Scott Summers Magma - Alison Crestmere Iceman - Bobby Drake Rogue - Anna MarieStorm - Ororo MunroeBeast - Hank McCoy Jean Grey Jubilee - Jubilation Lee NightCrawler - Kurt Wagner Gambit - Remy LeBeau Colossus - Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin Professor X - Charles Xavier Emma Frost Psylocke - Elizabeth Braddock  Non-Playable Villians and EnemiesAcolytesAvalanche - Dominikos Loannis Petrakis Blob -  Frederick J.
