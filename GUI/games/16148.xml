The plot of the game is Earth has been invaded by aliens, and you are a pilot on a mission to bring back an object to Earth that can save it. The game is played completely from a first person perspective using the Zapper to control the game. The game play is similar to other light gun shooters on the NES, but To The Earth is known for being particularly difficult. Every time that the player misses an enemy, gets hit or shot by an enemy, or shoots a friendly ship, their ship's health goes down. Various powerups are available to the player to use, but the game is still extremely difficult despite this.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19777">Laser Invasion</game><game id="2758">Duck Hunt</game><game id="6490">Hogan's Alley</game><game id="4116">Wild Gunman</game><game id="1113">Gumshoe</game><game id="29088">Shooting Range</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362316-nes_totheearth_fr.jpg</image></root>
