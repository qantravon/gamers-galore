The game rendered a solid (untextured) 3D landscape, but was only able to do at a very low frame rate, so the gameplay was mostly puzzle in nature. It was still an impressive experience for players used to wireframe or sprite based games.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="9612">Castle Master</game><game id="23647">Total Eclipse</game><game id="6686">Dark Side</game><game id="34979">Total Eclipse II : The Sphinx Jinx</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/70/492687-driller.jpg</image></root>
