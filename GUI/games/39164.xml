You start with a rifle, a barrack and a generator and you have to defend it every night as zombies try to destroy you and the generator. During daytime you need to go out into the wild and find supplies like bullets, rifle parts and armor. During these trips you frequently have to kill zombies you encounter. The game follows a day-night cycle so every night you need to be 'home' again to defend your generator.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/128518/2280308-deadly30_packshot.jpg</image></root>
