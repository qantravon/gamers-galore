<root><id>21707</id><name>Fury</name><description>OverviewFury was launched on October 16, 2007, developed by Auran and published by Gamecock Media Group. This is was the first game published by Gamecock. The game's main focus was fast, frantic PvP game as an alternative to the perceived slow, repetitive PvE grind of other MMOs. However, this strategy backfired, as Fury was panned by critics for being too chaotic. Fury failed to hook a sustainable audience, and so the servers were shut down on August 7th, 2008. The shut down came not even ten months after the launch.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12376">The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar</game><game id="18603">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</game><game id="11142">Final Fantasy XI Online</game><game id="16614">Ragnarok Online</game><game id="4791">Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</game><game id="12149">Dark Age of Camelot</game><game id="3875">Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs</game><game id="15284">Dark Age of Camelot: Darkness Rising</game><game id="4245">Dark Age of Camelot: Trials of Atlantis</game><game id="15285">Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles</game><game id="18547">EverQuest II</game><game id="14901">EverQuest II: Echoes of Faydwer</game><game id="4201">EverQuest II: Kingdom of Sky</game><game id="13250">EverQuest II: Rise of Kunark</game><game id="19166">EverQuest II: Desert of Flames</game><game id="1475">Shadowbane:  The Rise of Chaos</game><game id="10099">Shadowbane</game><game id="20666">Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning</game><game id="9641">Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</game><game id="23583">ROSE Online</game><game id="19796">City of Heroes</game><game id="7316">City of Villains</game><game id="9437">Star Wars: Galaxies - An Empire Divided</game><game id="9681">Star Wars: Galaxies - Jump to Light Speed</game><game id="13057">Star Wars: Galaxies - Trials of Obi-Wan</game><game id="5621">Star Wars: Galaxies - Starter Kit</game><game id="7318">Star Wars: Galaxies - Episode III Rage of the Wookiees</game><game id="32725">Shadowbane: Throne of Oblivion</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2199/230629-furygamelogo.jpg</image></root>
