It was released roughly half a year after the first two Zelda CD-i games, Link: The faces of Evil, and Zelda: The Wand of Gamalon, were released Unlike the two aforementioned games however Zelda's Adventure was markedly different in several ways. Like Wand of Gamalon you play as Zelda however unlike the previous two CDI games this game uses digitalized graphics (similar to Martal Kombat)  and live action cut scenes as opposed to the animated oness of the previous titles. Also the game is viewed from a top-down view as opposed to a side scroller.   The game is notable for it's frequent load times, which take place between each screen transition, given that each screen could be traversed in a matter of seconds this could be a frequent source of frustration for the player.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5043">Link: The Faces of Evil</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9560/249745-zelda_adventure_box.jpg</image></root>
