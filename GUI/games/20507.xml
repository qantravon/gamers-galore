<root><id>20507</id><name>Dungeon Runners</name><description>Introduction Dungeon Runners was a free-to-play MMORPG published by NCSoft and developed by NCSoft West.  It was designed as a parody of traditional fantasy MMORPGs and dungeon crawlers such as EverQuest and Diablo II.   Going live on May 24, 2007, the game was closed on December 31st, 2009.  Business Model The game was supported by optional subscriptions, in-game advertising (largely, if not entirely, for other NCSoft properties), as well as retail box sales.  Subscribers had access to higher login queue priority, larger storage, stackable consumable items, and exclusive access to the highest tier of item, which in a parody of the traditional MMO rarity color scheme, were 'rainbow' colored.  The retail box sold for $19.99 USD, and included six months of game time, as well as a Bling Gnome pet which automatically gathered gold for you, as well as eating lower-rarity items and 'processing' them into gold.  ClassesWhen creating a new character, players were given the choice of three classes, Fighter, Mage, and Ranger.  However, this only affected beginning stats and items, and it was possible to learn skills for any class from the appropriate trainer.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15259/553513-dungeonrunner_front.jpg</image></root>
