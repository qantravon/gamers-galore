The player takes control of an arsenal of U.S. Naval  submarines. These submarines face enemy warships across the key naval warzones of World War II. The game begins in 1943 as the German Army, during WW2, starts to use U-Boats in order to attack. As the captain of a U.S. submarine fleet, the player will be facing enemy assaults both above and below the surface of the water throughout the 30 missions in the game.The game has been described by     505 Games as "arcade style," meaning that it differs greatly from other submarine titles such as    Silent Hunter. Instead, the game allows players to adopt different roles throughout the missions. The firing of the deck gun is more akin to a title like   Battlefield 1943 than to a submarine sim.The game removes many of the complexities of previous submarine games in order to create a more console-friendly environment. There are only three levels of depth that the player can utilize and there are only ever two weapons available for use at any one time.   The multiplayer component of the game involves a 4-player mode that is similar to "capture the fort." This "territory" mode involves players moving to locations marked by a flag and trying to control them for as long as possible.  The game was released on June 15th, 2010 exclusively on Xbox 360 by 505 Games.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28094">Silent Hunter V: Battle of the Atlantic</game><game id="25262">Battlefield 1943</game><game id="20481">Battlestations: Pacific</game><game id="10768">Battlestations: Midway</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1825102-box_natkt.png</image></root>
