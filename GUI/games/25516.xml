<root><id>25516</id><name>Puzzle Kingdoms</name><description>Puzzle Kingdom attempts to spice up their familiar puzzle game with a few new, unique features. Hero vs. Puzzle gives way to Military vs. Puzzle. You can now have an entire military at your command, ranging from a lowly Soldier, up to Knights, as well as Archers. Each with their own assets and abilities.In addition, your hero is no longer something you have to live with for the entire game. Not only can you swap out your hero for a different one at any time, you also can have more then one of them lined up and ready to go. This adds a whole new strategic depth to the game. Allowing you to have a specific hero built for a specific puzzle.The puzzle system also receives some revamping. You no longer are forced to match three gems every turn. You can simple move some of the gem around, maneuvering things, and planning ahead for a more devastating match up.Minimum Requirements:Operating system: Windows XP/VistaProcessor: Pentium 4, 1.5GHz or better CPUMemory: 256 MB RAMHard disk space: 500 MB of hard disk spaceVideo: NVidia 5 series or better, ATI 8 series or betterSound: DirectSound compatible sound cardDirectXÂ®: DirectX 9.0c (Nov 2007 edition) </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20567">Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</game><game id="24934">Puzzle Quest Chapter 1: Battle of Gruulkar</game><game id="23282">Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure</game><game id="11865">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</game><game id="22322">Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box</game><game id="24493">Bejeweled Twist</game><game id="35410">Runespell: Overture</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6182/916637-puzzlekingdomswii.jpg</image></root>
