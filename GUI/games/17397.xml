There are 32 distinct levels in the arcade version and 72 in the        NES and       Famicom Disk System ports. The player must kill all enemies on the island in order to advance to the next level. To do this,      Taizo still has his air pump from the original, which is used to pump up enemies till they explode. In addition to the pump Taizo also has a new weapon, a drill. The drill is used on holes in the ground to cause part of the island to crumble and fall in the water, this causes enemies that are on the part of the island that crumbled to fall into the water killing them.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33982">Do!
