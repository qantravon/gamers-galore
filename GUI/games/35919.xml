However, it only uses three as opposed to DDR's myriad, and features infrared hand sensors in front. These hand sensors can detect a new variety of dance moves involving the hands instead of the boards in other games which use only the feet.The game has been very popular in Korea and England with limited success in America. The series was set to continue with a title called EZ2DJ, but the developer has gone bankrupt recently due to a patent infringement suit by Konami.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="29418">Dance Dance Revolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/65153/2302778-ez2dancer.png</image></root>
