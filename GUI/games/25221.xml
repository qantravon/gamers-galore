<root><id>25221</id><name>Super Mario Bros. Special</name><description>OverviewReleased solely in Japan, Super Mario Bros. Special was intended to improve upon the original by making it significantly more difficult.   New levels, new enemies, a flick-screen system instead of scrolling levels.  Hudson Soft made away with most of the original.  New Enemies Tarusar  Sigebou  Chokichoki  Nakaji  Tsurara New Items Hachisuke - Resembles the bee from the Hudson logo. If Mario picks it up, he will be awarded 8,000 points.  Hammer - The same power-up from Donkey Kong. It even behaves similarly.  Clock - Adds one hundred seconds to the clock.  Wing - Much like the P-wing from Super Mario Bros. 3 Lucky Star - Found only in World 4-1. If Mario collects it, all enemies on the screen will be killed.    </description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2479345-smbs.jpg</image></root>
