<root><id>5534</id><name>Luminous Arc</name><description> Luminous Arc, released in 2007 in NA, was Imageepoch's first mainstream success and already spawned a sequel. The story revolves around Alph and his friends, who have been trained since young by the Arc Knight Heath to be a force of witch-slaying soldiers operating for the Church of Luminous in anticipation of the rebirth of witches into the world. Players take command of the group in a similar fashion to games such as Final Fantasy Tactics's battle system. Gameplay is similar to most turn-based strategy games currently released and can be controlled either with the stylus or the d-pad and other buttons. There are also gameplay elements unique to the game that add more depth to the gameplay such as Flash Drives, which are special attacks performed by each character.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21163">Luminous Arc 2</game><game id="1520">Fire Emblem</game><game id="12869">Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis</game><game id="22990">Blue Dragon Plus</game><game id="21400">Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume</game><game id="24207">Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice</game><game id="21642">Knights in the Nightmare</game><game id="1148">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</game><game id="5239">Battles of Prince of Persia</game><game id="21286">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</game><game id="17276">Rebelstar: Tactical Command</game><game id="24252">Hero's Saga Laevatein Tactics</game><game id="27921">Mage Knight: Destiny's Soldier</game><game id="3368">Summon Night 2</game><game id="18876">Summon Night</game><game id="22933">Bleach: The 3rd Phantom</game><game id="28180">Dawn of Heroes</game><game id="27338">Spectral Force Genesis</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478664-box_la.png</image></root>
