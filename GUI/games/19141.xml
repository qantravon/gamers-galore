The player is required to enter a specific code at the "Self-Introduction" option in the Profile menu.Legendary Pokemon BanningWith a lack of rules and controls in the online multiplayer function players who had "Legendary" pokemon had an unfair advantage over other players. Nintendo normally has tournament rules in places which would ban these pokemon but didn't initially implement these rules in Pokemon Battle Revolution. But on July 3rd, 2007 the rules changed to ban these pokemon. But for some reason the ban has recently been lifted and Legendary Pokemon are allowed once again in online play.Similar problems have occurred in other Pokemon titles and Nintendo stated the ban is "technically difficult".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="23375">Gangway Monsters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2171276-box_pkmnbr.png</image></root>
