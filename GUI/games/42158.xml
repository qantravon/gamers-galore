City Life gives you the reins of a whole city and entrusts you a simple yet difficult mission: manage every single aspect of your city and make it a great place to live. You can choose to play either in Scenario mode, where you begin your career with an already built city, or in Free mode, in which you start building everything up from scratch. Whatever playing mode you choose, you must take care of every single detail: power factories to light up streets, residential areas for citizens, companies and firms for them to work, shopping areas, hospitals, schools and of course, traffic and public transportation. As you can imagine, you'll need loads of concentration and a good strategy if you want to succeed as virtual major. Man, I never knew running a city was that hard!

But that's not all: City Life includes another challenge, this time involving citizens themselves. They're categorized in different social classes and you'll need to have that into account when building residential areas if you don't want demonstrations and riots going on everyday.

Gameplay is quite easy: most actions are performed with the mouse, plus menus are simple and clear. I especially enjoyed the ability to zoom in up to street level, so that you can actually walk along the inhabitants of your city. On the downside, moving around the map is not that intuitive and I couldn't find a way to change perspective with the mouse, which is far more comfortable than they keyboard.

City Life 2008 lets you build the city of your dreams, but be aware that this involves a lot of work!</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10960-1.jpg</image></root>
