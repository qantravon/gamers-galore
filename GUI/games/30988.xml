Building off its promise of being without equal, the game is set in a “steam powered” world. The player will be  able to take advantage of strange and ridiculously fun sounding  gadgetry, to help in annihilating enemies and blowing through in-game  obstacles. Other game features include seeking out high pressure steam  outlets to supercharge your equipment, thus allowing you to cause chaos  on an even larger scale. “We are proud to announce our new project,” began   Andreas Speer, the  CEO at Spellbound, “Spellbound has been creating successful brands and  projects for over 15 years. Our products have always been and continue  to be exemplary in the domain of creativity, aesthetic quality and art  style. Our“steam powered” approach brings a completely refreshing and  surprising value to the fantasy action genre. We are very excited about  our new project and delighted by the strong interest that it is  attracting.”</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/49877/1346312-ravensdale_orc_gunner.jpg</image></root>
