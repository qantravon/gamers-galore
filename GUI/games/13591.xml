The two opposing teams consist of three athletes each which can be chosen from a selection of available athletes, which come with different stats. The aim of the sport is to hit a target with the ball (approx. the size of a baseball). The target however is very small and also moving up and down on a pole. The players can pass the ball to each other which might result in losing the ball to the other team as well.  The look of the game is distinctively 'spacy' and you can see the stars and some planets from the open air stadium. Also, the athletes are all wearing spacesuits with which they are flying around the stadium.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13768">Speedball</game><game id="289">Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</game><game id="3313">Deathrow</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1705165-264276_hypaball_commodore_64_screenshot_it_s_about_to_cross_to_the.png</image></root>
