It is their job to control most aspects of the American government, ranging from foreign affairs to the budget to military deployments and war.  There is no set endgame or concrete goal in Shadow President, but the presidency can end in a number of ways.  If, at the end of your four year term, your popularity with the Amercan public is too low, you will lose the election, ending the game.  Assuming you win the election, there is no term limit, as opposed to the American 2-term limit.  It is also possible for a foreign nation or internal agitators to assassinate you, which becomes more likely the more belligerent you are with other countries.  The only other way to lose is to be impeached, which occurs when your popularity falls too low, which can happen for any number of reasons.  </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21645">Europa Universalis: Rome</game><game id="1594">Sid Meier's Civilization III</game><game id="21384">The Political Machine 2008</game><game id="19368">CyberJudas</game><game id="6676">DEFCON: Everybody Dies</game><game id="40982">The Third World War</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1759101-shadowpresidentboxart.jpg</image></root>
