Homes, apartments and offices are included in the different variety of play areas. Environments can be as realistic or unrealistic as possible. The player will select the structure's style, shape and the number of rooms. Choose color schemes, furniture and decorations as you see fit. Once done creating, "walk around" inside and experience the excitement of having created a place of your very own!</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11244/1481580-584426_116757.jpg</image></root>
