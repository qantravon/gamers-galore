Instead, this game is an RPG told through the eyes of Kyo Kusanagi during the events in-between the King of Fighters '96 and King of Fighters '97 tournaments. The battle system is very much alike the Megaman Battle Network series of games with players controlling spaces and picking moves from a list per turn.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8238">Mega Man Battle Network</game><game id="5113">Mega Man Battle Network 2</game><game id="13189">Mega Man Battle Network 3</game><game id="3384">Mega Man Battle Network 4</game><game id="12540">Mega Man Battle Network 5</game><game id="9824">Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS</game><game id="7995">Mega Man Battle Network 6</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1614/841011-kof_kyo_ps_jp.jpg</image></root>
