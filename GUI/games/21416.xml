In order to access the levels you have to pay to get into the house. The game has nonlinear level progression, since you can choose which one you want to go into as long as you have enough money to go into them. Unfortunately, there are certain items you can get in some levels that you need to progress through other levels, like the fire stage.In the levels, you don't necessarily just plow through until you find the end, it's more of an exploration game. You have to make your way around different parts of the level to find the different boss ghosts in the level.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370582-genesis_ghostbusters.jpg</image></root>
