It runs at a snail's pace, but many of the elements of the RPG are already there - statistics, experience, gold, dungeon exploration and the rest. Truly, if it had better marketing, the sub-genre would be known as  Apple Manor-likes.The game was re-released in 1982 in a 'special edition' with enhanced graphics.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22309">Rogue</game><game id="25832">Dungeon Campaign / Wilderness Campaign</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/101045/1439170-am1.png</image></root>
