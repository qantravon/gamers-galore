Their unique vehicle is the Get-a-Way Wagon, and their All-Star Move is Blimp Strike, in which whichever brother is shorter rises up to a blimp above the wagon and lobs bombs at the racers behind the brothers. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30093">Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</game><game id="4423">Keystone Kapers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2369749-genesis_bonanzabros_eu.jpg</image></root>
