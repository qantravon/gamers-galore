<root><id>37570</id><name>Star Trek: Borg Assimilator</name><description>Star Trek: Borg Assimilator was meant to be a           real-time strategy game, the first set in the  Star Trek universe, an honour which instead fell to  Star Trek: New Worlds. The player, representing the        Borg Collective, would build an empire by assimilating worlds and resources to make the Collective stronger, with the ultimate goal of the campaign being to create a stable       Omega Molecule and conquer the Alpha Quadrent, defeating the    Federation of United Planets, the     Klingon Empire, and the      Cardassian Union, among other popular species, in the process. Â Unlike most  cancelled games, which fall apart during development or prove to be too costly to finish,  Borg Assimilator was purposely shelved after it was realized that a game where the Borg succeed in assimilating all sentient life in the galaxy, even an explicitly non-canon one, was much too dark for the shining beacon of hope that the  Star Trek franchise was always meant to represent.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2263943-stba.jpg</image></root>
