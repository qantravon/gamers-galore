Jump, run and fight your way through 160 levels and kill all of the members of the League of Evil.Faux-RetroLeague of Evil sports a class 8bit style and has a chiptune soundtrack to match the art. Not only does League of Evil have the style and soundtrack of a game made in the 1990s, it also has the difficulty level of those classic games.
