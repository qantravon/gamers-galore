As a bit of an in-joke, Al Lowe and Sierra skipped 4 entirely. The end result is a point-and-click adventure that features alternating takes between Larry Laffer, the series' protagonists, and his love interest from Leisure Suit Larry 3, Passionate Patty. The game crossed into new territory for the series. It was the first icon-based game in the series, and featured gameplay that wouldn't allow Larry or Patty to die or render the game unbeatable.The narrative also shifts from previous games. The game's story became almost episodic, with a few overarching ties in the plot. This time around, Larry works as a field reporter for a sleazy porn video company, seeking out new models for his boss. Alternately, Patti has become an undercover FBI agent, investigating record companies for claims of subliminal messaging. The two have little interaction until the later parts of the game. Gamers would spend some time with one character, completing their particular goal (or in Larry's case, scoring), completing that particular part of the game, and then switch to the other character.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16771">King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder</game><game id="3019">The Secret of Monkey Island</game><game id="7745">Les Manley in: Lost in L.A.</game><game id="11852">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</game><game id="21174">Full Throttle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/712046-larry5.jpg</image></root>
