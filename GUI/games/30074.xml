The game's story is a prequel to the comic from which the game is inspired in the world of Hollow Wish. You can buy Kit new costumes and you get to play 3 levels with Noot.Blade Kitten was set to be a two-part episodic game, with the original release being the first episode. Sadly, however, the game did not sell well enough to warrant a second game.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24739">Trine</game><game id="34034">Rochard</game><game id="33981">A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1531998-bk_box.png</image></root>
