Like its predecessor, it is a straightforward baseball simulation game for the Famicom. Unlike Bases Loaded or R.B.I. Baseball the series has no American equivalent.Besides a roster update and a few graphical improvements there is little difference between this and the previous game in the series. This process of having minor incremental improvements between annual releases would eventually become common practice in console sports games.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8283">Bases Loaded</game><game id="611">R.B.I.
