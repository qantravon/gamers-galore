It features a large selection of Hot Wheels branded cars and tracks for players to race on. Each track contains a number of jumps that launch players into the air so they can perform stunts, all of which earns them turbo. In addition to providing a short boost of speed, turbo can allow a player to unlock hidden shortcuts, some of which contain "Mystery Cars" that unlock a new car for them after the race is over. There are other places hidden on tracks accessible by means other than turbo as well.The Playstation version consisted of a full licensed soundtrack, with an edited-for-content version of Metallica's Fuel in the intro video. Due to cartridge size limits, the N64 version did not have the same soundtrack.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7582">Hot Wheels: Extreme Racing</game><game id="15349">Hot Wheels: Ultimate Racing</game><game id="3632">Hot Wheels: World Race</game><game id="6196">Crash Team Racing</game><game id="13178">Speed Punks</game><game id="21285">Rollcage Stage II</game><game id="36062">Nitronic Rush</game><game id="40779">Distance</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2484700-box_hwtr.png</image></root>
