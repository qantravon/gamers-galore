Depending on your actions, the story branches out in different arcs. Mostly this is done by succeeding at a mini game, or simply nodding or shaking your head when the girl asks a question.Real Kanojo is one of the few games which you can play with a webcam - which interprets the player shaking his head saying yes or no - or by plugging in a second mouse, each mouse functioning as the left and right hand of the player.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22041">Artificial Girl 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/45471/1295691-real_kanojo_t44.jpg</image></root>
