The game's levels feature branching pathways, jumps and other obstacles that must be traversed as the player battles to recollect stolen gems.The game could be played by one player with the Super Scope, or by two players, with the second controlling Yoshi's movement with a controller.Historical NotesYoshi's Safari was the first game released in western territories to refer to Princess Peach by her original name. All prior Mario games released in western territories that featured the princess had her name changed to Princess Toadstool.Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 6,6,7,7 and 4 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 4 out of ten, wrote, "After playing this for a while you will want to turn the SuperScope on yourself and end it all! Yoshi's Safari suffers from one fatal flaw -- it is way too easy. The scrolling and graphics are excellent, but that is it!".</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="16218">Battle Clash</game><game id="3484">Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/783149-game_7.jpg</image></root>
