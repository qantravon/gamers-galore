As the title suggests, the game doesn't take place in Europe, like several other games in the franchise, but in Asia against the Japanese forces.You play as Cpl. Joseph Griffin of the US Marine Corps. The game starts off with the attacks on Pearl Harbour and to help out, you man anti-aircraft guns and shoot planes down. From there, you ship out over to Asia after War is declared on Japan. You will then find yourself in several different locations in Asia as the game progresses. The environments are tropical and not at all like what you may be used to seeing in World War 2 games, but there is a standard gray aircraft carrier and an office building level at the end of the single-player game.New to the Medal of Honor franchise are jungle based levelsRising Sun plays like previous titles in the series and you can expect much of the same kind of gameplay that Medal of Honor has offered in the past, just in a different environment and fighting a different enemy. Like all early Medal of Honor games, the "aim" button simply zooms in slightly, unlike Call of Duty and similar games that have the player look down the iron sights.LevelsMission 1: Day of InfamyMission 2: Pearl HarborMission 3: Fall of the PhilippinesMission 4: Midnight Raid on GuadalcanalMission 5: Pistol Pete ShowdownMission 6: Singapore SlingMission 7: In search of Yamashita's GoldMission 8: A Bridge over the River KwaiMission9: Super carrier SabotageMultiplayerMedal of Honor: Rising Sun had both online and offline multiplayer and featured 2 online modes, Deathmatch, a free for all, and Team Deathmatch, where two teams face off against each other to see which team can get the most kills.
