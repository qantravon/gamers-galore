Kao is one of the first critters rounded up by the pirates in Barnaba's service, but, thanks to some timely help from a clumsy parrot, he's also the first one set free. After stepping off the boat, Kao finds himself in the dark docks, which act as a hub for the six worlds that he must visit. Each world follows the typical adventure game layout, consisting of three or four large levels followed by a boss battle at the end.The game features typical 3D platforming formula. The main goal in each level is to reach the end, which consists of jumping between platforms, triggering switches and using weapons and vehicles to do so. Furthermore, each of his moves can be upgraded by collecting the stars that are scattered generously throughout each level. Interactive objects, like springboards and overhead rope bridges, also give you something else to do besides running and jumping.Also Scripted story scenes happen frequently to set up environmental calamities, chase sequences, and boss battles.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4966">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</game><game id="7836">Spyro the Dragon</game><game id="10920">Banjo-Kazooie</game><game id="2871">Banjo-Tooie</game><game id="2931">Super Mario 64</game><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game><game id="68">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</game><game id="8660">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</game><game id="15000">Donkey Kong 64</game><game id="6782">Sonic 3D Blast</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803965-box_kao2.png</image></root>
