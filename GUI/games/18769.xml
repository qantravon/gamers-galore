<root><id>18769</id><name>Lemmings X-Mas</name><description>OverviewXmas Lemmings, also known as Christmas Lemmings, are two games released by DMA Design in 1991 and 1992. Both games were freely-available demos, with four levels each, released as "Christmas gifts" to fans of Lemmings from DMA.The gameplay was identical to the original Lemmings and Oh No! More Lemmings, but with entirely new levels, and graphics that were altered to give it a Christmas theme. Imagery included snow, Christmas lights, snowmen, gingerbread houses, and presents. The music was replaced with MIDI versions of classic Christmas tunes, like "Jingle Bells" and "Good King Wenceslas".LegacyLemmings returned to the Christmas world once more with Christmas Lemmings 1993 and Christmas Lemmings 1994 (which were known as Holiday Lemmings 1993/94 in the United States). These games, unlike their predecessors, were full retail releases, with 32 levels for 1993 and 64 levels for 1994.Another demo with a similar concept was released in 1995, as 3D Lemmings Winterland. This game was an expansion to 3D Lemmings instead of the original, and had only four levels again.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24884">Rolando</game><game id="31798">Swarm</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/837751-lemmam0f.jpg</image></root>
