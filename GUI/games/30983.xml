Cartoons created could be up to five minutes long, and could be recorded to VCR to save them.  While similar to games like Videomotion or Color a Dinosaur, this game featured more customization and the ability to make cartoons. </description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5504">Color a Dinosaur</game><game id="29437">Videomation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/37521/1345273-tinytoonworkshopnes.jpg</image></root>
