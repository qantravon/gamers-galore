It is one of the earliest entries in the survival horror genre, if not the very first. The game is also one of the sources of inspiration that would influence the design of the original Resident Evil. Many elements seen in Sweet Home are also present in the latter horror title, including the isolated mansion setting, use of puzzles, and the door animations that Resident Evil used for its loading screens.PlotThe plot of the game focuses on a team of five people that enter Lady Mamiya's mansion in order to photograph her frescoes for a documentary. However, when they step inside, the doors shut behind them and they become trapped in what they soon learn is a haunted house. The team must then work together to escape before they become victims of the angered spirits within.GameplayUnlike Resident Evil and other modern survivial horror titles, Sweet Home was structured as a horror-themed RPG. The characters in the player's party earn experience from winning turn-based battles and can level up. However, if a character runs out of hit points, they are killed permanently. The game features multiple endings that are dependent on how many party members survive through to the end.Each of the party members also has a unique skill that they are able to perform. The effects of all of these character-specific skills are required to progress through the game, but in the event that any character is killed, there are items that will allow other characters to use the skill of the fallen party member.CharactersKazuoThe team leader and producer of the documentary.
