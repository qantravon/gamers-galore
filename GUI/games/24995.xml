<root><id>24995</id><name>Forza Motorsport 3</name><description>OverviewA race in Forza 3.Forza Motorsport 3 is the next racing game in the     Forza series from     Turn 10 Studios. The single-player portion of the game is a career mode that features a dynamic calendar. The game decides which of the 200 events it thinks they player would like to compete in based on their skill level and the types of cars they like to use. Modes include Oval Racing, Drag Racing, Circuit Racing, Drift Competitions, and Time Attack. The "cover car" for the game is Audi's new roadster, the Audi R8. It is being featured heavily in promotional videos and articles for the game put out by Turn 10.At Forza 3's official reveal at     E3 it was announced that the game will release sometime in October 2009, running at 720p and 60 frames per second. The game will also include a new cockpit view, one stick driving, more car customization, a video editor, and the ability to upload HD videos, most likely to forzamotorsport.net, similar to how Halo 3 players can upload their videos to Bungie.net.Forza Motorsport 3 comes on two discs, the first disc containing the core game and the second containing extra cars and tracks. Disc 2 is transferred to the hard drive for use on Disc 1.DemoA demo hit the    Xbox Live Marketplace on September 24th, 2009. Its features include the cock-pit view, damage modeling with rollover, and rewinding. The available demo track is Camino Viejo.The five cars playable in the demo are:2007 Porsche #80 Flying Lizard 911 GT3-RSR2010 Audi R8 5.2 FSi Quattro2009 Ferrari California2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X GSR2009 Mini John Cooper WorksFeatures2 discs (Disc 1 - Game Disc, Disc 2 - Extra Cars and Tracks)400 cars from over 50 manufacturers100 tracksRuns in 720p @ 60fps"Rewind" feature, activated by pressing the BACK button on the Xbox 360 controller. You can rewind to a specific point in a race and redo that section. This feature can be used to undo a crash or retake a turn with a better line."One Button Driving". Forza 3 introduces 'auto-braking', which allows you to steer and keep one finger on the gas, while the game takes care of the rest for you.  Xbox LIVE  leaderboards for racers and the most prolific car tuners and painters in the community.The Season mode features guidance and voice-overs by Peter Egan.Online Race Rules Editor, Allows the player to manipulate the game rules. Change the number of laps, Which driving assists can be used, What class cars, etc.A new party system that allows players to hop into one room and then jump from race to race together.Manual with a clutch, Hold left bumper to engage the clutch. Then you shift, then let off of the clutch. There is a missed shift if you don't hit it right. You can damage the car if you miss a shift with simulation damage on. The manual with clutch is faster than manual and automatic.Auto-Upgrade system. Adds parts to a car based on what class you want it to upgrade to. It will upgrade the car to as close to the top of the Performance Index of the class you choose.You can now roll your car over in single player and multiplayer races. Cars will be able to be flipped back over after a roll by using the analog sticks.Drift Scoring System. There is no "drift mode", drift points will be awarded during regular races, as all races record the player's drift performance "in the background." However, only Drift Points will win Drift events.New Performance Index (PI) system. All cars get a PI rating including R classes. Production cars will now be able to upgrade to and through the R classes. PI is based on the ability of the car not the ability of the AI's to drive it.Career ModeForza 3's new career mode will be two things; dynamic and accessible. The career mode will let you have several chances is customizing your own experience; Whether that be by adjusting assists or more subtly by picking a car. After your test drive with the Audi R8 the game will give you a choice of seven cars and the car you pick will determine your future races and your future prize cars. Each race will award you driver experience (like     Forza 2) and again will award you with car experience, however unlike its predecessor Forza 3 will award you a new car with each driver level you achieve until level 50. And these cars awarded to you will differentiate depending on your previous decisions in the career mode. Career mode will also feature 220 events including: Asian Manufacturer Open, Nissan Infiniti's Owners Meeting, Executive Car Open, English Car Elite etc etc... Similar to Forza 2 these races will differentiate on Make, Model, Residing Country, Horsepower, Engine type and position as well as Car class and race types: Rally races will be included for the first time in the Forza series.TracksCamino Viejo de Montserrat, one of the over 100 tracks featured in the game.Suzuka CircuitSebring International RacewayNÃ¼rburgring NordschleifeCamino Viejo de MontserratLadera Test TrackLe MansIberian International CircuitSilverstone International CircuitMazda Raceway Laguna SecaTsukuba CircuitTwin Ring MotegiMaple Valley RacewayCircuit de CatalunyaAutodromo Internazionale del MugelloSedona Raceway ParkRoad AmericaRoad AtlantaAmalfi CoastFujimi KaidoSunset PeninsulaNew York CircuitVehiclesTurn 10 was unable to fit all the contents of Forza Motorsport 3 on a single DVD, so the game was divided into two discs. Disc 1 includes the main game, around 300 cars, and most of the tracks. Disc 2 contains another 104 cars and 29 tracks, split up into four packs. Players with the required amount of space (1.9 GB) on their Xbox 360 Hard Drive will be able to completely install the contents on Disc 2, which Disc 1 will be able to read and integrate into the game seemlessly. If players do not have enough space on their hard drive or use Xbox 360 Memory Units, they will be able to choose which of the four packs they want to install. If not installed onto the hard drive or memory unit, the content will not be available in either the single player or multiplayer.Cars on disc 12008Acura#15 Lowe's Fernandez ARX-01b2008Acura#26
