<root><id>6879</id><name>Fight Club</name><description>Story ModeThe story mode centers around a character original to the game, named only Hero, who joins Fight Club after breaking up with his girlfriend. By winning fights, the character moves up through the ranks of Fight Club and Project Mayhem to become Tyler Durden's right-hand man. The levels are also designed around scenes from the movie, such as Lou's bar and Paper Street. In a bizarre twist that was highly criticized, winning story mode unlocks Fred Durst, lead singer from Limp Bizkit, as a playable character. Abraham Lincoln is also an unlockable character, which is likely a nod to the scene in the film where Tyler Durden says he'd like to fight him.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285649-box_fclub.png</image></root>
