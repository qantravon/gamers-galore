<root><id>3209</id><name>Magicland Dizzy</name><description>Magicland Dizzy is a direct sequel to Fantasy World Dizzy, where once again all of Dizzy's friends have been enchanted in some way and Dizzy must cure them. It is, like Fantasy World Dizzy and the others in the core DIzzy series, a platformer with several adventure game puzzles to solve.Â Notably, Magicland was not created by the Oliver Twins, as they were busy with other projects for Codemasters. It was instead designed by Neal Vincent and coded by outside developers Big Red Software, with oversight approval from the Oliver Twins.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/826/612069-dizzy4.jpg</image></root>
