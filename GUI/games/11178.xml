GameplayScenariosPlayers are challenged to an all-new list of scenarios in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.

Scenario EditorOne of the notable new additions RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 brings to the series is the scenario editor. With the editor, players can create a landscape the size of their choosing and modify its terrain to their liking to create their very own scenarios to play themselves or share with others. The editor gives players full customization options, allowing them to edit the starting park to their desire, pick an objective, designate which attractions will be available to choose from, specify the maximum loan amount, and so on.AttractionsThe key to building a successful amusement park in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is still the rides. Without a diverse selection of quality rides guests will not be happy with their visit, so maintaining a balance of exciting gentle and extreme rides is essential to maximizing guest satisfaction. Each ride has three ratings tied to it:Excitement Rating - How exciting a ride is, and how likely guests are to ride it. This is not only determined by the design of the ride, but also the scenery and landscaping around the ride.Intensity Rating - How intense or scary a ride is. This will affect how likely guests are to ride, depending on their ride intensity preferences. It is determined by the physical aspects of the ride, such as G-force and average speed.Nausea Rating - How nauseating a ride is. The higher this is, the more easily guests will get sick on it.Manage Six Flags parks with replicas of real rides, like the Texas GiantIn addition to the ratings rides also have data associated with them, such as popularity, reliability, and run costs. It is important to take note of each ride's stats, as a ride that brakes down too often or is not popular enough may not be worth running, or might need to be replaced as it ages.Rides can be colored to the players' desire, and some rides have customization options such as rotation speed or number of trains on the track, some of which might affect the ride's ratings.In addition to rides, shops and stalls are the other key attractions for a park. Guests require food and drink stalls to stay full and hydrated, and bathroom stalls for when nature calls. A lack of any of these will decrease guest happiness drastically. Among other things, other kiosks are available to sell park maps and umbrellas, which not only provide guests with essentials to their time in the park, but also can become good revenue creators. Track DesignerRoller coasters and other tracked rides can be custom-designed using the track designer (though there is also a selection of pre-designed tracks to choose to build from). The designer lets player lay out track pieces individually so that they can create their very own unique coasters and rides. It allows players to choose the direction, slope, bank, and height of each piece, as well as offering the player a variety of other roller coaster elements, such as vertical loops, corkscrews, and helices. Each ride has different options depending on their capabilities. Once a ride is completed, the player can test it to ensure it runs properly and it will be given its ratings, allowing the player to modify it to improve them or open it up for business. GuestsKeeping current guests satisfied and attracting new guests is one of the player's ultimate goals as a park manager. Guests have unique names and desires. Some enjoy extreme rides, others do not, and some guests get nauseous far easily than others. All guests also have five dynamic traits that will change throughout their time in the park:Happiness - The more unhappy they are, the more likely they are to leave. Extremely unhappy guests are likely to vandalize the park by destroying benches, trash cans, and lamps.Energy - Tired guests are more likely to become unhappy, and look for more exciting rides to help keep them energized.Hunger - The hungrier they get, the more unhappy they become. It is important to have an abundance of food stalls placed around the park.Thirst - Similarly to hunger, the thirstier they get, the more unhappy they become. It is important to have an abundance of drink stalls placed around the park.Bathroom - It is vital to have plenty of bathrooms around the park for guests to relieve themselves, as well as to allow sick guests to have a place to vomit so they don't do it on the pathways. A shortage of bathrooms will lead to very unhappy guests.Players can click on individual guests to see their current thoughts and current mood. Guests will often give good or bad feedback depending on where they are in the park and how they feel about it. It is important to listen to this feedback and make necessary changes depending on how many guests make certain complaints. The player has the option to also rename guests and pick them up and place them anywhere within the park. Players can view all the guest thoughts and actions at once in the park guests window.The guest AI has been reworked from the original game to make guests smarter. They will now no longer get lost on paths that are wider than a single square unit, saving the player the frustration of dealing with lost guests. Easter Egg NamesChanging a guest's name to any of the following will have these effects:Andy Hine - Compares all roller coasters to "the Phoenix"Chris Sawyer - Takes pictures of the parkDamon Hill - Rides Go Karts really, really fastElissa White - Remarks on the ride manufacturer Intamin when on a ride designed by themJohn Wardley - Gets impressed with the park really easilyKatie Brayshaw - Waves at other guestsMelanie Warn - Becomes extremely happyMichael Schumacher - Rides Go Karts really fastMr Bean - Rides Go Karts really, really slowSimon Foster - Paints pictures StaffAs part of the player's duties as manager they must hire several kinds of staff members in order to keep their park running smoothly and cleanly:Handymen - Keep the park clean and tidy. They can clean paths, empty garbage bins, water gardens, and mow overgrown grass. Players can choose for each handymen to perform only certain tasks. Their default uniform color is red.Mechanics - Ensure the rides in the park continue to operate safely and without error. They can inspect rides at a player-set interval, and are called to fix rides when they brake down. If rides are not inspected regularly they run a greater risk of braking down or even crashing. Their default uniform color is blue.Security Guards - Help stop angry guests from vandalizing the park. Their default uniform color is yellow.Entertainers - Keep guests entertained along pathways and while waiting in queues. Their default costume is a panda.Each kind of staff type can wear a uniform color (or, for entertainers, a different kind of costume) of the player's choice, and each individual staff member can be told to patrol certain areas of the park as designated by the player. LandscapingExperiment with new ride and scenery optionsThe player has several tools at their disposal to alter the landscape of their park, whether it be raising the height to create hills, adding water, changing its terrain, or removing/adding trees and other scenery. Sometimes this is necessary in order to make room to build more rides, or to simply make the land more eye-catching.Some parks also allow expansion by giving the player the ability to buy more land or construction rights over property not owned by them. Scenery EditingPossibly the other most significant addition to the series is the addition of several tools to make placing and modifying scenery more extensive. The new system allows players to adjust the height placement of scenery objects, which greatly increases player options when designing unique and complex scenery pieces. For instance, custom buildings can now be created with ease by building high walls and roofs quickly using the new tools. A bulldozer tool also lets players delete multiple pieces of scenery quickly and at once. PathsGuests' main way of travel around the park will be with paths. Using an array of different path types, it is the player's job as the manager to create a path system around their park that is easy for guests to navigate and has access to all areas and attractions of the park. Like rides, paths can be elevated above and tunneled below ground. Each ride must have a path attached to its exit and a special path called a queue attached to its entrance. Guests line up in a queue to wait for a ride. If a queue is too long, guests will get tired of waiting in line, while if it's too short it will be too difficult for guests to get in line before it gets full. FinancesEverything the player does while managing their park will cost money, so a profitable budget must be maintained. There are two different kinds of parks: pay to enter and pay to ride. Pay to enter parks have a one-time entrance free that guests pay as they enter the park, and all rides are free. Pay to ride parks have no entrance free, and instead guests must pay for each individual ride. All fees are player controlled and should be change throughout the park's history as the park grows and costs more to run. Food, drinks, and souvenirs are also important revenue generators.Proper budgeting is essential for a successful parkWhen budgeting, players should take into account the costs of running each ride and stall in their park, the cost of their staff, how much money they will need for future expansions, and so on. If the player desires, they can take out a loan to meet their immediate financial needs and pay it off later. The player can also choose to invest in researching new rides or stalls to add even further variety to their options when designing their park, as not all attractions are always available to players in the scenarios (with the exception of Mega Park). It is possible to fall into debt, so it is important to maintain a steady income and ensure new guests are attracted to the park.
