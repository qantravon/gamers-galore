(roughly "Special Sortie Department") is the second of the three Ultraman license games Bandai produced for the Famicom Disk System.Unlike the first game, which had the player control the eponymous gargantuan superhero, the sequel puts the player in charge of a Tokyo defense team of military experts who find ways of repelling kaiju (giant monsters) when Ultraman isn't around. This involves finding a way to hurt the monsters (a special cube, found somewhere on the map) and then deploying vehicles such as tanks and jets that are able to shoot them down before they destroy any critical buildings, like the local hospital. Though Ultraman himself can be called upon to help, he isn't required to complete the game.Ultraman 2 was actually released on the same day as Final Fantasy, and a day after Mega Man.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2329086-ultraman_2_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
