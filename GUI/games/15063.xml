The points are tallied and shown at the end of each event with the final total being given at the end of the game.Game PlayThe Activision Decathlon is a one-player only side-to-side game.This game uses a power meter for each event with power generated by quick side-to-side motion of the players joystick. The faster the side-to-side motion, the higher the power meter goes. Players must generate the highest amount of power possible for each event with some, such as running events, requiring power being generated as quickly as possible and then maintained until the finish of the race. Other events, such as jumping and throwing, require that the player generate the highest amount of power possible and then maintain that power while simultaneously pressing the joystick's button to achieve the furthest jumps and throws and the highest jumps and vaults. Maintaining the highest possible level of power while timing and pressing the button at the best possible moment can be quite challenging.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="42">Track &amp; Field</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11240">Summer Games</game><game id="12353">Summer Games II</game><game id="12273">Olympic Summer Games</game><game id="3426">The Games: Summer Challenge</game><game id="18232">Track &amp; Field</game><game id="3602">ESPN International Track &amp; Field</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366061-a5200_decathlon.jpg</image></root>
