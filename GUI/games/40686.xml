The game was released simultaneously across Android, iPad, and iPhone platforms on October 10, 2012. Polara is a cross between an endless runner and an action-platformer. Forced movement keeps the player character moving across the level, while the player controls her jumps and switches the color of her suit in response to obstacles. Blue obstacles are avoided with a blue suit, and red obstacles are avoided with a red suit. The game has a total of 50 levels (five of which are boss battles), along with six additional modes focused on running as long as possible without dying.The story mode follows an escaped girl named Agent Lara as she is guided by a mysterious man, eventually showing that their past is intertwined.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/2379076-mzm.hkorwmgg.175x175_75.jpg</image></root>
