The protagonist of the game will be Ezio Auditore Da Firenze, the main character in Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Ezio is traveling east to reach the former home of the order of assassins, Masyaf. There, he will discover the origins of the secret sect.CancellationIn an interview with Joystiq, published on July 14 2011, Assassin's Creed: Revelations lead writer Darby McDevitt revealed that Lost Legacy was scrapped and its story/gameplay elements were integrated into Revelations instead."You may have heard of the game 'Lost Legacy' for the 3DS. It was announced, but that kind of morphed into this [AC: Revelations] idea," McDevitt told Joystiq. "The story that was announced about Lost Legacy was that Ezio goes to Masyaf and investigates the holy land," he continued. This basically is the same or a very similar idea to where Revelations' story is headed. McDevitt also said that he started working on the story for Revelations in February 2010, before Lost Legacy was announced and quite a while before Brotherhood was even released.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93538/1552626-ac_lost_legacy.png</image></root>
