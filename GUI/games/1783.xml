Knutz Folly was built by the insane Baron Knutz and now Sweevo has to clean up after him by eliminating all of the strange life forms left behind.    Each level must be cleared of life forms to move on and requires a specific method to dispose of them. The Horrible Little Girls (or Minxes as they are known) can be disposed of by dropping a teddy bear on their head. There are also Goose Stepping Dictators, Widgers and Geese. Also around the levels are Brownies that can be collected to give the player extra Brownie points at the end of the level at which time the player is then rated on the tidiness he completed the game with.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11830">Hydrofool</game><game id="20013">Magnetik Tank</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1362244-sweevosworld_cassette.jpg</image></root>
