<root><id>6530</id><name>007: Everything or Nothing</name><description>OverviewThe Game was noted for its 3rd Person view and unique story.This was the second James Bond game to feature in a third-person perspective, and the very first Bond game to feature a cooperative mode. Everything or Nothing also marked Pierce Brosnan's last performance as James Bond in film and in video games. This version of Bond lacked an actual deathmatch unlike its previous installments, which had become standard after GoldenEye's success in 1997. Jaws from the classic Bond films reprises his role as the giant, silver-teethed villain for the first time with a different Bond actor. This installment includes 29 missions and 4 unlockable ones. It also brings back the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, which was featured in the Bond film Die Another Day.Gameplay consists of a mix of third person gunplay, vehicular combat and stealth segments. The player has access to an assortment of weapons (pistols, shotguns, assault rifles) which will be displayed on Bond depending on your most recent weapons of choice. Bond also has access to a variety of gadgets including coin grenades.Bond MomentsA predominant feature throughout the levels in Everything or Nothing focus on "Bond Moments". While venturing, you will come across certain objects that can be interacted with in a unique way that James Bond would actually do in order to trump the bad guys. A prime example is how you will fly a helicopter through a canyon to escape, and there will be bad guys on a rope-and-wood bridge firing weapons at you. You could use your turret gun to try and kill them all and just fly past them, or you could use a Bond moment that would shoot the bridge out. Another memorable Bond moment from the game involves sliding your motorcycle under the trailer of an 18-wheeler. The majority of these moments are noted with a special crosshair indicator and, in some cases, a context sensitive button press.VehiclesA handful of levels in Everything or Nothing feature vehicle chases. A variety of cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles make up the majority of these levels. Some use a slightly open-ended approach, while others offer a very linear pathway to move along.Chimera MotorcyclePorsche Cayenne Turbo (Also as RC)Triumph Daytona 600Peruvian TankVolotech TruckAston Martin V12 Vanquish (Also as RC)LimousineRally CarPlatinum TankWeaponsThe bulk of the gameplay consists of third person combat, and these are the weapons players will come across in the game.
