A psuedo-prequel to Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, the game that served as the base for the cult NES classic River City Ransom, Shodai - Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun has main character Kunio and his rival Riki going on a field trip with their class to Osaka. This being a beat-em-up game, something goes horribly wrong and the main characters must fight waves of enemies.Like River City Ransom, Shodai - Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun features RPG elements uncommon for beat-em-up titles in the early 90s. Players could converse with NPCs, earn experience points, learn new attacks, and collect items, among other things.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5423">Double Dragon II</game><game id="34840">GP Fight</game><game id="13147">Yakuza 2</game><game id="27256">Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2293296-shodai_nekketsu_kouha_kunio_kun.jpg</image></root>
