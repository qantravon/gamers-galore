<root><id>2</id><name>Breakfree</name><description>OverviewBreakfree, released in 1995 by Software Storm, Inc., is a first-person block-breaking game. The goal of the game is also its title--players must destroy the walls that surround them by bouncing projectiles into the walls. Like traditional block-breaking games, some blocks contain power-ups, and losing all of the projectiles means game over for the player.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="10852">Faceball 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1940/621001-1056454795_00.gif</image></root>
