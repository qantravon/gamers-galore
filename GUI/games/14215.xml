The game is a visual novel which follows the adventures of Nash Latkje during the events of Suikoden II. Suikogaiden Vol. 1 was developed by KCET for the PlayStation and Konami published it in Japan on September 21, 2000. Konami never localized Suikogaiden into English but a group of fans started the Suikogaiden Translation Project in 2008. The group dedicated almost fives years to creating an unofficial English localization of Suikogaiden until they finally released version 1.0 of their translation patch on March 22, 2013.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/24669/880233-3251129525_bd8f5b4cea.jpg</image></root>
