Players start with a small squadron of ships, to which they can add additional ships to by picking up 1UPs. They can expand formation to spread fire for devastating effect, or contract to avoid enemies and their bullets.Levels have branching paths. Occasionally, the player will get to a point where they can choose an easy or hard route. Players can also alter the difficulty by making firing and/or formation expanding automatic, and altering the speed of the game.Shoot 1UP supports off-line two-player co-op, off-line scoreboards, optional single-button play, and giant women with robotic breasts.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="21514">Spacewar!</game><game id="5536">Defender</game><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="24130">Astro Tripper</game><game id="22998">R-Type Dimensions</game><game id="19750">R-Type II</game><game id="7474">R-Type Final</game><game id="17155">R-Type DX</game><game id="8479">Super R-Type</game><game id="3458">R-Type III: The Third Lightning</game><game id="12487">Silver Surfer</game><game id="3984">Star Fox</game><game id="4527">Parsec</game><game id="5666">Falcon Patrol</game><game id="3838">Space Megaforce</game><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="3623">Gradius II</game><game id="5412">Darius+</game><game id="18719">Darius Gaiden</game><game id="32925">Chikyuu Kaihou Gun ZAS</game><game id="16079">Stinger</game><game id="34393">Eliminate Down</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31094/1287709-shoot1up_boxart_girl.jpg</image></root>
