It is the sequel to Super Mario Kart for the SNES and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from Mode 7 to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title.GameplayBowser in Mario Kart 64Mario Kart 64 can be a simple racer in order to appeal to a casual player, but offers more advanced techniques to keep a more experienced player interested. At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use drifting and Mario themed weapons and items such as Turtle Shells and Mushroom Boosts to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.The game is separated into four play types, Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial. In each of these modes you choose from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and you are tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If you achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, you are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a " ghost" of your best time, which is a translucent recording of your previous best lap.CharactersThe playable characters are:LightweightPlayer select screenToadPrincess PeachYoshiMiddleweightMarioLuigiHeavyweightDonkey KongWarioBowserLightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around.
