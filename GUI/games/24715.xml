Your goal is to reach a certain point in the level, usually requiring you to avoid obstacles and use physics to your advantage. The physics in the game is powered by the AGEIA physics engine, one specifically designed to handle complex physics. Because you control a drop of water, enemies and obstacles aren't what you usually expect and come in the form of paper towels, flies, bread, and even falling chocolate. The basic commands are WASD movement, camera control with the mouse, jump, double jump and grab.There are several different levels which you access by going through pipes from your central hub, a jumble of pipes in a sewer line. Levels are unlocked in order of completion, and as you gain new abilities. The 3 gameplay types are mission, petal and timed.PC System RequirementsOperating System: Windows XP, Vista or superiorProcessor: Pentium IV 1 GhzMemory: 512 MB RamHard Disk Space: 368 MBGraphic Card: ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 or equivalent (latest drivers installed)DirectX version: DirectX 9 with latest drivers installedSound: DirectX 9</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17983">Dewy's Adventure</game><game id="35697">Solar 2</game><game id="32560">Puddle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8812/828635-i_fluid_logo.jpg</image></root>
