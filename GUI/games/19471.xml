Fights take place within a large transparent cube that designates the level boundaries; however these can smash when an opponent is defeated. There are only three attack buttons in the game; a quick attack, a heavy smash attack, and an energy blast. The three of these can be combined to create simple combos.  The fighting also has a strong emphasis on special projectile attacks, the use of which consumes energy from a power bar that recharges while the character is motionless. While the fighting may seem simplistic, a greater priority in the gameplay is usually given to timing and avoiding these special moves.Characters  The game features eight characters, each of whom fight using a specific element - Burn Griffths - Psychic element: Fire  Keith Evans - Psychic element: Ice  Wendy Ryan - Psychic element: Wind  Emilio Michaelov - Psychic element: Light  Sonia - Psychic element: Electricity  Brad Kilsten - Psychic element: Gravity Richard Wong Â - Psychic element: Time  Gates Oltsman - A Cyborg who uses technological weapons to fight Rokudo Genma - A japanese warrior who fights using magic  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25109">Dragonball: Evolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/24077/820406-psychic_force_pal.jpg</image></root>
