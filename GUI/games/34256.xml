<root><id>34256</id><name>The Tiny Bang Story</name><description>OverviewWhen a giant meteor hits the Tiny Planet, it breaks into many pieces, and the peaceful life of its inhabitants is disrupted. The player's job is to restore it to normal by solving puzzles and fixing machines across the game's five chapters. This often entails collecting a certain number of gears, light bulbs, packages, and other such items, making the gameplay similar to a hidden object game. However, there are no confined "scenes", so the player must look for the objects in the actual environment.No text or speech is used in the game, which is unusual for the genre. This was done in order to make the game accessible to people of all ages and nationalities.Each screen is hand-drawn in a whimsical style reminiscent of Machinarium and Samorost.PC System RequirementsOS: Microsoft速 Windows速 XP SP1 or newerProcessor: 1.5 GHz equivalent or higher processorMemory: 512 MBHard disk space: 180 MBVideo: StandardDirectX速: DirectX速 9.0cSound: StandardMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: 1.5 Ghz Intel and aboveMemory: 512 MB RAMHard Disk Space: 180Mb</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23648">Machinarium</game><game id="12860">Samorost</game><game id="20343">Samorost 2</game><game id="35156">Lume</game><game id="35011">Botanicula</game><game id="43014">Morphopolis</game><game id="28518">Axel &amp; Pixel</game><game id="35010">Samorost 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2168361-562670e75255388d47bb23a78bb0da18.jpg</image></root>
