By playing through the single player challenges clothing such as headwear, shirts, pants, gloves, and footwear, can be unlocked. The player can use these unlocks to design and save up to three different fighter models.

This means that there is ultimately only one character-type to choose for fighting.This game was made free for users of the U.S. Playstation Store, courtesy of Sprint.
