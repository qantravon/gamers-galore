The player assumes the role of Sarge, the leader of the plastic Green Army in their quest to destroy the Tan Army. The game has basically the same story as the original Army Men. It leaves behind the over-the-head strategy gameplay of Army Men, Army Men II, and Army Men: Toys in Space, and instead goes with being a third person shooter. It is known for being difficult to see the enemies in the first few levels because the enemies are tan and blend into the background.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28325">Toy Soldiers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1799328-box_armymen3d.png</image></root>
