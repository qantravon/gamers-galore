The game was initially pitched on Kickstarter but failed to meet its target. Still hoping to crowdfund the game, Ambient began offering Death Inc. pre-orders on their website for $10. Players who pre-ordered got access to an early alpha. Less than 2 weeks later the studio shut down due to insufficient funds. The Death Inc. alpha is now free to download on Ambient's web site.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/27163/2409587-91.jpg</image></root>
