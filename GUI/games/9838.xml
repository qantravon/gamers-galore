This entry in the series was slower than many other racing games on the N64 at the time, instead of overcoming a pack of cars your car would often just pass a single car at a time. There were only five courses in the game but they each had various seasons and times of day that would change the look of the environment.  Courses would unlock as you progressed through the game; Island, Jungle, Desert and Mountain, with a fifth Industrial area course unlocked at the end of the championship.  Playing further years of the championship would unlock mirrored courses and non-standard weather conditions for each course. The game also featured a paint shop where you could paint your car however you wanted.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16283">F-1 Race</game><game id="2162">Sega Rally Championship</game><game id="15490">Xpand Rally</game><game id="1794">Colin McRae Rally</game><game id="12060">Stunt Racer 64</game><game id="10150">World Driver Championship</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2491488-box_tgr.png</image></root>
