<root><id>39250</id><name>Relics: Ankoku Yousai</name><description>OverviewRelics plays similarly to Metroid, in that the player controls an armor-clad warrior as they move through a maze of side-scrolling platforming areas. The player character can also destroy parts of the surrounding walls by hitting them, revealing machinery under the facade and occasionally useful items.Graphically and audibly quite impressive for a Famicom game, this has the unfortunate issue of requiring constant unavoidable load times which appear at every screen transition and occasionally while walking through larger rooms. The main character is also unwieldy to control, with turning around for instance being a two part process that takes several seconds to execute.The game was not released outside of Japan.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2286404-250px_relics_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
