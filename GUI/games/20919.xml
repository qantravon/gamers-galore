The game marks the first time non-Ford vehicles have appeared in the franchise, as Land Rover vehicles such as the Range Rover Stormer concept appear. This is understandable as, at the time of development and release, Ford owned Land Rover.As the game name would suggest, Ford Racing: Off Road takes place off road as opposed to the road tracks which appeared in previous titles. The game offers WLAN multiplayer, and eighteen licensed vehicles from Ford and Land Rover.Box ArtEU BoxartFord Racing: Off Road was released in Europe and in North America, featuring different box art designs for the two territories. The EU boxart focuses more on the Land Rover vehicles due to the majority of Ford's off road vehicles appearing only in North America, while the Range Rover line is available worldwide. In additiion it loses the Ford Racing logo in favor of displaying the two manufacturer logos with a completely different 'Off Road' design.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="13173">Ford Racing 2</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="12976">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="20741">Need for Speed: Undercover</game><game id="9651">Need for Speed Underground 2</game><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="8831">Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</game><game id="12395">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</game><game id="453">Need for Speed: High Stakes</game><game id="18021">Need for Speed: Carbon - Own the City</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="17784">Gran Turismo 4</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="8100">Gran Turismo 2</game><game id="21297">Gran Turismo HD</game><game id="7482">Gran Turismo Concept: 2001 Tokyo</game><game id="21390">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Seoul</game><game id="7313">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Geneva</game><game id="13895">Gran Turismo 4: Prologue</game><game id="1101">Ridge Racer 7</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="17599">Forza Motorsport</game><game id="8779">Sega GT 2002</game><game id="14428">Sega GT Online</game><game id="15965">Sega GT</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="788">The Fast and the Furious</game><game id="9927">SRS: Street Racing Syndicate</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="21307">Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="531">TOCA Race Driver 2</game><game id="5869">TOCA Touring Car Championship</game><game id="13734">TOCA Race Driver 3</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="6499">RalliSport Challenge 2</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="20858">NASCAR 09</game><game id="11055">NASCAR 08</game><game id="21724">NASCAR Racing 2002 Season</game><game id="8438">NASCAR 06: Total Team Control</game><game id="18428">NASCAR Thunder 2004</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="357">Burnout 3: Takedown</game><game id="16492">Burnout Revenge</game><game id="4970">Burnout Legends</game><game id="13514">Burnout 2: Point of Impact</game><game id="20484">Burnout</game><game id="8459">Burnout Dominator</game><game id="10149">Burnout: Championship Drag Racing</game><game id="15536">Ford Racing 3</game><game id="27007">Fireburst</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="8621">Hummer: Badlands</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/175865-942828_95115_front.jpg</image></root>
