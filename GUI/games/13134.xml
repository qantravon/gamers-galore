Mr. Firebird warns Putt-Putt not to touch the lever marked "Do not touch," but a series of unlikely events follow causing the lever to be thrown.After landing Putt-Putt manages to prove that there is gravity on the moon by falling off a bridge and into a river of green slime. Before his approaching death Putt-Putt is miraculously saved by a lunar rover, named Rover. Exchanging thanks, Putt-Putt is saddened to find that Rover was left behind on the last moon landing and now desperately yearns to go home to Earth. This encourages Putt-Putt to avoid any further shenanigans and find a way home quickly. He soon encounters a alien who is willing to exchange his hollowed rocket shell for a mere 10 glowing moon crystals. Putt-Putt is then informed that he must collect several other parts to get the rocket running; space fuel, a key, nose cone, and a steering wheel.LegacyWhile the game itself is not considered the high point of Humongous Entertainment, Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon spawned many sequels and was very popular among a younger audience during the 1990s. Created by Ron Gilbert, the Humongous brand enjoyed continued success until the end of the 1990s.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14824">Spy Fox in "Dry Cereal"</game><game id="14441">Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening</game><game id="3090">Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise</game><game id="14961">Pajama Sam: Life is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff</game><game id="2373">Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds</game><game id="15666">Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted School House</game><game id="9720">Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell</game><game id="10911">Freddi Fish 4: The Case of the Hogfish Rustlers of Briny Gulch</game><game id="18903">Pajama Sam: Games to Play on Any Day</game><game id="8430">Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When Itâ€™s Dark Outside</game><game id="19472">Fatty Bear's FunPack</game><game id="22727">Spy Fox in: Hold the Mustard</game><game id="17987">Pajama Sam: Lost and Found</game><game id="17824">Pajama Sam's SockWorks</game><game id="11852">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</game><game id="5449">Freddi Fish and Luther's Water Worries</game><game id="13067">Freddi Fish &amp; Luther's Maze Madness</game><game id="9805">Freddi Fish's One-Stop Fun Shop</game><game id="5729">The Curse of Monkey Island</game><game id="4372">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</game><game id="14743">Blue's 123 Time Activities</game><game id="14412">Blue's Reading Time Activities</game><game id="17810">Blue's Clues: Blue's Art Time Activities</game><game id="11848">Blue's ABC Time Activities</game><game id="5784">Blue's Treasure Hunt</game><game id="16775">Blue's Clues: Blue's Birthday Adventure</game><game id="13230">Grim Fandango</game><game id="16132">Moop and Dreadly in the Treasure on Bing Bong Island</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4938/617683-l10756109.jpg</image></root>
