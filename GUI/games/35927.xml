Critical ReceptionWhen released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores,  4,5,6,7 adding, "...This is a cute game that should appeal to a younger audience.  It  doesn't have the excitement of a kid's game and that could hurt it.  It  just offers flat game play and doesn't inspire me to continue farther  into the game.  The graphics, sound, action and everything is just  average. Not the best Turbo game ever made". </description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
