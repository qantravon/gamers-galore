You live alone in a small flat in   Slough, a suburb of London, England. Somehow you left school   without any qualifications to speak of, and you have a dead   end job that doesn't have much of a future. What are you going   to do with your life? and what will you have achieved by your   thirtieth birthday?Kudos is a turn based strategy game where you control someone's      life. You decide where they work, who they hang out with,      and what they do to relax. Do you want to be an alcoholic      saxophone playing taxi driver? or maybe a reclusive but brilliant      astrophysicist. Kudos is not about flashy graphics or high      polygon counts. Kudos is about exploring areas of gameplay      you haven't seen in mainstream games. Hopefully, Kudos is      pretty original."</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/228911-gfs_77887_2_2.jpg</image></root>
