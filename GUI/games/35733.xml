<root><id>35733</id><name>Just Dance Summer Party</name><description>OverviewJust Dance Summer Party is a party/dance game exclusively for the Wii. Known as Just Dance - Extra Songs in certain regions, this game is in fact an add on for Just Dance 2. Like for most Wii games, extra content can't be downloaded from the WiiShop because of a lack of memory space. Instead of releasing a disc with extra songs that can be copied to the original game, like EA did with  RockBand on Wii, Just Dance Summer Party is a stand alone expansion that does not require the original game.TracklistThe game comes with 20 tracks as well as two exclusive tracks when you buy the collector's edition.TracksA Band of Bees – Chicken PaybackBlur – Song 2Carl Douglas – Kung fu fighting ( Dave Ruffy / Mark Wallis remix)Estelle feat Kanye West – American BoyKaty Perry – FireworkM/A/R/R/S – Pump Up The VolumePanic At The Disco – Nine in the afternoonRihanna – Pon De ReplaySteppenwolf – Born To Be WildThe Supremes – You Can’t Hurry LoveV V Brown – Crying BloodCountdown Dee’s Hit Explosion – Barbie GirlLove Letter – Why oh whyNick Phoenix and Thomas Bergersen – Professeur PumplestickleStudio Allstars – ManiacSweat Invaders – Skin-to-SkinThe Hit Crew – Here Comes The HotstepperThe Lemon Cubes – Mambo NO. 5 (A Little Bit Of Monica)The Lemon Cubes – Moving On UpThe Reverend Horatio Duncan  Amos Sweets – Down By The RiversideThe World Cup Girls – Futebol CrazyBonus TracksA R Rahman, Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger – Jai Ho!
