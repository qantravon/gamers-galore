The title is being developed as a downloadable game for the         PSN and it is said to feature full 3D stereoscopic support.  Replika will be a single-player only game. StoryNot much is known at this point (March 2011), but one of the developers gave an interview in which he said You can expect a very dense storyline with allusions to military,  psychological and religious concepts. It’s more mature than what players  are used to in a game and it deals with very deep and  philosophical questions.  Other MediumsThe movie rights for Replika have been officially acquired and as such, a potential film is to be expected at some point in the future.Links       Official Website      Development Diary</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62890/1738885-replika_comiccon_small.jpg</image></root>
