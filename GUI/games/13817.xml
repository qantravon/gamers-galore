Though the player can chose between either protaganist the stories of each of the characters both occur at the same time and interwoven together. Though there is no major difference in terms of how each character is controlled.The New Nightmare has often been compared to the Resident Evil franchaise as it bares many resemblances such as the changing camera view as well as searching for ammo and health packs in order to survive.PortsGame Boy ColorAlone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color by Pocket Studios and was first released in Europe alongside its console counterparts on May 18, 2001. The port was later released in America on June 25, 2001.When Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color the handheld could not handle the 3D environments of the game, so the 3D was abandoned in favor of 2D sprites. The Game Boy Color received a relatively faithful port of the home console game. While the home console versions could be completed in six to eight hours, the Game Boy Color port could be completed in just one.FilmIn 2005, a film adaptation directed by infamous Uwe Boll was released based on the video game series. The movie was supposed to be a direct sequel to the fourth game in the series, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, although the movie has little-to-no relation to the original trilogy of games from the 1990s. The movie contains plot elements that directly contradict those in The New Nightmare, thus it is not considered canonical. The movie was named the "Lowest-Grossing Game Based Movie" in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 edition.PC Minimum System RequirementsWindows XP / Vista1 GHz processor (1.4 GHz recommended)256MB RAM (512MB recommended)3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)MouseKeyboard</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9775">Uninvited</game><game id="5842">Resident Evil</game><game id="584">Nightmare Creatures</game><game id="13168">Nightmare Creatures II</game><game id="21139">Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</game><game id="7225">Fatal Frame III: The Tormented</game><game id="4312">Silent Hill</game><game id="15993">Ecstatica</game><game id="27715">Resident Evil</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1867798-box_aitdtnn.png</image></root>
