The game features voice overs and writing done by the actual Simpsons cast and crew. The game does not feature every Simpson character, but most of the more popular characters are represented. The arcade cabinet is also very interesting because it features art that is made to simulate the grime of a bowling alley. The cabinet has ketchup stains and coffee stains, and art to look like discarded food and gum.    Gameplay  Plays like a standard arcade bowling titleThe game features multiple Simpson characters: Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, Mr Burns, Apu, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willies and Grandpa. Each of the characters has their own specific statistics, for example Homer is the all around bowler. Other characters from the Simpson's are represented, but not as playable characters. The game is controled using a track ball which is traditional for an arcade title. You are able to aim, angle, and curve the ball before throwing it. If the player gets a strike or spare on three frames in a row they earn a special ball. These special balls include a Maggie ball, nuclear ball and bomb ball, and they are meant to give the player an easy strike. After each frame the character will say a humorous one liner, and there is usually some visual gag included. After you complete a game of bowling each character features a specific ending, and the endings usually include long running gags from the series.      </description><genres><genre id="29">Bowling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12016">Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc.: Wreck Room Arcade - Bowling for Screams</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/68180/1529134-simpbowl.png</image></root>
