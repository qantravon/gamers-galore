<root><id>32874</id><name>Dinner Date</name><description>OverviewJulian Luxemburg is a young man who has arranged a dinner date with a 'beautiful girl' at his home. But the girl is late, and as the clock keeps ticking, Julian starts to worry; not only about whether his date will even show up or not, but also about various matters in his life that bother him. The unique twist of the game is that the player takes the role of Julian's subconscious, not only listening to his thoughts, but also triggering various actions and thoughts by doing random things like drinking wine, or merely looking at the clock. Through this the player learns more about Julian's life.The game was an IGF finalist at Independant Games Festival 2011.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7Processor: 1.6 GhzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: DirectXÂ® 9 compatible video cardHard Drive: 256 MBSound: OpenAL compatible sound card</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33629">Dear Esther</game><game id="37702">Thirty Flights of Loving</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/1744271-dinnerdate.jpg</image></root>
