Unfortunately, after the events from the first game,  the experience causes him to have a mental breakdown. In an attempt to regain his sanity, he returns to his childhood home town and moves in with his mother. A year goes by and Mike is still suffering from serious mental problems and memory lapses. Things go from bad to worse, his high school girlfriend, Rita, is found murdered after their high school reunion and everyone seems to believe that Mike is the one murdered her.  It would seem that the 'Ancients' have returned to get their vengeance. In order for Mike to clear his name, he must venture back through the different realities, solve    puzzles and stop the Ancients from taking over the world yet again.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4327">Roberta Williams' Phantasmagoria</game><game id="19359">Waxworks</game><game id="2695">I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</game><game id="2364">Clock Tower</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/721444-681.jpg</image></root>
