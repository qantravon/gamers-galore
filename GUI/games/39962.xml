The player controls Masamune Date, one of the most talented tacticians among the daimyos of the period.The game was released around the same time as the NES versions of Hot-B's Takeda Shingen and Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition - each features a different daimyo of the same era as their main protagonist.Namco sets Dokuganryu Masamune apart with a much more in-depth story to follow, as well as some real-time action battles that the player has some control over.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14028">Nobunaga's Ambition</game><game id="39959">Takeda Shingen</game><game id="40330">Hototogisu</game><game id="44032">Zan II: Spirits</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2340595-dokuganryu_masamune_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
