Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos was the third game in the    Sonic the Hedgehog series to be released for the    Sega Master System and    Game Gear. It was the first game on its platforms to allow the player to control    Tails, and the first game on any system in which the player could control Tails'  flight (although, unlike later games, it was not possible to carry Sonic, as the two characters were never in play at the same time). It was also the first game on the 8-bit platforms to feature the Spin Dash.    Chaos Emeralds were retrieved from special stages, a move that broke the precedence of the earlier 8-bit games, bringing things more in line with the 16-bit series. The content of these stages and the method of accessing them, however, was different: instead of receiving an extra life on collecting 100 rings, Sonic would be transported to a special area in which he would have to collect a further 100 rings within a time limit in order to be awarded one of the Chaos Emeralds.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33194">Coca-Cola Kid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1870237-box_sonicthc.png</image></root>
