The first two Super Famicom games in this series, SD Great Battle and Battle Dodgeball, were a platformer/brawler and a dodgeball game respectively. Battle Commander more closely resembles a 4X strategy game such as Famicom/Advance Wars or Military Madness. Players develop and build their side, recruit units, expand their territory and eliminate all opposition by destroying their base with overwhelming force.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2128261-battle_commander.jpg</image></root>
