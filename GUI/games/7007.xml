The game is unlike most racing games in that there are no tracks per say an endless highway to race on. The game features a semi-open world although there are no sidequest and the world is rather limited, still it was two years before GTA 3 and so it felt bigger than it was. During the game the main goal is to win races again a variety of gangs. To do this the player drives up to a gang member's car and then flashes their headlight's initiating a race. During races each car has a life bar, the life bar of each car deteriorates for every few seconds they fall behind, a race is completed once one of the opponents' life bars is totally depleted.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="225">Daytona USA</game><game id="14975">Import Tuner Challenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/460465-tokyo_highway_challenge_eu_box_art.jpg</image></root>
