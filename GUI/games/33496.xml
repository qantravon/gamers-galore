<root><id>33496</id><name>Strahl</name><description>Released a little over a decade after the initial popularity of Dragon's Lair, Strahl or Triad Stone as it's originally titled is what is now known as a Quick Time Event  game. The player watches a hero go on their adventure, rendered in hand-drawn anime style, in anticipation of a crucial moment that would lead to failure except for a swift, often directional, button press. In addition to directions the player is also occasionally tasked with mashing buttons to fill a meter in which some guy yells "Power! Power! Power!."As featured in the game's commercial shown in Japan, the hero runs away from giant logs and turn right at the right time and fight golems or something, and generally doing a lot of Dragon's Lair stuff like jumping from crumbling platform or grabbing onto a pyre floating down a lava river.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23">Dragon's Lair</game><game id="463">Space Ace</game><game id="33468">Lupin Sansei</game><game id="33471">Golgo 13: Carlyle no Yabou</game><game id="32217">Dragon's Lair Trilogy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1663029-strahl_box_front.jpg</image></root>
