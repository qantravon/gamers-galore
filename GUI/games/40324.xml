Each 7-Eleven store also has an in-game leaderboard to display the highest scoring players of the game there. The game was originally released under the misspelt title "Halo 4: King of the Hill Fuled by Mountain Dew" and has received a generally negative reaction from fans and press who have stated that it constitutes distasteful marketing.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2358648-untitled.png</image></root>
