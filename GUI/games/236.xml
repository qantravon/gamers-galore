The game had bosses who very closely resembled  Spider-Man,  Batman,  Godzilla   The Terminator. All Bosses were altered or replaced in later versions of the game: In version 1.01 Batman was replaced by a bat-like mutant, in 1.02 Spiderman is re-designed to look more like the character (because Sega was developing  The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for the Genesis at the time) also the bat creature is removed from the battle entirely, and in 1.03 Godzilla is replaced by a skeletal dinosaur. The copyright issues have been a major reason why the game is not often included in Sega compilation discs. The  Virtual Console version has a totally unique version where Spider-Man had a palette swap, but identical abilities (this is due to the license for using Spider-Man was for only limited time, that license is now owned by  Activision).SEGA AGESAs part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan (as it's Japanese title, The Super Shinobi). For the PlayStation 3, the title is released for Â¥600. For the Xbox 360, the title is released in a bundle with  Alex Kidd in Miracle World and  Super Hang-On for 800 MS Points.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14416">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</game><game id="13329">The Pirates of Dark Water</game><game id="11874">Ghostbusters</game><game id="12644">Ganryu</game><game id="34589">Super Ninja-kun</game><game id="40139">The Revenge of Shinobi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2412948-box_trosgen.png</image></root>
