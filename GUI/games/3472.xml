Released for the arcades, and later for the Sega Dreamcast. in 2000, Cannon Spike is a linear game, heavily focused towards boss encounters. A main feature of the game is the ability to play as a number of familiar Capcom characters from other franchises.GameplayThe player can use an 8-way direction stick, and four buttons in the arcades, or the thumbstick and face buttons of the Dreamcast controller. The player shoots the enemy with the characters standard weapon in any direction, and can lock on to individual enemies to strafe and more easily concentrate fire and avoid attacks. The player can also fire a more powerful charged shot, melée attack an enemy with a combo move, or melée attack an enemy with a more powerful single move that leaves the player more open to counter-attack. As is usual in top-down shooting games, there is also a "super move" that works as a "screen-clearer" or to take away large amounts of health from boss enemies. These are limited, and must be replendished by picking up power-ups throughout the level.CharactersCannon Spike features a number of pre-existing Capcom characters as playable avatars.Charlie (Nash)A first lieutenant  in the United States Air Force, Charlie (known as Nash in Japan), is a character from the Street Fighter Alpha fighting series.
