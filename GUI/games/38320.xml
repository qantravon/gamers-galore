In the game's opening, the player and other D-Class are sent into the chamber containing SCP-173, a grotesque statue capable of snapping people's necks while no one is looking directly at it. When the player approaches the SCP, the facility's power suddenly goes down, allowing the SCP to escape and kill everyone in the vicinity. Only the player survives, and must find a way out while avoiding SCP-173 and several other SCPs that have escaped confinement.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38693">Paranormal</game><game id="39825">Slender: The Arrival</game><game id="40089">Outlast</game><game id="30087">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/89057/2205003-scpcb.wordpress.jpeg</image></root>
