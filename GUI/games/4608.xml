<root><id>4608</id><name>World War III: Black Gold</name><description>StoryA secret United Nations think-tank researching world oil production has arrived at a shocking conclusion that the oil reserves have plunged to perilously low levels and within a few years all oil reserves will run out. Without the time required to switch to an alternative energy source for most of the developed world, the UN General Assembly called for all oil fields to be placed within their control to stop the total collapse of the world economy and stop the pandemonium and anarchy expected by such a crisis. With OPEC countries unwilling to hand over the oil supply the UN drafts a resolution to forcible capture all oil reserves in the world beginning with Middle East.

All three sides use tanks and helicopters as their main armament. Russians are good are manufacturing vehicles as well as have to most knowledge of using chemical weapons to kill enemies and capture their vehicles. The Iraqis get truck bombs and SCUD missile launchers for their ambush style attack but can also procure chemical weapons. The US gets long-range motors that can deliver air strikes from F-15's and B-2 bombers but can also stealth technology for ambush and sneak attacks.USAThe USA has fast production capacities as well as a large group of skilled scientist and engineers. This makes then quickly unlock new technologies. Good intelligence enables them to study future battle areas well in advance of the enemy. Logistics is a hindrance due to war taking place far away from home, this makes Americas was effort primarily a question of transport, supply and movement.RussiaRussia has a huge stockpile of military equipment such as vehicles and weaponry however some of it is outdated and not as modern as its enemies. The use of internationally banned weapons still plays a big part in their strategy. Old technologies have its advantages as itâ€™s inexpensive to produce and easily repairable making it very effective on the battlefield. Neglection of scientific research has lead to a slow development of new technologies.IraqIraqi military power is weak. It has a large army but suffers from shortages and generally has very little to no equipment. Foreign companies wanting to make huge monetary gains will break the arms embargo and supply an assortment of goods for the right price. With the greatest knowledge of the local terrain, locating oil reserves and exploiting them is an easy task. Furthermore its forced can perfectly camouflage into the landscape and deal kamikaze like blows and ambushes to the enemy.
