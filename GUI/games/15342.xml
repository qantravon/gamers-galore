Enhanced remakes were released for the Sega Saturn, PC-98 and Windows systems. It is the second in the Dragon Slayer series, preceded by Dragon Slayer and followed by Romancia, though, as most games in the Dragon Slayer series, have very little relation to each other beyond some key gameplay concepts.Xanadu is notable for several reasons, including its sales record for computer games in Japan with over 400,000 copies sold there in 1985 (later surpassed only by Thexder). It was also one of the foundations of the RPG genre, particularly the action RPG sub-genre, featuring real-time action combat combined with full-fledged RPG elements such as character statistics, innovative gameplay systems like the Karma meter and individual experience for equipped items, and platformer elements combined with the dungeon crawl gameplay of its predecessor. It also had towns to explore and introduced equipment that change the player character's visible appearance, food that is consumed slowly over time and essential for keeping the player character alive, and magic (in the form of projectiles) used to attack enemies from a distance. The following year saw the release of Xanadu Scenario II, an early example of an expansion pack.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7851">Faxanadu</game><game id="15158">Dragon Slayer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1033468-934895_78633_front.jpg</image></root>
