Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by a stake through the heart or exposure to sunlight. This does not suffice however, for they may be brought back to life by means of a secret rite that can be performed once a century when the moon is in the eighth house of Aquarius. The latest reincarnation did not run according to plan...StoryCount Duckula and his faithful servants Igor and Nannny have transported themselves and their castle over to the land of the Pharaohs, Egypt.  There they decide to search for mystical Sax, an ancient saxophone with strange magical powers.  They know that the Sax is hidden somewhere in the tomb of the great Pharaoh Upanatem, a gigantic pyramid in the middle of the desert.  What they don't know is that they've also brought along some unwanted guests in the shape of the Crow Brothers.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/823681-duckula_f.jpg</image></root>
