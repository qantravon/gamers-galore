Based upon the popular Mexican serial created by Roberto Bolaños, it is a modification of the Master System game Ghost House.All characters and items are changed to fit Chapolim's universe. Mick, the hero of Ghost House, is replaced by Chapolim. Armed with his trusty Marreta Biônica (Chipote Chillón in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English), dressed in red and wearing a yellow heart in his chest, he is a comedic character spoof of super heroes.The game play consists of platforming on stages in which Chapolim must defeat five vampires, each resting in a different coffin, locked by a key that can be found with exploration. Not only vampires stand in his way, but also mummies, bats, ghosts, man eating flowers and other horror movie clichés. Other than his mallet, Chapolim can jump over enemies and punch them. By jumping and punching the mansion's lights, Chapolim can freeze enemies in place in order to defeat them. Dracula himself shows up at the end of the game, serving as the last boss encounter.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2476246-hq.jpg</image></root>
