This device gets rid of pollution by transexisting it to another dimension that goes by the name of X Crement. Snotty Ragsdale (Boogerman) is an eccentric millionaire who takes a job at Stinkbaum's lab in order to see what is really happening to all the pollution. On this particular night Ragsdale disrupts the machine by sneezing on the crystal that makes the whole thing work. A large hand comes out of the machine and takes the crystal back to dimension X Crement. Ragsdale is left with only one option - He heads into the men's room and comes back out as Boogerman. Following the hand, he finds himself on a quest to save the world.Worlds/BossesWorld 1: Flatulent Swamps -- Boss: HickmanWorld 2: The Pits -- Boss: RevoltaWorld 3: Boogerville -- Boss: Fly BoyWorld 4: Mucous Mountains and Nasal Caverns -- Boss: Deodor AntWorld 5: Pus Palace -- Boss: Boogermeister</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11133">Earthworm Jim</game><game id="19944">Disney's Aladdin</game><game id="36054">Gesundheit!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2369756-genesis_boogerman_eu_cropped.jpg</image></root>
