The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom. It was followed up the subsequent year with Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, a Puyo-Puyo style puzzle game that was the basis for Namco's later Pac-Attack.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9493">Fantasy Zone</game><game id="21861">Twinbee</game><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="18690">Galaga 3</game><game id="15784">Galaga</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/122201/1682669-570867_8491_front.jpg</image></root>
