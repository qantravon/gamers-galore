The title retained its trademark feature of "chance shot" which at times would enable the player to enter a first person mode and aim a reticule at the goal indicating where the player wanted to aim their shot. The number of teams were increased to 48 and split into 6 groups. The main gameplay mode is a World cup tournament mode in which you get grouped with 4 other countries and progress in a round robin format to the quarter finals - semi finals and finally the world cup final Teams Europe A - England, Spain, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, IrelandEurope B - France, Germany, Bulgaria, Sweden, Russia, Belgium, Greece, RomaniaAisia - South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, China, Iran, Hong Kong, UAEAmericas - USA, Mexico, Canada, Australia, NZ,Costa Rica, El Salvidor, Honduras.South America - Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, EcuadorAfrica - Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Zambia, Guinea  </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37101">Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3106/661458-ssideki22.png</image></root>
