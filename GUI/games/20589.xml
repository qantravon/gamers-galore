This is the first Bomberman game and unfortunately it didn't contain any multiplayer. At the time it was still a very good game and today it is considered as a genre-defining video game. Nowadays there are countless versions of it and huge communities around them.StoryBomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.Other VersionsThe Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3050">Silent Bomber</game><game id="1352">RoboWarrior</game><game id="21069">Rollinâ€™ Rascals</game><game id="14710">Wrecking Crew</game><game id="22768">Spark World</game><game id="18007">Spiritual Warfare</game><game id="7190">Super Bomberman 3</game><game id="11353">Arkista's Ring</game><game id="8997">Banana</game><game id="8802">Binary Land</game><game id="6040">Chack'n Pop</game><game id="5057">Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</game><game id="1601">Lumines II</game><game id="15520">Bomb'X</game><game id="24097">Tenchu: Shadow Assault</game><game id="25118">Dynabusters</game><game id="38300">Dynamite Jack</game><game id="14354">Pirate Ship Higemaru</game><game id="39251">Higemaru Makaijima</game><game id="40135">Radical Bomber!!
