<root><id>19939</id><name>Cyber Knight</name><description>OverviewCyber Knight is a sci-fi RPG that uses mechs and interstellar travel to tell its story about a ship with a minimal crew that barely survives a scrape with space pirates and must find their way back to civilization. Its combat is grid-based, with allied units moving around and attacking enemies, adding a strategic element to its traditional RPG gameplay. It was originally released on the PC Engine (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in the US) and subsequently on the Super Famicom a couple of years later.The game was never officially localized for the west, though a fan translation from Aeon Genesis exists. The game also has a sequel, Cyber Knight II: Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou, which similarly received a fan translation from Aeon Genesis.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19127">Hoshi wo Miru Hito</game><game id="18304">Xenogears</game><game id="9032">Star Ocean</game><game id="394">Robotrek</game><game id="7400">Phantasy Star</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2419888-b1.png</image></root>
