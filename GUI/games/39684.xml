It's the sequel to 2011's PSN-exclusive Red Johnson's Chronicles. At release, it costs $10 on PSN and 800 MSP on XBLA.PlotThe game is set in the same alternate-Soviet city of Metropolis as the original. You play as Red Johnson, a private investigator who, after the events of the previous game, has now gained some amount of fame--which proves costly. Red's brother has abducted, and Red must use his puzzle-solving private investigator skills to track him down and rescue him.GameplayMuch like the previous episode, Red Johnson's Chronicles: One Against All is a point-and-click adventure and puzzle game. You navigate around the environment, look for clues, investigate witnesses, and solve puzzles. The game has no shortage of quick time events. The puzzles range from word logic puzzles, to solving equations to learn keypad codes, to working out Sudoku puzzles on broken cash registers. The player chooses the difficulty with puzzles; an in-game currency system allows you to buy hints when you can't solve something.The game boasts a dark-humoured, innuendo-filled writing style, and the game's creators estimate six to eight hours of gameplay.ReceptionAt present, only one review of the game has made Metacritic, a negative review (with a 4.0 score) in the Official Xbox Magazine. The reviewer, Cameron Lewis, calls it "awkward and nonsensical," "drudgery," and suggests you're "better off just buying a puzzle magazine at the airport."</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11865">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2314074-box_rjc.png</image></root>
