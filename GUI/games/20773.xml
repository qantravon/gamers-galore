The XBLA version was done by Slick Entertainment (with assistance from Klei Entertainment), and published by Metanet; the DS and PSP versions were handled by SilverBirch Studios and published by Atari SA. In N+, the player controls a stick figure ninja that must reach a doorway within a certain amount of time with acrobatics such as wall jumping. Many different enemies and obstacles scatter the levels, making many levels a labyrinth.Single PlayerDeath, something you will experience a lot while playing N+This mode is composed of 50 episodes you must beat within a time limit that can be increased by picking up gold. Although the single player is rather linear, you can start up at any time from various episodes in intervals of five. Each episode has 5 levels starting at 0 and going up to 4. To complete a level, you must pass through a door which may have to be activated by a switch while avoiding obstacles that can instantly kill you such as mines that explode on impact, homing rocket launchers, and blue robot-fish that go in a set path that will electrocute you if touched. The game is known for its high difficulty level and it can be very frustrating.EpisodesN+ comes with over 300 levels and the ease of use found in the level creator encourages user submitted content.There are extra levels available though DLC on the Xbox Live Marketplace.Multiplayer ModesN+ Multiplayer supports of up to four players each from different consoles.Race ModeA mode in which the host picks a single player episode and all participants have to reach the end with the most time remaining.Survival ModeA mode in which players are put into a survival episode, which has a lot of turrets etc. trying to kill them.
