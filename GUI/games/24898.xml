Most of the crew and passengers are then infected by a plague which turns them into zombies.GameplayThe player will choose one of four classes, increasing replay value by providing different experiences with each class. The campaign will also be playable in 4-player co-op, each of the players using a different class. The ship, which is approximately a mile long, will be almost fully destructible, with said destruction being persistent. The game also uses the underwater setting in this - if you blow open a window, water will slowly flood that section of the ship, flushing away enemies and Â possibly allowing you to swim to previously inaccessible areas.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17280">BioShock</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10460/841896-under_pressure.jpg</image></root>
