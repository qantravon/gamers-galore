All you need is a Remote and a decent throwing arm and some party friends. The Wi-Fi and Multiplayer modes are some of the most extensive to be found on any Wii title. CONTROLS: Aim with the pointer and make a throwing action, release the (A) button during the throw to let bananas fly, swerve the flight with the Direction Pad. Catch incoming Bananas with the (A) button, dodge incoming bananas with the Direction Pad, leap to another platform with the (B) button and shake the controller to conjure up a Banana tree for more ammo. You can also use the balance board to dodge incoming weapons.
