In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40724">Devilman</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1687731-kidou_keisatsu_patlabor_dai_2_shoutai_shutsudou_seyo__box_front.jpg</image></root>
