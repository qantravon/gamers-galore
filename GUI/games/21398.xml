<root><id>21398</id><name>Chaos Wars</name><description>OverviewChaos Wars is a PS2 crossover RPG from Idea Factory that features characters from Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, Spectral Souls, and Gungrave. Released in North America by the small publisher O~3 Entertainment, the game is perhaps more known in the west for its low-budget English dub, which was scraped together in order to meet requirements for certification through Sony Computer Entertainment America. SCEA's standard policy requires that games that utilize voice acting must include an English dub if the game is released on physical media.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13073">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</game><game id="7259">Arc the Lad</game><game id="3731">Phantom Brave</game><game id="3960">Shadow Hearts</game><game id="24212">Growlanser</game><game id="5580">Spectral Souls: Resurrection of the Ethereal Empires</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2525164-box_cwars.png</image></root>
