Individually, the game's toughest regular enemy was a marauding Mandlebrot Set.GameplayLlamatron allowed for simultaneous two-player, which could either be co-operative or competitive for score.Control could either be with two joysticks, for traditional twin-stick, or with one joystick. In this option holding fire locked the direction of fire to the current direction, allowing the player to move in one direction, while shooting in another.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11233">Robotron: 2084</game><game id="4010">Berzerk</game><game id="2718">Ancipital</game><game id="34137">Minotron: 2112</game><game id="39485">The Border Lands</game><game id="39804">Microbes</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1099/1629556-llamatron1.png</image></root>
