<root><id>6077</id><name>Crisis Zone</name><description>Crisis Zone is a single-player, first person  rail shooter, released in 1999 to arcades and  ported to the Playstation 2 in 2004. The game uses a pedal cover mechanic similar to that found in  Time Crisis. A player is in cover, and invulnerable until the pedal is pressed, at which point a player can fire the main weapon. Reloading that weapon requires returning to cover momentarily. There is a time limit to each stage that is reset with the completion of each section within a stage. The player is given three health blocks, only hits from those with warning indicators do damage. Each of these hits results in the loss of a health block. Unlike Time Crisis or its sequel, Crisis Zone features a fully automatic  sub machine gun that holds 40 rounds.  The original arcade release had three stages, each with it's own  boss battle. These could be finished in any order, the completion of which sees the player enter the final stage of the game.   StagesDrycreek Plaza Garland Park Garland Technology Centre     Geyser 1 (final stage)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18347">Killer7</game><game id="19571">T2: The Arcade Game</game><game id="19246">Vampire Night</game><game id="10543">Virtua Cop</game><game id="9341">Virtua Cop 2</game><game id="20460">Target: Terror</game><game id="508">The House of the Dead</game><game id="422">The House of the Dead 2</game><game id="7703">The House of the Dead III</game><game id="21838">The House of the Dead 4</game><game id="21276">CarnEvil</game><game id="25072">Let's Go Jungle!: Lost on the Island of Spice</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1832169-box_tccz.png</image></root>
