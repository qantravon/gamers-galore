You can create alliances with other up-coming empires and trade items, along with fighting them for their territory and capturing their soldiers, opening the possibility of hiring them as Generals or Lieutenants, or just setting them free.CampaignGuan Yu Taking over an Enemy baseYou start off the game by selecting if you want a pre-made team, (like Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan and Cao Cao or Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei), or if you would like to make your own. After selecting your team, you pick your starting land and from then on, you battle with other empires for that land and the resources that land has, like Gold and Items. After each turn, your officers will propose offers, such as restoring 1000 troops to each officer or fire arrows, replacing your archersâ€™ normal arrows with more damaging fire arrows. Other land rulers can attack your lands and you will be given the option to either defend or attack, although a failure to defend successfully (or at all) will result in the targeted land being lost, along with the gold and items received from it.CharactersThese are the Characters that Are in DW4: Empires.(Characters are in alphabetical order)Cao CaoCao RenDa QiaoDian WeiDiao ChanDong ZhouGan NingGuan YuHuang GaiHuang ZhongJiang WeiLiu BeiLu BuLu MengLu XunMa ChaoPang TongSima YiSun CeSun JianSun ShangxiangSun QuanTaishi CiWei YanXiahou DunXiahou YuanXiao QiaoXu HuangXu ZhuYuan ShaoYue YingZhang FeiZhang HeZhang JiaoZhang LiaoZhao YunZhen JiZhou TaiZhou YuZhu RongZhuge Liang Character CustomizationCharacter CustomizationYou can create your own general with a weapon from anyone of the characters in the game, Make up there name, the way they look, there voice and there movement and there special skill likeAmbush, were that general can call an ambush on some enemy soldiers in a battle at any time.Proposal OffersThese are broken down into seven different categories.Product DevolpmentCommerce- Cost: NonePromote a regions industry, acquire 300 gold.Restructure- Cost: 1500~Cancel current production, and begin production of a new product.Expand- Cost: 2000Begin production of a new product in addition to the production of current productions.Accelerate- Cost: 1000Shorten production time by 2 turns.Refine- Cost: 850~Raise the level of a product.Perfect- Cost: 2500Substantially raise the level of a product.Mass produce- Cost: 1000Speed up the production of an entire regions products so that those products can be used in the next battle.Officer AffairsTutor - Cost: 3000Raise the level of one of your officers.Local Search -Cost: 1700~Search your area for free officers.Wide search- Cost: 2200~Search the entire country for free officers.Recruit - Cost: 2000Recruit talent and choose an officer to employ.Bribe - Cost: 3200~Present a product to another force in order to convince an officer to join you.
