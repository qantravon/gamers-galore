The island was divided into twelve region, one for each Tribe. Some tribes differed in colour, but all were controlled in the same way. Some abilities were specific to certain tribes, while others were reused several times.The land of each tribe had its own visial style and music, and some unique challenges.GameplayLand of the LemmingsThe game featured 120 levels split equally between the 12 tribes. When the 10 levels of each tribe were completed, a segment of a talisman was awarded. When all 12 pieces of talisman were united, the island of the lemmings was saved.Over 50 types of lemming featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.Each Tribe started with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level, and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived would proceed to the next level, which could lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze would be awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.Gameplay additions not related to the lemmings themselves were hazards and challenges specifc to each environment, and the interface featured an additional 'fan' icon, which allowed drifting lemmings to be blown along.Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.LevelsThe Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker*returning from the original Lemmings.
