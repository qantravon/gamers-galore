Each game does appear to get progressively harder the more you play. For example the keepy uppies game is mayhem from about the fourth play onwards. Race games likewise add more laps and speedups/slowdowns the more times you replay.   GRAPHICS:All the sporting events and characters are presented in full 3D of a high standard and level of detail with good framerate.  FINAL THOUGHTS:Obviously released to coincide with the Cartoon Networks scheduled showing of Capser's Scare School cartoons. This game provides excellent fun for the holidays and appeals to both adults and children alike.    </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/68568/1194101-000_dsboxuk.jpg</image></root>
