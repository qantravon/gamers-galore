It is a spinoff of the Puyo Puyo series, which itself uses characters from Madou Monogatari. The game has many elements typical of roguelikes, including turn-based movement. Players take control of either Arle Nadja (with Carbuncle), Rulue (with Minotauros), or Schezo Wegey and battle their way through several element-themed dungeons headed by recurring Madou Monogatari enemies such as Draco Centauros, Suketoudara, and Witch.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9261/306762-wakuwakupuyo_f.jpg</image></root>
