Essentially a revamped version of Manchester United game with an improved pitch and slightly better graphics,  John Barnes looks like a cynical marketing ploy to relieve you of a bit more of your hard-earned money in the name of football.  The action is limited and is very much a case of kick and run football. The standard tactic is to hoof the ball as soon as you get it, and hope that at some point it ends up in the net.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5626">Kick Off 2</game><game id="6112">Kick Off</game><game id="27453">Sensible Soccer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/294680-john_barnes_european_football_cover.jpg</image></root>
