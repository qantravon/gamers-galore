<root><id>27071</id><name>Star Defense</name><description>OverviewStar Defense was released in 2009 by ngmoco after being jointly  developed by ngmoco and Rough Cookie. The game innovates on the standard  tower defense formula by creating small spherical (and sometimes  cubical) worlds in space that require defense. These planets have set  paths that enemies follow, but really change up standard twoer defense  gameplay by having the path wind around the entire surface of the  planet.    Gameplay           The game is very similar to most tower defense games and involves waves  of enemies that must be destroyed by towers which can be placed  strategically along a path that the spawned enemies will follow to their  goal which is the player's base that is protected by a shield wall.  Towers can be upgraded up to three times to increase their range, damage  output and general capacity. Waves are timed, but can be launched ahead  of schedule by tapping on the screen. The entire world is rotated by  swiping across the screen while two fingers can be used to spin the view  of the world in different directions and to zoom in and out on the  playing field.    Tower Types   NameEffect  Gauss Cannon ($25)  Standard bullet damage  Neo-Plasma Blaster ($60)  Persistent fire damage  DX-3 Cannon ($75)  Slow effect  Phase Coil   Electrical damage field  Quantum Launcher  Stronger bullet damage  </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12764">PixelJunk Monsters</game><game id="22139">Desktop Tower Defense</game><game id="22801">Ninjatown</game><game id="27091">geoDefense</game><game id="30591">Colony Defense</game><game id="36457">Unstoppable Gorg</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2649/1059171-stardef1.jpg</image></root>
