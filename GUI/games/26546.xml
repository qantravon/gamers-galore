<root><id>26546</id><name>Zoombinis: Island Odyssey</name><description>SummaryThis is the first Zoombinis game to incorporate science in the puzzles, which include intersection of rates, decoding, astronomical time, Venn diagrams, and Punnett squares, as well as some reincarnations of puzzles from Logical Journey. The graphics have again changed, and the Zoombinis' features are no longer important to gameplay. Here, they are fully 3-D. The Zoombinis must complete different puzzles, such as growing berries and breeding butterflies and must take care of the Zerbles, feed them, and then release them into the wild. Once the Zoombinis get all of the 224 Zerbles into the wild, the Zoombinis head back to Zoombiniville, and the game is complete.
