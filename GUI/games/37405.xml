To fire, you can use up to two fingers to direct your weapons fire. Swiping upwards on the screen with three fingers activates "Overdrive" which clears the screen of all enemies. The round ends when all of your defenses are destroyed. Consecutively killing the same type of enemy will increase your score multiplier. Based on your score at the end of each round you are rewarded with points which lets you upgrade your weapons.Gameplay Modes:ArcadeEnemies attack your base in waves of increasing difficulty.
