Â The game has two modes of play: TEN FLOORS, in which you play through 10 short floors in an effort to achieve the best score, and TOWER, in which you see how high you can climb before dying.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29343">Tinker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/112/896657-dsi019.jpg</image></root>
