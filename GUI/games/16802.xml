<root><id>16802</id><name>Space Crusade</name><description>OverviewSpace Crusade is a sci-fi strategy game based on the board game made by Milton Bradly that shares the same name. The game also shares similar mechanics to those found in Hero Quest. You play as the commander and four space marines. Each level has a story and a set of mission objectives that you have to solve. Usually it tells you to either kill off the aliens or destroy the enemy mothership. As in Gremlin's earlier game Hero Quest, Space Crusade also uses a turn-based system, and the number of points you get from round to round determines your movement and action points. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9695">Hero Quest</game><game id="31202">Alien Assault</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/826/608973-466px_space_crusade.jpg</image></root>
