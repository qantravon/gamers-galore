<root><id>20288</id><name>Stellar Track</name><description>Stellar Track was a conversion of a college mainframe Star Trek game released by Sears in 1981. It is a suitably primitive game where you have to run scans to locate enemies and starbases on a 6 x 6 galactic map. You run scans to find the enemies then must warp to their quadrant to confront them with either phasers or photon torpedoes. You use the joystick to determine the numerals of where you intend you to travel to. Â The controls are fairly difficult to master and the game tends to be rather difficult to play unless one has the instruction manual.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5278/366906-stellar.jpg</image></root>
