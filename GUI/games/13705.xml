<root><id>13705</id><name>Sonic Advance 3</name><description>GameplaySonic Advance 3 maintains the fast paced, side scrolling gameplay from previous entries in the Sonic Advance franchise.  The game borrows mechanics introduced in      Sonic Advance 2 such as the aerial trick system and faster moving characters.  New to this entry in the series is the ability to select a team of two characters rather than just one.  The first character selected is player controlled, while the second allows the player to activate a specific "tag ability" upon holding and releasing the R button.  Although there are five characters to choose from, leading to twenty possible permutations, each combination is classified into one of three categories: Speed, Flight, and Power.  This category is determined by the focus of each team's abilities.  The levels are specifically designed to have branching routes that cater to each category of team.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9441">Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!</game><game id="20748">Super Mario Bros. 3: Super Mario Advance 4</game><game id="21622">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Veediots!</game><game id="1683">Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2098013-box_sonica3.png</image></root>
