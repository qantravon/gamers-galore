It is set in the lands described in the Book of Mormon, which, depending on your personal beliefs, would either make this historical fiction, or alternate historical fiction. Much in the same vein as Left Behind: Eternal Forces, or Super Noah's Ark 3D, this is a religiously-centered game, with many of the themes coming from the stories of the LDS faith.In the game, you play as Helam, a stripling warrior (stripling meaning "youth", and deriving from a BoM story about an army of youths).</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
