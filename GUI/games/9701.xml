The game was the topic of much controversy due to its violent mature nature and its depiction of violence and its links to the sport of football (soccer). GameplayYour primary units are your gang leader along with units he has recruited with money. Secondary non-controllable units may be recruited through means of buying alcohol for the public at a bar that supports your team. The game progresses in a mission based structure each with unique goals. The primary resource in the game is money which you gain primarily from looting shops. Opposing units come from both enemy teams and the riot squad.Â  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12100">Gangland</game><game id="12502">Gangsters</game><game id="306">Gangsters 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1379/922829-hooligans___storm_over_europe_coverart.png</image></root>
