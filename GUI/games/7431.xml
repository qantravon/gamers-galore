The game features three main game modes: Career, Quick Race and Head to Head. In Career Mode you purchase a vehicle and start climbing the charts by winning races and earning money, which you can use to upgrade your vehicle or buy a new one. This is the main mode of the game, which allows you to unlock all the hidden cars it has. In Quick Race, you just set up a race in any track with any of the vehicles you´ve unlocked and race for fun. Finally, Head to Head is a multiplayer mode that allows you to race a friend.Key FeaturesWell developed physics engine that makes each car and truck feel how it is supposed to. Almost the whole Ford lineup is represented in the game, from the entry level Ka to the Mustang GT and GT90. SUV´s and pickups, like the Explorer and F-150 are included as well. Race twelve other cars at the same time. Best-suited for a Ford enthusiast. Simple car-upgrade system based on acquiring parts rather than on performance tuning. Low price tag of $9.99.  CriticsGame critics agreed that the game suffered from bad graphics, a very bad AI that is limited to following a preset racing line and pretty standard music. Some critics also stated that having only Ford vehicles didn't justify to make a full game. However, they praised its physics engine and the way each car was modeled after its real world counterpart. Its budget price tag was also noticed.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="20741">Need for Speed: Undercover</game><game id="9651">Need for Speed Underground 2</game><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="8831">Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</game><game id="12395">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</game><game id="453">Need for Speed: High Stakes</game><game id="18021">Need for Speed: Carbon - Own the City</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="531">TOCA Race Driver 2</game><game id="5869">TOCA Touring Car Championship</game><game id="13734">TOCA Race Driver 3</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="17784">Gran Turismo 4</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="8100">Gran Turismo 2</game><game id="21297">Gran Turismo HD</game><game id="7482">Gran Turismo Concept: 2001 Tokyo</game><game id="21390">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Seoul</game><game id="7313">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Geneva</game><game id="13895">Gran Turismo 4: Prologue</game><game id="1101">Ridge Racer 7</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="11625">Ridge Racer DS</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="6499">RalliSport Challenge 2</game><game id="8779">Sega GT 2002</game><game id="14428">Sega GT Online</game><game id="15965">Sega GT</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="357">Burnout 3: Takedown</game><game id="4970">Burnout Legends</game><game id="13514">Burnout 2: Point of Impact</game><game id="8459">Burnout Dominator</game><game id="10149">Burnout: Championship Drag Racing</game><game id="20858">NASCAR 09</game><game id="11055">NASCAR 08</game><game id="5856">NASCAR Racing 2003 Season</game><game id="20038">NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona</game><game id="18428">NASCAR Thunder 2004</game><game id="8438">NASCAR 06: Total Team Control</game><game id="21724">NASCAR Racing 2002 Season</game><game id="788">The Fast and the Furious</game><game id="9927">SRS: Street Racing Syndicate</game><game id="21307">Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="17599">Forza Motorsport</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="8621">Hummer: Badlands</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1506/694924-437534_50728_front.jpg</image></root>
