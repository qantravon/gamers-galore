While wiring up rooms, the electrician must be wary of various vermin inside the walls as well as burglars that will occasionally emerge from a newly-lit room.The game has an adjustable difficulty setting (actually the speed at which enemies move) and an "overworld", in which the electrician must move from one building to the next.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2247579-electrician_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
