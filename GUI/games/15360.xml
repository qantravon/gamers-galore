No laser cannons or over sized melee weapons. Just you, the woods, the animal and your rifle. Customize your own personal weapon that suits you the best. Explore the environment on horse back or while driving your Quad. You're also able to test your skills in the multiplayer mode!Deer Hunter 2005 was never released in Europe. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22676">Deer Hunter Tournament</game><game id="23865">Cabela's Legendary Adventures</game><game id="10598">Cabela's Deer Hunt: 2005 Season</game><game id="25540">Hunting Unlimited 4</game><game id="8823">Hunting Unlimited 3</game><game id="25630">The Hunter</game><game id="2990">Primal Prey</game><game id="29588">Remington Great American Bird Hunt</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33486/1094582-deer_hunter.jpg</image></root>
