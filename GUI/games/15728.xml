It is the seventh installment of the                   King of Fighters series and is the final King of Fighters game by the original SNK before the company became financially bankrupt. The story continues from                  The King of Fighters '99, as commander                 Heidern uses the King of Fighters tournament (with the aid of his friend, Ling, who has his own secret agenda) to lure protagonists                K' and               Maxima out so they could be interrogated into telling the whereabouts of the evil NESTS syndicate.  The Hero team from the previous installment was split into two teams: the Hero team and the Benimaru team, each including new characters, such as the mercenary              Vanessa, the Mexican wrestler             Ramon, the agent            Seth, and the assassin           Lin.          Blue Mary and         King from the Women Fighters team are swapped with        Mai Shiranui and       Yuri Sakazaki of the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting team.      Li Xiangfei from the Women Fighters team was replaced by the new     Hinako Shijo.    Kyo Kusanagi and   Iori Yagami are playable with no team association, with Kyo's clones absent. A new character and sub-boss,  Kula Diamond (the "Anti-K'"), debuts in this installment.  The game also features unique alternate Strikers based on characters from either earlier installments of the King of Fighters series, from other SNK franchises, or completely new conceptual versions of characters.
