The game depicts the adventures of the titular hero as he (or she, as the player is able to choose the character's gender) journeys across the world to rescue a princess.It is unusually deep for a game of this period, presenting many opportunities to purchase a diverse range of items to assist in combat and exploration, with various side-tunnels and dungeons to explore on the way to the goal. It also has a unique feature of allowing the player to use an item in each hand with their uses occasionally changing depending on which hand each item is in.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2294839-woody_poco_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
