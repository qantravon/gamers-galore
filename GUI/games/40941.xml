<root><id>40941</id><name>Lode Runner: Lost Labyrinth</name><description>Though considered a very basic game when compared to other TurboGrafx-16 releases, Lode Runner: Lost Labyrinth contains the same featureset as the original computer versions of the game, including the ability to create and save user-created levels. Like other console releases, the action takes place on a scrolling screen, rather than a fixed single screen. The graphics have also been created specifically for this version, making the enemies look more deliberately like robots and the player character appears to be some sort of suited-up super human.A password system exists alongside a proper backup option for saving single-player progress.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2399927-loderunner_pce.jpeg</image></root>
