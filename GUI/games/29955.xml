It is one of Cat Daddy's earliest works and is the first of three games in the "Skateboard Park Tycoon" series. This company has developed an unhealthy amount of cash-in "tycoon" games. They have also done some work on some quality games too though, such as Flight Simulator 2001 and Need For Speed: High Stakes.</description><genres><genre id="23">Skateboarding</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17948">Mall Tycoon</game><game id="10364">Prison Tycoon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2422356-skate_board_park_tycoon_cover.jpg</image></root>
