First person view is also offered to "enhance" realism.Game ModesThere are three different game modes that will be available from start.Story Mode (Single Player) Speed Catch (Single Player) Nine Trial / Bomber Catch (Multiplayer)  Story ModeIn story mode, the player will be playing catch with    NPCs.  The NPCs will increase in difficulty as you play and a conversation mechanic will also somehow be implemented into the gameplay.  Many different stories will be hidden in these conversations that will somehow lead to saving the earth through playing catch.Speed CatchThis mode is basically the    survival mode of the game.  As you catch the NPC's throws, the throw will become faster and faster.  Once the player has missed 3 catches, the game is over.  It has not been said whether these scores will be saved online, offline or at all.Nine Trial / Bomber CatchThe multiplayer portion can be played with up to 4 players.  Nine Trial tasks the player with breaking 9 plates.  Whichever player breaks all 9 the fastest wins.  Bomber Catch is similiar to hot potato.  The players will toss the bomb around to different players.  The first person who misses a catch loses.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/495/1126864-20081002letscatch.jpg</image></root>
