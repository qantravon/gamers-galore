<root><id>35771</id><name>32 in 1 Game Cartridge</name><description>The 2600 version's rather sketchy box art, being of dubious quality for a professional release, as well as the appearance of characters that did not appear within the cartridge (Mario, Luigi, what appears to be a green Pac-Man), is often assumed to be a fake.The 7800 version is just the 2600 version but relabeled. Due to the 7800's backwards compatibility, though, it was still playable on the 7800.Most of the games are previous releases for the 2600, while others are renamed and/or sprite edits.GameNotesUFORetitled Space JockeyFun with NumbersFlag CaptureGolfCheckersFreeway RabbitHacked version of Freeway to include a rabbit as the player characterNFL FootballRetitled FootballFishingHacked version of Fishing Derby.
