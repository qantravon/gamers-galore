It tells the story of a group of people who wake up one day to find themselves in a town that is seemingly made up of different worlds and ages. After arriving in this town one day a boy by the name of Sword decides to see who is behind this nefarious plan and to try and stop him.The basic game is a dungeon crawler where each dungeon is randomly generated. The game received some criticism for some of it's rather unique gameplay designs. Namely these were the fact that only one main character at a time could venture in a dungeon. and that each time you entered a dungeon your experience level reset back to one.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5846">Azure Dreams</game><game id="20911">Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon</game><game id="6965">LandStalker: The Treasures of King Nole</game><game id="24307">Steal Princess</game><game id="4202">Evolution: The World of Sacred Device</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17929/637242-timestalkersca.png</image></root>
