<root><id>15426</id><name>The Sims: Life Stories</name><description>This game differs from "The Sims" and "The SIms 2" because the game has a directed story mode, you must meet targets set in order to further the gameplay. After the two story modes are completed, you are then free to do whatever you like. The Sims Life Stories is basically a cheaper alternative to buying The Sims 2, seeing as it's almost exactly the same with the exception of having to endure being told what to do for an hour or two. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17463">The Sims</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/176/195721-937309_82922_front.jpg</image></root>
