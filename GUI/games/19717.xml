Drol could shoot, had a   jet pack, and could transition up and down the levels of the world through trap doors. Enemies include snakes, monsters, axes, and the dreaded robot eating plant. The children the robot had to rescue were chasing balloons, which could make them more difficult to catch. Similar to     Defender, Drol featured a mini-map at the top of the screen to see approaching enemies and locate the robot's rescue targets. Originally released on the        Commodore 64, Drol was later ported to the       Apple II and      Atari 400/800. Drol was published by  Broderbund in 1983 and retailed for $34.95.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4511/1154094-300px_drol__broderbund___disk__front_cover.jpg</image></root>
