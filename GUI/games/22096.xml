The player was allowed to select a club and initiate a swing. The swing showed a gauge at the bottom of the screen which had to be charged up for the desired power and then subsequently stopped in a narrow area otherwise the ball would curve to the left or the right. Wind direction also affected the flight of the ball. Putting showed the slop of the green and allowed the player to aim with an arrow to compensate for slope. Putting strokes were performed similar to other strokes but only the putter was allowed once on the green. The game does not simulate different cuts of grass or rough, a ball is either on the fairway, in a bunker, on the green, out of bounds, or in the water. If a ball lands out of bounds or in the water the player has to retry the stroke and also takes a penalty stroke. All game modes are played on a single course.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19044">Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf</game><game id="8885">NES Open Tournament Golf</game><game id="21837">Bandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach</game><game id="12570">World Golf</game><game id="35133">Golf: Japan Course</game><game id="25353">Golf Grand Slam</game><game id="24167">Golf</game><game id="39786">Golf Club: Birdie Rush</game><game id="37328">Namco Classic</game><game id="40760">Winning Shot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361763-nes_golf.jpg</image></root>
