The release of The Harbor marks the first game released by Ubisoft on the app store that was not a port of another game (   see Assassin's Creed  II: Discovery ), or simply a published game that was developed by a different studio.  GameplayThe Harbor puts you in the shoes of a harbor master in the birthing days of America and many other geographical/cultural discoveries. Your job is to manage trading and placement of incoming ships bringing and buy goods to the cities. In standard time management style, you have only a certain amount of time to make enough money to complete each level. You accomplish this by trading as many goods with as many ships as possible.  Different ships carry different unique styles, such as larger ships which provide more goods, but cost more, or small ships that frequent the harbor more, but are less patient in waiting to be loaded. There is a variety of goods, and the kind varies based on where you harbor is located. As you progress through the game, you will take control of new harbors, some which require repairs and maintenance, or that are frequented by more difficult traders.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15284/1335533-0221.png</image></root>
