It was released as an update to the 2000 Playstation game Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. This edition comes with more riders, more music, modes, and levels. The level count is increased from 12 to 20. A new difficulty mode was added called Expert Mode, which makes the game much tougher and implements the most advanced tricks in the game. Another perk of the new version is a soundtrack disc of all the new songs on the soundtrack.Riders          Dave Mirra         Ryan Nyquist        Joey Garcia       Kenan Harkin      Leigh Ramsdell     Chad Kagy    Mike Laird   Troy McMurrayTim Mirra  Shaun ButlerHidden Riders Amish BoySlim JimSoundtrack59 Times the Pain - Got It All in SightCypress Hill - DustDeftones - Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)Dropkick Murphys - Never AlonePennywise - GreedPrimer 55 - LooseRancid - Maxwell MurderSnapcase - Energy DomeSocial Distortion - Don't Drag Me DownSublime - What I GotSwingin' Utters - Stupid Lullabies98 Mute - Hit You BackMillencolin - Devil MeDeath By Stereo - You Can Lead a Man to Reason, But You Can't Make Him ThinkVision - Close MindedDeviates - Right Back to YouMillencolin - Twenty TwoVision - Don't Sound the AlarmMillencolin - Penguins and Polar Bears</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2341">Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</game><game id="3238">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3</game><game id="5474">BMX XXX</game><game id="5688">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</game><game id="21793">Downhill Domination</game><game id="25743">Sunny Garcia Surfing</game><game id="27632">MTV Sports: T.J.
