(natto is a regional Japanese dish) and a chef-like spy determined to stop them. Several allusions to the 007 franchise are made throughout the game, including an opening cutscene viewed from the barrel of a gun and the hero casually tossing his hat onto a hat rack as the game begins.Besides the odd narrative elements, it plays much like any Portopia-derived adventure game: The player can interact with their environment through a list of commands on the right side of the screen and the goal is to talk to NPCs, explore the surroundings and discover clues in order to solve a mystery.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21300">James Bond 007</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="4555">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</game><game id="40535">Pro Yakyuu?
