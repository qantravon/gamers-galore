The game was released on April 1, 2007, and was developed entirely by Paul Allen Panks. The game is a short text adventure, tasking the player character with the destruction of an evil vampire. Vampyre Cross is an unofficial sequel to the 1986 game Vampyre Hunter.  Intense wolf fighting simulation.     The game was almost universally panned by judges and players, due to its requirement to insert the opposing side of the disk every time an object is examined. It was eventually disqualified from the competition due to the fact that it had been previously released.  As a simple text adventure, Vampyre Cross is similar in structure and style to other games from the 1980s. Commands are entered (typically in the form of "VERB NOUN"), triggering responses from the environment, and score is gained based on actions completed.    </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13627">Zork I: The Great Underground Empire</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1733417-257971_vampyre_cross_commodore_64_screenshot_title_screen.png</image></root>
