<root><id>20498</id><name>Draglade</name><description>Draglade is a game for the Nintendo DS. A sequel, Custom Beat Battle: Draglade 2 was not released outside of Japan.GameplayThe player takes the role of a Grapper, which is essentially an arena battler that uses a G-Con unit - a device which intakes energy to create a personalized weapon for the user. Combat plays like a beat 'em up with lots of RPG elements in collecting and upgrading components for your G-Con. There is also a music/rhythm element in creating beat combos, which can be strung together with a similar (but very basic) system to Guitar Hero (except the bar is horizontal).</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22394">Slap Happy Rhythm Busters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2199408-box_draglade.png</image></root>
