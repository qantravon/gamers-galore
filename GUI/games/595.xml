<root><id>595</id><name>Tales of Eternia</name><description>Tales of Eternia is the third mothership title in the long running Tales action RPG series that was developed by Wolf Team and published by Namco for the PlayStation in 2000. Namco retitled Eternia to "Tales of Destiny II" when the game was released in North Amercia in 2001, which should not be confused with the actual Tales of Destiny 2 for the PlayStation 2. A port for PlayStation Portable was later released in 2005 in Japan which featured improved loading times and widescreen graphics. Ubisoft distributed an English version of the PSP port to Europe and Australia but it was never released in North America.MechanicsTales of Eternia uses A-LMBS (Aggressive Linear Motion Battle System), a variant of the Tales series' Linear Motion Battle System.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="620">Star Ocean: The Second Story</game><game id="12099">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</game><game id="21447">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</game><game id="15050">Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana</game><game id="1959">Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny</game><game id="10401">Radiata Stories</game><game id="11602">Valkyrie Profile</game><game id="14148">Princess Crown</game><game id="21848">Final Fantasy Type-0</game><game id="14817">Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2</game><game id="21108">Star Ocean: First Departure</game><game id="21464">Star Ocean:  Second Evolution</game><game id="9032">Star Ocean</game><game id="294">Summon Night: Swordcraft Story</game><game id="25690">Ys SEVEN</game><game id="25694">Ys I &amp; II Chronicles</game><game id="6557">Revelations: Persona</game><game id="21202">Dissidia: Final Fantasy</game><game id="27204">Gods Eater Burst</game><game id="29104">Mimana Iyar Chronicle</game><game id="14694">Threads of Fate</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1837511-box_tod2.png</image></root>
