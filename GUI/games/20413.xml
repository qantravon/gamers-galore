The game expands to cover all of Japan's territories, a feature introduced in the second game but dropped in the third, and introduces subordinate generals that assist the daimyo in battle and lend him their strength. The generals were originally introduced in Nobunaga's Ambition's sister series Romance of the Three Kingdoms.The game was released for the US SNES as Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness. However, it is simply known as Nobunaga's Ambition on the Genesis and isn't to be confused with the original NES/SNES Nobunaga's Ambition (which is actually the second in the series, as the first never left Japan).</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26156">Romance of the Three Kingdoms X</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363934-snes_lordofdarkness.jpg</image></root>
