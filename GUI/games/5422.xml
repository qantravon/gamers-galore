Biniax was released as freeware in 2005.The game prides itself on being purely focused on game mechanics.In Biniax, players control a single block, moving through the empty spaces on the game board to match with blocks of the same color. The player then controls a block of the color of the block that the previously matched block was joined to.The screen scrolls downward slowly, increasing in speed with time. The game is over when the player controlled block is pushed off the screen by block pairs that the block can't be matched with. Biniax has been ported to various systems by both the developer and fans of the game. Biniax was originally released for Windows and Linux, but has since been ported to BeOS, Amiga OS4 and consoles such as the n-Gage and Dreamcast. Mobile versions were also made for various Motorola and Nokia phone operating systems of the time.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
