<root><id>18177</id><name>Turbo</name><description>Released by Sega in 1981, Turbo is a single-player racing game that uses a third-person rear-view racer format, much like Namco's famous Pole Position in 1982. Unlike modern racing games, which feature starting and ending points, Turbo contains four screens which loop infinitely until the player runs out of time. In effect, this means that the player has to focus on keeping away from the other cars, as hitting them will cause a crash, rather than trying to win the race.While Pole Position had been licensed by Atari, Turbo was licensed by their rival Coleco. To simulate the arcade experience of the original, the ColecoVision version featured a racing wheel peripheral, which contained a steering wheel, attached gas pedal, and gear shifter that had a high and low setting.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10087">Pole Position</game><game id="3735">Pole Position II</game><game id="2386">Rad Racer</game><game id="2299">Rad Racer II</game><game id="12897">Final Lap Twin</game><game id="6844">Enduro</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/1791293-turbo__sega_.jpg</image></root>
