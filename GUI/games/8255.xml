You play as the pilot of a FireWing combat ship and complete a series of missions in an effort to stop the Drak-Sai before they reach Earth. Get up close and personal with a first-person view of incredible texture-mapped terrains and objects rendered in 32-bit detail. Fight off enemy hordes and bosses with a variety of weapons, each with three levels of firepower.GameplayThe gameplay in Total Eclipse is very similar to that of its predecessor, Solar Eclipse, released for the Sega Saturn and also developed by Crystal Dynamics. The game directed the player down a linear path, on what could be called the "z" axis, as the position of your ship was moveable about the "x" and "y" axis - a mechanic reminiscent of Star Fox.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18161">Solar Eclipse</game><game id="4830">Colony Wars</game><game id="3984">Star Fox</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73970/1287546-totaleclipse_au_front.jpg</image></root>
