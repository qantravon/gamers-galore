<root><id>10292</id><name>League Challenge</name><description>As with many older football management games you pick a team (64 teams are available in this game) and try to get them to top flight football status.  As with my football management games you can train players, buy / sell players.  The only slightly unusual things in League Challenge are that players are offered for sell after each game and you only play one match against each team in a season.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17359">Championship Manager</game><game id="13578">Championship Manager 2</game><game id="17405">Graeme Souness Soccer Manager</game><game id="12508">Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
