It makes use of a a loop-based beat maker, seen in many consumer and professional audio applications, as the main gameplay element. The game displays a set of measures with multiple instruments. A playhead continually scans across a grid, and automatically plays instruments and sounds wherever they are placed in the grid. The goal of the game is to reproduce a specific beat or song from hearing by adding blocks of individual instruments to the appropriate track. Â The art style of the game relies heavily on isometric pixel art, which is a popular form of creating lavish and colorful scenes using 8-bit styled graphics and animations. Each world in the game tells a different "story" through these scenes as you recreate various songs and beats.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15284/1335661-032.png</image></root>
