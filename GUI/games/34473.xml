The player can select a message, modify a walking sprite of Santa Claus and choose a background image and music to accompany the message. Presumably the idea was to set a card up and gift the game to a friend or relative.The secondary mode provides various random generators for gambling games, such as a quintet of dice for Yahtzee (a.k.a. Dice Poker), a spinning roulette wheel or a bingo sheet. The game does not track progress, so the players themselves must be responsible for any scorekeeping.</description><genres><genre id="49">Gambling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39817">Gokuraku Yuugi: Game Tengoku</game><game id="42251">Nazoler Land Soukan Gou</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/1804135-santa.jpg</image></root>
