<root><id>11470</id><name>Scaler</name><description>Overview A colorful platformer with a quirky sense of humor and very alien environments - the comic sense and gameplay bears resemblance to    Ratchet  Clank. The protagonist is transformed into a lizard-type creature and sucked into an alternate universe where he has to find Lizard Eggs before they can be mutated and hatched into monsters by Luger, Jazz, and other lizard enemies with plans for   world domination.  There are numerous extras hidden into the game, such as concept art galleries; and easter eggs like idle animations where Scaler chases his own tail, or the camera acting as a physical game object and shaking when Scaler hits it with his "tongue attack".  The player can eventually gain various transformations that allow variations in game play style, though they cannot be selected at will, everywhere: most planets have a single alternate to Scaler's default lizard form.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14623">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</game><game id="14604">Daxter</game><game id="20351">Kya: Dark Lineage</game><game id="18926">Malice</game><game id="20529">Insecticide</game><game id="12614">Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy</game><game id="15835">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</game><game id="13169">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</game><game id="159">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue</game><game id="19188">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan</game><game id="24969">Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri</game><game id="11407">Vexx</game><game id="8660">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</game><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game><game id="68">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</game><game id="19281">Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</game><game id="3684">Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</game><game id="2906">Psychonauts</game><game id="19388">Ape Escape 3</game><game id="18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</game><game id="4618">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</game><game id="30746">Ruff Trigger: The Vanocore Conspiracy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1801467-box_scaler.png</image></root>
