The player can customise the formation and makeup of their platoons which affects the outcome of battles. Each platoon consists of a leader, such as Rei or MOS, and one to two other ships. If a platoon is defeated the leader must retreat and is no longer available for the rest of the mission, if all leaders retreat the mission ends.

The player can however, rotate and zoom the camera and toggle between following different ships, as well as viewing various statistics as the battle takes place.Between missions, In addition to the game's ship customisation options, it is possible to upgrade and research new ship components.
