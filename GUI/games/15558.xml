<root><id>15558</id><name>Lotus Challenge</name><description>Lotus challenge was a driving game from Kuju Interactive, which incorporated licensing from Lotus. A full range of Lotus cars, past and present, were available for play. The story mode allowed you to play through a fictional career as a Jack or Zoe, a driver for lotus, with events including races (both street and ractetrack) and performing stunts for movies or adverts. Later in the game you were able to race a series of historic Lotus F1 cars.The game was perhaps most notable for it's attempt to revolutionise the way analogue sticks are used for steering. Lotus Challenge offered you the option to use the stick in a circular motion, emulating a steering wheel, and using both axis of the stick instead of one. This system was partially successful in offfering a higher degree of sensitvity, but did not catch on. It was seen by many as a gimmick.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14990">Porsche Challenge</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="531">TOCA Race Driver 2</game><game id="13734">TOCA Race Driver 3</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="4421">Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</game><game id="14801">Lotus Turbo Challenge 2</game><game id="2416">Gran Turismo</game><game id="17784">Gran Turismo 4</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="8100">Gran Turismo 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1796987-box_lotus.png</image></root>
