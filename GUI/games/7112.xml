Similarly, Gamespot attributed Combat Mission II a score of 9.1 out of 10, denoting that "Combat Mission navigates beautifully between... two extremes" which, according to the review, defined war strategy games at the time, namely "burying [the gameplay] under numbers and hexes or dumbing it down with Panzer General-style levels of abstraction and simplicity". The review concludes that "Barbarossa to Berlin raises the wargaming bar even higher with its pitch-perfect, ultra-polished improvements to an already great game".The game won both Computer Gaming World's Editor's Choice and Reader's Choice awards for "Wargame of the Year" for the year 2002.System RequirementsMinimumWindows 98/ME/2000/XPMINIMUM500MHz Processor64MB RAM16MB 800x600 Video CardDirectX 8.0DirectX compatible Sound Card4X CD-ROM Drive1.8GB Hard Disk SpaceRecommended800MHz Processor128MB RAM2.8GB Hard Disk SpaceMultiplayer28.8Kbps Internet Connection</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23152">Panzer Command: Kharkov</game><game id="23150">Panzer Command: Operation Winter Storm</game><game id="21349">Theatre of War</game><game id="39830">Barbarossa</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1018550-522049_front.jpg</image></root>
