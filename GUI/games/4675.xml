Distributed only in Japan, Disney Dancing Museum was still packaged with the series' trademark dance pads. However, because of the storage capacity limitations of Nintendo 64 cartridges, the song list had to be compromised in quantity compared to its counterparts on the PlayStation. Additionally, similar to other tie-in games in the franchise such as Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix, the difficulty was tuned in order to address an audience which was believed to be less hardcore and familiar with Dance Dance Revolution's mechanics.Song ListMickey Mouse March It's a Small World Mickey Motion Jiwaku No Tango Tap!
