Its name essentially means "Kidnapped Princess" or "Vanishing Princess". The player is a detective searching for clues to the eponymous princess' disappearance.GameplayStages are split between maze-like action stages full of ladders and enemies and a world map, which lets you walk around towns and interrogate different people for information, as well as enter buildings. Like River City Ransom, there's a considerable amount of things you can do besides searching for the princess - such as eating in restaurants, training in dojos and selling items you collect. There's also a clock that counts down in real-time that changes the map from day to night.The game was originally released with a story book and audio cassette tape, "feelies" which enhanced the player's understanding and appreciation of the game's plot as well as helping with some of the puzzles. There is a considerable amount of Japanese dialogue within the game proper, so only someone fluent in the language will be able to progress.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40394">Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2247383-250px_kieta_princess_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
