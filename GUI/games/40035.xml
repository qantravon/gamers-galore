Or Kamen Rider for that matter).It was developed by Shouei System (occasionally known as Bear's) for Toei Animation, the publishers of the game and owners of the license. This duo of developer/publisher was also responsible for the NES Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star) games, among other anime licenses.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1653">Ninja Gaiden</game><game id="3482">Shinobi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2343061-kamen_no_ninja_akakage.jpg</image></root>
