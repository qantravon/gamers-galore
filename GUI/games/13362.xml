The player begins with a basic ship that can fire a vulcan straight forward, and can fire enemy-capture missiles.The game begins in typical shoot-em-up fashion, with the player's ship flying alone through a starfield. Rows of basic enemies will then fly in from the right. Around level 4, the levels switch from outer space to interior bio-mechanical themed stages.Enemy CaptureThe game does not make it clear which enemies can and cannot be captured, but most of the capturable enemies are anime styled mecha. Some enemies take multiple hits from the capture missiles before they can be taken over, and others just blow up. The only real way to find out if an enemy can be captured is to pelt them with capture missiles until they turn blue or explode.Each capture-able craft has its own basic and special attacks. Sometimes the special attacks are limited, sometimes they're unlimited, and sometimes they just change the craft's attack mode. As captured enemies take damage, their weapons degrade. If the player damages an enemy before capturing it, they will inherit that damage.Char's CounterattackBlaZeon pulls several mecha designs straight from the 1988 movie Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, including the Nu Gundam, the Geara Doga, and a giant Sazabi torso with the head of the Alpha Azieru. There's also a macross-style mecha, and a mech that could conceivably be a Hobby Hizack.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14476">Thexder</game><game id="1009">Star Soldier</game><game id="15890">Kirby's Adventure</game><game id="4900">Gaiares</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13641/2309096-jpn_cover.jpg</image></root>
