You have the choice between 4 character which kind of act as the "lives" in the game. You start by selecting one of the 4 mercenaries and when that one has dies you choose from one of the 3 remaining. Each mercenary has various weapons and different advantages. You kill your way through various areas in space collecting key cards, destroying as much as you can, protecting various VIP's and finding your way out of the level.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5741">Crusader: No Remorse</game><game id="6021">Crusader: No Regret</game><game id="7382">Loaded</game><game id="11704">Fallout</game><game id="5559">Fallout 2</game><game id="3246">O.D.T. - Escape...
