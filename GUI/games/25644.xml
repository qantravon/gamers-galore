<root><id>25644</id><name>Rolando 3</name><description>Rolando 3 was to be the third game in the Rolando series. Originally set for a November 2009 release with plans for post release support and additional levels, similar to the predecessors of the franchise, but the game was never released.  In February 2010, publisher ngmoco announced its intentions to change its business model to one which focused on releasing free to play games that offer in-app purchase opportunities for premium content. This model could not be applied to Rolando 3 and as a result, the game was cancelled.  </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21111">LocoRoco 2</game><game id="9410">LocoRoco</game><game id="1446">Lemmings</game><game id="27865">LocoRoco Midnight Carnival</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
