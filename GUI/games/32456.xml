When a circle is completed it creates a vacuum which captures enemies that were within or move into the circle. Bonus points are awarded for capturing multiple enemies, and the player loses a life every time the cursor makes contact with an enemy. Drawing requires speed as the line drawn is short lived.The enemies have different movement patterns, speeds and grouping much like enemies in games like Geometry Wars.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8272/1789994-the_revenants___corridor_of_souls___1801.png</image></root>
