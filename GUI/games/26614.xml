The main gameplay mechanic involves twisting the Wii Remote to rotate the environment 90 degrees in  any direction in order to progress and meet goals. This allows for explorations of all corners of he game world and places not accessible in typical platformers. Flip will discover and utilize five magic tools throughout his journey. The game will feature five different worlds. It has been revealed that the game would feature original music from    Tommy Tallarico.  The visual style in the game takes a more kid-friendly approach, with  many colors and childish characters. The game, however, promises a  unique and challenging puzzle platforming adventure for all audiences.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16094">Super Mario Galaxy</game><game id="26839">Super Mario Galaxy 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1245682-twistedworld.jpg</image></root>
