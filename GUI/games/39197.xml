The aim is to sandwich the other player's cats between your own, flipping them to your colour. The winner is the player with the most cats on the board once it is full.The premise comes from the classic board game Reversi (sometimes called Othello), but features social twists and turn-based gameplay not found in other iterations of this classic.Gameplay is asynchronous. Players take turns to place their cat on the board. The other person in the match then receives a push notification on their iOS device to tell them that it is their turn. Players can have multiple matches in progress at anytime and track their progress using statistics and a world ranking system. There is also an in-game IM feature, allowing players to send chat messages to each other while playing.Matchmaking is random, or players can take on their Facebook friends and email contacts.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37865">Gobang Social</game><game id="38802">Reversi</game><game id="35063">Othello</game><game id="37753">Draw Something</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1642/2283395-2_1_1.png</image></root>
