The level featured in the demo does not appear in the full game, but is cut content that was decided to be released as a demo. The demo starts just before the   resonance cascade. The "plot" of the demo is that you have to go and tune the radio satellite so it can sync up with a satellite so that the people at  Black Mesa can contact the outside world so that people would know what is going on at Black Mesa. Uplink was included with the Game of the Year Edition of Half-Life as a mod, and was included with all subsequent releases.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16073">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield</game><game id="8728">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/1385757-uplink.jpg</image></root>
