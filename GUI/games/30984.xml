It had various difficulty levels as well as a high score mechanism.  The success of the game led to  Android Two.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4485">Android Two</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1345396-androidone.jpg</image></root>
