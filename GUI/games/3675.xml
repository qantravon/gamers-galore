After returning to your apartment (following your arrest for whistling a happy tune in the streets) he finds a note informing him of an underground movement to help release the city from its strict overlords. You spend the game solving puzzles, exploring, and talking to people in your quest to find out about the resistance movement and help them with their cause.The game features a mostly 3D engine, which was rare for adventure games of the time. The player uses a voodoo doll to interact with the environment; clicking the arms, eyes, and mouth will instruct Kent to perform various actions.Inventory is handled in a similar pop-up manner, allowing you to combine or use objects by clicking the mouse.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6042">Realms of the Haunting</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4859/833593-normality_cover.jpg</image></root>
