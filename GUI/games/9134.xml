It was released in 1984. Air Raid is a hack of U.S. Games' Space Jockey, which is far easier to come by, boxed or not.On April 10, 2010 a boxed copy (the 13th copy ever made) of Air Raid was auctioned to a collector from Austin, Texas for $31,600. This was thought to be the only properly boxed copy of the game in existence.On November 4, 2012 another boxed copy appeared, complete with instruction manual and box. This went on to sell for $33,433.30.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2251">Space Jockey</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/633647-air_raid_atari_2600.jpg</image></root>
