He wrote, "...This is another behind the vehicle perspective racing game except it's more like Road Rash -- you ride a motorcycle (but there is none of the side-by-side brutal fighting). Getting used to your racer takes some time, but overall it is a good racing game".</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8251">Road Rash</game><game id="12299">Suzuka 8 Hours</game><game id="37312">GP-1: Part II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2102966-gp_1_snes.jpg</image></root>
