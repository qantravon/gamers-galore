However, playing the game for even a short time, or even just looking at the cover, reveals that animal abuse is the entire theme of the game, with the player-controlled weasel subjecting the rabbit to intense pain in order to help himself escape, de-valuing the entire idea of PETA's endorsement.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="96">Kao the Kangaroo</game><game id="14623">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</game><game id="18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543578-box_whiplash.png</image></root>
