<root><id>19542</id><name>James Bond: The Duel</name><description>James Bond: The Duel is a game based on the famous M16 agent      007 which unlike many other later titles, is not based on any movie of the  franchise. Instead, this Bond game is an original storyline that includes familiar    villains of the series such as            Jaws and           Oddjob. Timothy Dalton's likeness is used in the game and it was published by         Domark for the        Sega Master System,       Sega Mega Drive and      Sega Game Gear in 1993 (four years after Dalton's last movie Licence to Kill).  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8179">Elevator Action</game><game id="20656">Bionic Commando</game><game id="3353">Rolling Thunder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5258/539590-200px_james_bond___the_duel_coverart.png</image></root>
