<root><id>3438</id><name>MediEvil II</name><description>OverviewMediEvil II, sequel to the popular MediEvil takes place after the noble but bony Sir Dan Fortesque defeats the evil wizard Zarok. After a new villain by the name of Lord Palethorn arises, poor Dan is awakened along with everything dead and forgotten. The game allows you to explore past levels as well as collecting the Chalice which gives a new weapon once 100% of the souls have been returned in the level. The game has many comedic moments, such as when Sir Dan tries conversing with a bunch of midgets in the city sewers who think he is an almighty God.Weapons and ItemsWeaponsArmShort SwordPistolCane StickHammerBroadswordCrossbowAxeGatling GunChicken DrumstickLightningGood Lightning (Only used to give health from Sir Dan to whoever the target selected is)ItemsBronze ShieldSilver ShieldGold ShieldKeysChalice of Souls (Given to Professor Kift in order to receive new weapon or rewards)Life Bottles and Life Vials (Used to restore health)LevelsThe MuseumTyrannosaurus Wrecks (Boss Fight)KensingtonThe TombThe FreakshowGreenwich Observatory (Parts One and Two) (Mini-Boss Fight with Mander and Dogman)Kew GardensDankenstienIron Slugger (Boss Fight)Wulfrum HallThe Count (Boss Fight)WhitechapelThe SewersThe Time Machine (Parts One and Two)The Ripper (Boss Fight)Cathedral SpiresCathedral Spires: The DecentThe Demon (Final Mini-Boss Fight with Mander/Dogman and Final Boss Fight Against Lord Palethorn and Summoned Demon)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11120">LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga</game><game id="20822">LEGO Batman: The Videogame</game><game id="15773">LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge</game><game id="5857">Dog's Life</game><game id="2906">Psychonauts</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="7549">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</game><game id="20879">Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</game><game id="10384">Jak II</game><game id="14623">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</game><game id="9669">Jak 3</game><game id="21115">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty</game><game id="15212">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</game><game id="18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</game><game id="4966">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</game><game id="4618">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</game><game id="8837">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Size Matters</game><game id="21000">Secret Agent Clank</game><game id="18745">Ratchet: Deadlocked</game><game id="7836">Spyro the Dragon</game><game id="1753">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</game><game id="1563">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage</game><game id="6134">The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night</game><game id="15249">Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy</game><game id="20908">The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon</game><game id="3883">The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning</game><game id="8420">Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly</game><game id="10579">Spyro: Season of Ice</game><game id="12209">Spyro: A Hero's Tail</game><game id="13370">Spyro 2: Season of Flame</game><game id="15353">Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus</game><game id="16337">Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves</game><game id="15573">Sly 2: Band of Thieves</game><game id="8040">Maximo vs Army of Zin</game><game id="10717">Maximo: Ghosts to Glory</game><game id="4973">Xena: Warrior Princess</game><game id="19907">Heretic II</game><game id="5821">Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc</game><game id="577">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</game><game id="8370">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</game><game id="6936">Primal</game><game id="2681">American McGee's Alice</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2372460-box_medievil2.png</image></root>
