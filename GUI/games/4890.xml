<root><id>4890</id><name>Muscle Car 3: Illegal Street</name><description>Muscle Car 3 is a low-budget racing game featuring muscle cars from the 70s. The game builds on its predecessor with 26 cars, 36 courses around the world, and four modes. Players have the option to build a career beginning from an amateur's background, or to play cops-and-speeders as either the cop or the speeder. One can also just drive a single course and race against their best times or a "ghost" version of their best run. The game is built on the Renderware engine.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3198/676620-51dx20j38rl._aa280_.jpg</image></root>
