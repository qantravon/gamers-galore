<root><id>11351</id><name>Lunar Pool</name><description>Lunar Pool is a billiards game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that applies the basic premise and physics of billiards / pool to completely unconventional table designs. The traditional rectangular six-pocket table is eschewed for over 50 odd designs such as tables resembling the letter Z, Tetris shapes, and even bizarre angular monstrosities.  In the options menu, Lunar Pool allows players to manipulate the friction on the tables so that shots travel either farther or shorter distances than normally expected.  Each new table of the game comes with a certain "par" value for counting the number of shots you take to clear the table. This removes Lunar Pool slightly away from the "billiards" feel and more towards a mini-golf and puzzle-game type feel.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11410">Fuzzy's World of Miniature Space Golf</game><game id="26015">Tournament Pool</game><game id="2042">Side Pocket</game><game id="18521">Parlour Games</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362008-nes_lunarpool.jpg</image></root>
