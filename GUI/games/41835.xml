These kingdoms share a delicate balance of power; however, within each kingdom they are vulnerable to internal strife, as each manor has strong desire for self-rule. Players rule supreme in this brutal and beautiful world filled with magical beasts, large scale conflict, territories to conquer and rival clans to battle. With a strong emphasis on PvP, you may find challenges around every corner in Lineage II, but you have the means to protect yourself. Develop your character and obtain the power to enforce your will upon the realm. Seize your destiny and allow your own hand to write the history of this world!</description><genres><genre>MMO</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/2476-1.jpg</image></root>
