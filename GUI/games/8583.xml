It's a side-scrolling, arcade style 2D action game with a heavy emphasis on non-stop action. Players quite literally run through levels, shooting everything in sight. Powerups can be attained usually through rescuing captive soldiers or killing some enemies.  Gameplay Players run and gun mostly and have a pistol with infinite ammo as a default weapon. There are various weapon pickups to be found such as Rocket Launchers, Heavy Machine Guns, Shotguns, and a few other surprises. Grenades can also be thrown. There is also some vehicle gameplay to be had as characters step into various Metal Slugs, The Slug Gunner and The Slug Flyer.  CharactersPlayers have the choice to play as either Walter Ryan or Tyra Elson.  Weapons  Enemy Chaser  Drop Shot Flame Shot Super Grenade Heavy Machine Gun Iron Lizard Laser Rocket Launcher Shotgun</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1421">Ranger X</game><game id="10077">Super C</game><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="4237">Contra 4</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game><game id="11973">Gunstar Super Heroes</game><game id="2853">Operation C</game><game id="20975">Mega Man 9</game><game id="20256">Mega Man X4</game><game id="16948">Mega Man X3</game><game id="9463">Mega Man X</game><game id="7391">Mega Man 7</game><game id="840">Metal Slug 2: Super Vehicle - 001/II</game><game id="6941">Metal Slug: Super Vehicle - 001</game><game id="26481">Bionic Commando</game><game id="30945">Bionic Commando Rearmed 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2314070-box_mslugadv.png</image></root>
