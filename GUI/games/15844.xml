Hart in the PC version of Fade To Black.This 1995 DOS and later  Playstation game, develped by Delphine Software International and published by Electronic Arts, is a sequel to the critically acclaimed  Flashback: The Quest for Identity. The plot follows  Conrad B. Hart, who has awoken from Cryogenic sleep, and has been taken prisoner on the Lunar prison of New Alcatraz. Fade To Black did not receive such good critical response, compared to Flashback, possibly because of un-user-friendly level design and awkward interface. The playstation version is available to download for  PS3 in the EU. The planned sequel, Flashback Legends was canceled due to the company's bankruptcy in 2002.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8870">System Shock 2</game><game id="4549">BlackThorne</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/224/273484-ftbcover.jpg</image></root>
