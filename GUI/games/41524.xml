The teaser site revealed PS3, Xbox 360 and PC as the targeted platforms.Salem Witch Trials?A week after the initial tease the official Twitter for the game tweeted "Evidence: Salem MA USA". When entering the password "salemmausa" into the teaser website, a MP3 file playing the sound of glass breaking followed by a loud thump could be heard. The sound file lined up with the initial teaser image of a person lying, presumably, dead next to broken pieces of glass.In 1692, Salem Massachusetts went through a witch hunt known widely as the Salem Witch Trials. It's speculated that the game will take place in that time period, or at least in or around Salem.First Teaser TrailerOn February 19th 2013 the first teaser trailer for the game was shown, ending with the tagline 'The hardest murder to solve is your own'.
