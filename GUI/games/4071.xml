Paul Armstrong of the "Federation of Earth", finds himself forced to single-handedly take on the Velians when they attack his ship.Unofficial ModsOperation: Matriarchy, as released, contained no in-game music, but in August 2007, a fan-made mod was released, adding a complete score and enhanced sound effects to the game. Also, the story was rewritten.Later, in September 2009, a second fan-made mod was release-- this one offered a complete (yet completely optional) translation to German and even further changes to the in-game sound effects and music. However, this mod is mostly known for the introduction of massive changes to the visuals, adding enhanced lighting and improved versions of many textures and bump maps.LinksOfficial Websitehttp://www.madia.ru/matriarchy.html</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1403/536644-920284_20050512_screen011.jpg</image></root>
