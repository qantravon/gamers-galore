It is a remake of Half- Life's mutiplayer component, Deathmatch Classic, using the Source Engine. It has recieved a backlash for little graphical updates (only water and ragdolls are the most notable difference), changes in physics and has a very tiny userbase.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/64/1417212-header.jpg</image></root>
