<root><id>37479</id><name>Flying Nightmares</name><description>Flying Nightmares is simply described as a jet simulator. Players pilot a AV-8B Harrier II in a fictional theatre set against the rebellious forces entrenched upon Barcala Island. What exactly these forces are rebelling against is a mystery but their forces show some variety in the form of F-16, f-5 Mark IIs, A-4 Skyhawks, the odd C-130 Hercules and the ever-common UH-1 Huey helicopter. Ground forces do pop up from time to time but thanks to pop-in they are nearly impossible to see.The manual encourages the purchase of a flight stick for use with the game- the alternative is wrestling with an arcane set of controller commands that often require simultaneous button presses. At least one of these is easy to remember: the eject command demands pressing left shoulder, right shoulder, play and stop all at the same time. Amusingly, it has a similar command to jettison all weaponry by pressing left and right shoulder simultaneously.Also, it has a kicking rad 90's intro.</description><genres><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365612-3do_flyingnightmares.jpg</image></root>
