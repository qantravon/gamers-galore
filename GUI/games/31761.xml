His story begins with his homeworld being destroyed - his civilization, The Greys, sought a way to combat the fierce overpopulation of their planet by creating a synthetic super-being called the Terracon which was able to terraform previously uninhabitable planets to hold their growing population. However, when The Greys attempted to terminate Terracon after its' job was over, it became self-aware and resisted. Its' first act of defiance was to destroy The Grey's homeworld. The only survivor of this was the small alien Xed, who immediately begun his quest for vengeance.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56729/1405365-terracon_pal.jpg</image></root>
