Right now, he's looking to make money on Twibbles, the latest trendy alien pet, before the fad is over. In order to make money for the initial investment, he goes to the Altairian star system in search of treasures, where he stumbles upon a deep network of underground chambers filled with alien technology, treasures, traps and puzzles.Equipped with a "laser pistol" (which actually shoots missiles) and the ability to jump, he must fight his way out, harvesting all the riches of the caves as he progresses. All this in colorful EGA graphics. The gameplay is actually identical to that of another Apogee game, Secret Agent: The Hunt for Red Rock Rover.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21209">Commander Keen</game><game id="3218">Digger T.
