The reason it lacks any sort of numerical is because the first game was never released outside of Japan. In Japan, this game is known as The Black Bass II, but as it was the first in the series to be released in the US the publishers simply dropped the "II".As with the original game the goal is to catch as many of the eponymous fish as possible within the time limit that the game's central fishing competition enforces. Players must select their bait or lure, choose a good spot in the lake to start fishing and then patiently wait and then hook any black bass that come along.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="27">Fishing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11652">Black Bass</game><game id="6169">The Blue Marlin</game><game id="11423">Black Bass: Lure Fishing</game><game id="26887">Super Black Bass Fishing</game><game id="31331">Super Black Bass</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361174-nes_blackbass.jpg</image></root>
