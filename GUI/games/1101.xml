Bandai Namco Games released the game alongside the PlayStation 3 in November 2006. It is also one of the first games that allows users to install a chunk of the game to the PS3's hard drive, ostensibly to reduce load times.As usual, the gameplay in Ridge Racer 7 features wild, arcade-style racing with a heavy drift style that, at times, feels like the player has very little to do with the way the car deftly pitches around curves. RR7 also adds the ability to slipstream behind other racers, and it also contains some vehicle customization.Online play is also included with support up to 14 players, and Ridge Racer 7 also sports downloadable content. These range from free downloadable decals to purchasable music that can be played in-game.You have the option of playing a mini-game; Xevious, when loading the game.Gameplay ModesSingle PlayerRidge State Grand PrixManufacturer's TrialsUFRA Single EventExtreme Battle (Not unlocked until completion of main Grand Prix)MultiplayerGlobal Time AttackStandard RacePair Time AttackTeam BattlePair BattleUFRA Special EventMulti Race</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="8779">Sega GT 2002</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="12805">Initial D: Special Stage</game><game id="21657">Initial D: Extreme Stage</game><game id="12976">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</game><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="20645">Mario Kart Wii</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="24866">OutRun Online Arcade</game><game id="23570">GTI Club+: Rally CÃ´te d'Azur</game><game id="6368">Mickey's Speedway USA</game><game id="24513">DiRT 2</game><game id="42324">Ridge Racer Driftopia</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1832162-box_rr7.png</image></root>
