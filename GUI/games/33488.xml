It is a purposefully bad version of       Super Meat Boy in a style similar to handheld games developed by      Tiger Electronics in the early 1990s. The game's description on the     iTunes Store gives humorous descriptions such as "All the branding of Super Meat Boy without a lot of the FUN! PERFECT!" and "Impress your friends with its custom backgrounds and sounds!" Â The game was made in response to Team Meat developer  Tommy Refenes's rant at Game Developer Conference 2010 calling the iPhone App Store "the Tiger Handheld game of this generation" due to constant watered-down ports (including bad controls) of popular games.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1456">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4</game><game id="9957">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</game><game id="6727">Game &amp; Watch Gallery</game><game id="24018">Game &amp; Watch Collection 2</game><game id="15254">Game &amp; Watch Collection</game><game id="17416">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1662579-smbhicon.png</image></root>
