The title "Madden NFL 25" is a nod to the twenty-fifth anniversary of the series. Past entries were typically titled with the year of the current season's playoffs and Super Bowl. (i.e., Madden NFL 25 would have otherwise been known as Madden NFL 14.)Cover AthleteFor the second year in a row, ESPN's show SportsNation teamed up with EA Sports to host a poll in which fans would eventually select the cover athlete from a field of 64. This year, however, one bracket was current players, referred to as "new school," and one bracket was legends, referred to as "old school." The winners of each bracket were Adrian Peterson, current running back for the Minnesota Vikings, and Barry Sanders, a Hall of Fame running back formerly of the Detroit Lions. Barry Sanders was announced as the winner, winning 58% of votes, at a ceremony broadcast on ESPN2 live from New York City and became the cover athlete for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game.  At its 2013 E3 press conference, EA announced that Adrian Peterson, the cover vote runner-up, would be the cover athlete for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 SKUs.Anniversary EditionAn Anniversary Edition of Madden NFL 25 was made available on Amazon.com for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game.  This edition, along with the game, includes a 17 week Madden Ultimate Team pack subscription; a code for a 2013 regular season (17-week) trial of NFL Sunday Ticket on computers, tablets, and mobile devices; and "exclusive offers for DirecTV and NFL Sunday Ticket."</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2488290-box_madden25.png</image></root>
