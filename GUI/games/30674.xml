Lovecraft, featuring charming pixel art graphics  and an innovative fully voiced dynamic narrative system.            The main character starts the game lost and confused in a large overgrown graveyard, after accidentally summoning legions of tentacled monsters through reding the dreaded Octonomicon. With your trusty shotgun and precious few shells you must fight to survive until dawn breaks.  The game's dynamic narration consists of a high quality voice-over commenting on your actions and the environments you explore. Written and performed in a very Lovecraftian style, this innovative game mechanic expands both the mood and atmosphere of the game.  The developers sought to expand upon the concept of a player created narrative that would work as an alternative for cutscenes and other concepts that distance the players actions from the narrative.Night of the Cephalopods was originally created during the (then) Toronto-based Artsy Games Incubator event.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32085">Bastion</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/78809/1325246-cephalopod2.png</image></root>
