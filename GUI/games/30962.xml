<root><id>30962</id><name>Macross: Eternal Love Song</name><description>A fairly straightforward strategy game that was similar to the Nectaris games on the platform.  The story was based after the events in "Macross: Do You Remember Love", featuring original characters.  The appeal of the game was largely the cinematics and the Macross license, since there were no shortage of generic turn based strategy games at the time.    Reviews at the time cited the game for excessive load times before every battle, drawing out the game time to frustrating lengths.  There is an option to disable the battle visuals, but then you were basically removing the biggest appeal of the game, turning it into a rather ugly map-based game.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2768">Nectaris</game><game id="4152">Military Madness</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5280/1344786-tc_macross_els.jpg</image></root>
