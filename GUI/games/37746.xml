Instead of controlling the particle directly, you change the amplitude and frequency of its wave pattern with the mouse. Stretch and shrink its path to collect photons, avoid dark matter, and go through light gates to increase your multiplier and your score.As you progress through the solar system, you encounter mirrors, wormholes, asteroids, gas clouds, fireworks, and particle accelerators that can change your path, clear away obstacles, or destroy you outright. The photon path also becomes trickier, forcing you to change your wavelength mid-arc to collect them and avoid damage.Some stages require a certain number of stars to unlock; you earn stars by improving your score on previous levels.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP or higherProcessor: 1 GHzMemory: 512 MBHard Disk Space: 850 MBVideo Card: OpenGL compatible graphics card with 128 MB of memorySound: Any sound card capable of stereo outputMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: Intel, 1GHz or higherMemory: 512 MBHard Disk Space: 850 MBVideo Card: OpenGL compatible graphics card with 128 MB of memorySound: Any sound card capable of stereo output</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2153926-header_292x136.jpeg</image></root>
