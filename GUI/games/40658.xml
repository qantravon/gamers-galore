The biggest differential between the two games was the fact that Blitz SE had an updated roster for the respective upcoming NFL season. All features and modes return from Blitz 2001.ReleaseBlitz SE was part of a special Blockbuster promotion, giving Blockbuster the exclusive release and sales for the game. Blockbuster initially had put it on shelves as a "rent only" title, but the game was placed on sale in their stores just weeks later. Because of this, the game was not widely available and did not produce sales numbers akin to those of previous Blitz releases. Razor Freestyle Scooter for the Nintendo 64 was also released under the same sales structure.</description><genres><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12669">NFL Blitz 2001</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/159721/2377041-box.jpg</image></root>
