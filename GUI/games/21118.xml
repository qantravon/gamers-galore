<root><id>21118</id><name>Super Stardust Portable</name><description>A handheld version of the popular PSN title Super Stardust HD by Housemarque.First shown at E3 2008, the title attempts to replicate the twin stick gameplay using the PSP's analog nub for movement and the face buttons for shooting. As the face buttons do not offer the precision of a stick, they can be tapped repeatedly to mimic shooting over a wider arc, and all four can be held down to mimic the action of twirling the right stick on DualShock 3. The D-Pad is used to select weapons.The developers are aiming for a solid 60 frames per second experience, with gameplay and modes adapted for the portable console.The game has online high score lists, one for each mode.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22478">PowerUp Forever</game><game id="19512">Undertow</game><game id="20715">Rocket Riot</game><game id="35502">Super Stardust Delta</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/2133155-ssd_portable.jpg</image></root>
