Trautman and the rest of the US forces. It generally follows events from the movie, including scenes with Co-Bao and Murdock.The game plays more like a non-linear action-adventure game  which plays like a non-linear side-scrolling action RPG similar to Zelda II or Valis.Rambo only has his knife to attack initially, though he can find various projectile weapons with finite ammo. The starting area has a number of helpful NPCs who provide Rambo with information about the game, but the rest of the world is populated with vicious animals such as tigers and bees.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16241">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</game><game id="1619">Ikari Warriors</game><game id="10360">Mercs</game><game id="6850">Commando</game><game id="13100">Blazing Thunder</game><game id="13439">The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</game><game id="13423">Operation Secret Storm</game><game id="6712">Metal Gear</game><game id="14750">Airborne Ranger</game><game id="4208">Ys III: Wanderers from Ys</game><game id="40042">Super Rambo Special</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/235001-rambo.jpg</image></root>
