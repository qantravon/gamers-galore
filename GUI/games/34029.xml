It appears to be identical to Artdink's PSP Gundam Battle series in most respects.  Like the Gundam Battle games, a custom pilot is created (the game appears to return to the faceless pilots of            Gundam Battle Universe, as opposed to the customizable portraits from           Gundam Assault Survive) and is then assigned a variety of parameters, including Oldtype/Newtype, Allegiance, and primary Operator. The player then chooses a Gundam era and completes a list of missions based on said era.  Each mission consists of several objectives, such as "destroy all enemies", "destroy key enemy," or "collect all objects" that must be completed within a time limit.  Most of the HUD has been moved to the 3DS's touch screen.  Scenarios One Year War (UC 0079): Mobile Suit Gundam movies  Gryps Conflict (UC 0087): Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation  Second Neo Zeon War (UC 0093): Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack  Other seriesMobile Suit Gundam Unicorn   OperatorsMiyu Takizawa (     From Place Beyond the Blaze) Ann Friberg (        MS Sensen 0079)Hoa Blanchett ( MS Sensen 0079)Ellen Rochefil (  Climax U.C.)Noel Anderson (   Lost War Chronicles)Yuuki Nakasato (    Lost War Chronicles)Female Soldier (The 08th MS Team)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/1693917-gundam3d.jpg</image></root>
