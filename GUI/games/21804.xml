The concept of the game remained the same in Root Beer Tapper but with the        alcohol focus (Budweiser) replaced with root beer.    Challenge Round In between levels, there is a       mini-game of watching a gentleman shake up each can of root beer except for you. Then shuffles them around, and you have to pick the unshaken one to win the Challenge Round. Reward for getting it correct is extra points, picking the wrong one results in the shaken root beer spraying in the player's face, then the real can is revealed.  Themes Country-Western Bar with Cowboys (2 Levels) Sporting Event with Athletes (3 Levels)     Punk Bar with Rockers (4 Levels) Space Bar with Aliens (4 Levels)Xbox LIVE ArcadeMidway released a modified version of Root Beer Tapper on the      Xbox LIVE Arcade at 400 Microsoft Points ($5.00). This version featured enhancements such as     achievements,    leaderboards, multiplayer and   co-op.  Though the co-op is misleading, as the 2 players in the game never see each other's screen or work on screen together. Instead, they are playing the game separately and after each level and challenge round, scores are compared to see who is winning or losing.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3414">Paperboy</game><game id="24658">Burger Island</game><game id="25689">Bonsai Barber</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/956018-2598108635_718923dc9b.jpg</image></root>
