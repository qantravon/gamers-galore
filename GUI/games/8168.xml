<root><id>8168</id><name>Halls of the Things</name><description>  Halls of the Things has you playing as a character that must explore 7 levels of a tower and fetch the seven rings that will give you access to the basement. Once there you can get the key to lower the drawbridge and escape.    The game itself runs extremely fast and is very hard to control (see   here for an example from a remake that runs at the same speed) and had no sounds at all. The character could shoot arrows or use a sword to fight the monsters and could also cast lightning or fireball spells. Both health and mana could be restored by finding items around the levels. The game had a follow up Return of the Things.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31194">Return of the Things</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1364504-hallsofthethings3.jpg</image></root>
