<root><id>14814</id><name>Gyrodine</name><description>OverviewGyrodine is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls a helicopter. The game is like a more methodically-paced Xevious, as the player has the option of switching between air-to-air and air-to-surface weaponry in order to take out enemies in the skies and on the ground respectively. The screen has some limited horizontal scrolling as well, allowing for a wider field in which to move around.The goal of the game, as with all early shoot-em-ups, is to make it to the end of each stage. There are no bosses, but the regular enemies get progressively more difficult the further the player goes.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9833">Tiger-Heli</game><game id="1487">Xevious</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/572071-girons0f.jpg</image></root>
