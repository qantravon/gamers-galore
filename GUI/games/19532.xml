<root><id>19532</id><name>Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars</name><description>PlotThe story of this game could be considered a prequel to the previous Zone of the Enders game. The main character Cage Midwell is a young teenage boy that finds himself in a new experimental LEV when his ship is attacked by a Black orbital frame. He ends up on mars and is quickly accused of being the one that brought down the ship he was on. The story is more in line with the anime version of zone of the enders. The story is mostly about Cage wanting to find the Black orbital frame to seek revenge. In the process he discovers that the LEV he discover is actually a a new experimental Orbital Frame (OF) similar to Jehuty in the playstation version of the Zone of the enders series.GameplayThe IAS systemThe gameplay consist of a turn-based tactical fighting. This is very different from the action based gameplay that the PlayStation series is mostly known for. The usual game flow consist of a intro story sequence, battling a group or boss and ending sequence. The intro and ending sequence is where most of the story take place except for the very few battle events. In between each episode you have the opportunity to to buy equipment for your LEV upgrade part to improve stats, and obtain new weapons and abilities to use during combat. The fight is similar to that of a tactics game like Advance Wars where the player moves close to the enemy to perform an attack and vice-versa. When you launch an attack you are taken to a screen with the enemy and a cursor and you have to aim at the enemy or at a weak point for more damage. The same is also done when an enemy attacks you except you have to avoid his cursor so he can miss. This can be done manually or the cpu can control the cursor and aim, but the computer uses the character's stats to determine if you hit or miss, increasing the difficulty of the game.CharactersAll information taken from in-game information screensCage MidwellGender: MaleAge: 17Blood Type: OOccupation: Bonaparte III Crew MemberA kindhearted, gentle youth. Began working on board the Bonaparte III along with Ares, whom he met a year earlier. Born 17 years ago to an unknown mother on the cargo deck of the Midwell, which was smuggling illegal immigrants, Cage was raised on the ship by the Captain, who took the boy under his wing. Though he was treated well by fellow Midwell staff, Cage always harbored a feeling of loneliness and isolation in his heart, which translated into low self-esteem and overly passive behavior. When the Captain did and Midwell was deemed unfit for flight, Cage boarded Bonaparte III, where he met Ares. His new friendship with this boy, who was the same age as him and yet seemed so mature, had a profound effect on Cage, and helped him recover from his psychological wounds. However, the knowledge that he owes his rebirth to Ares has proven problematic in itself, as Cage depends on Ares entirely, and suspects that he will never be able to exist independently of him.Ares EnduwaGender: MaleAge: 17Blood Type: ABOccupation: Bonaparte III Crew MemberA co-worker of Cage aboard the Bonaparte III, a colonist spacecraft linking Earth and Mars. Having already worked on Bonaparte III for 4 months when Cage first boarded a year earlier, Ares showed Cage the ropes. Something of a genius, the normally taciturn Ares met Cage late one night after work when he was playing a "piano" that he had conjured by altering a program on a PC in the ship's lobby. Cage happened upon his impromptu concert and was so moved that he began talking to him. At first, Ares was irked by the intrusion, but he eventually gave in to Cage's perseverance and found himself, much to his own surprise, becoming Cage's friend and looking after him. Fellow Bonaparte staff dubbed the unlikely pair "The Eighth Wonder Of Bonaparte."Myona AlderanGender: FemaleAge: 17Blood Type: AA mysterious girl found hiding in a storage room on board the Bonaparte III. Since the accident involving the unidentified object, she sticks with Cage and his group. Having suffered retrograde amnesia since the incident, what little personal information that is known of Myona has been pieced together based on occasional hints about her past. Though she sometimes hints at a determined and headstrong personality hidden deep inside, she is shy and rarely acts aggressively. Serious yet somehow flighty, she also seems slightly imbalanced, which may have something to do with her loss of memoryâ€¦Mech ReferenceThe mechs in Zone of the Enders can be broken down into 2 catergories. The most common are the LEVs (Laborius Extra-Orbital Vehicle), develped to facilitate the building of space stations and colonies. Manned Vehicle used for transportation in space.
