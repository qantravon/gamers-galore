The game is available for free download on Fearon's site, Bagfull Of Wrong.GameplayDespite the title, Squid Yes! Not So Octopus! Squid Harder! is a typical arena shooter. It features four levels, each were you have to survive for 1, 2, 3, and 4 minutes respectively. Each level has a different enemy distribution. The game features a track on the border of each level, with invincible enemies that constantly circle the outside of the arena to prevent the player from simply staying in a corner. The player is represented as a squid flying a UFO shaped craft that is capable of firing a constant stream of lasers in a scattershot formation. All enemies, and the player himself, are destroyed in one shot. The player is also killed if he comes in contact with any of the enemies. Most of the Enemies are incapable of firing at the player, and instead follow him around attempting to touch him, and destroy him, however there are some that can shoot back.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/36674/1091266-synso2.jpg.png</image></root>
