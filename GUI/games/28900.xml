The production would be passed onto  Stern Pinball, the successor to  Sega Pinball.Coarse LanguageThe amount of coarse language depends of the machine's language rating. The game has two ratings PG-13 and G. When the language switch is on PG-13 the game will use mild language and like the show all expletives are bleeped out. When the language switch is on G the language will be watered down so it can be acceptable for family-friendly places (i.e. When the "Kill Kenny" Hurry Up mode is successfully completed, Kyle will say "rats" instead of shouting "you bastards!"). The family mode will also alter the match sequence which features Terrance  Phillip belching instead of farting. The prototype ROM set for the game had all expletives unbleeped.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33171">Marvel Pinball</game><game id="26405">ZEN Pinball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1156245-sppin.jpg</image></root>
