It was developed by NCS Corporation and released in North America in 1990.PlotIn Target Earth, a band of outcasts who left Earth have become cyborgs, and they are returning with a vengeance. As Rex, a pilot for Earth, the player must fight against the cyborg invasion and put a stop to the war.GameplayTarget Earth features two types of play. For ground based missions, the game plays very much like a 2D platformer. Enemies will attack from side to side as well as by air. The space-based levels are similar to side scrolling shoot'em ups like R-Type. With every enemy the player kills, they earn ports that can be spent on weapon upgrades. Bonus weapons can be unlocked at the end of each mission depending on player performance. The game does not feature any sort of collectable health power-up. Instead, the player's health regenerates over time.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19209">Cybernator</game><game id="31791">Night Slave</game><game id="40646">Kisou Ryouhei Gunhound EX</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389446-genesis_targetearth.jpg</image></root>
