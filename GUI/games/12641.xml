It is notable for being the first major homegrown Korean RPG property to find success outside of Korea, attracting enough interest from Japan to convince Softmax to migrate the series over to more lucrative console releases.PlotAs the titular "Phantom of Avalanche" (So described for his martial arts technique honed in the snow-covered mountains), the story follows Calintz, adopted son of King Helios and former elite royal guard. It focuses on a civil war of sorts erupting in his home state of Shudelmir between the throne and upstart faction Vermillion, and the game of thrones played between deposed princess Juclecia and the new empress, Leona.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9778/2196596-magna_carta_the_phantom_of_avalanche_cover.jpg</image></root>
