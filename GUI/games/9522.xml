It is the first game in the series to appear on the SNES, and the first to be localized for and published in America.PlotOkay, so the plot is a bit strange.The game takes place in a cartoonish representation of feudal Japan. The story follows Goemon and Ebisumaru's ( Kid Ying and Dr Yang in the non-Japanese releases) journey across Japan to rescue Princess Yuki, who had been kidnapped by the Otafu Army. Along the way, they fight past all manner of ninjas, monsters, ghosts, quiz-show hosts, villiagers, and robots.GameplayThe game is divided into multiple Warlock Zones, each one representing a different area around Japan. Each zone is split into two sections:The first section is a pseudo-3D villiage area where the protagonists fight against the various locals while  shopping for health items and powerups. These sections also host the game's  minigames, where players can take a break from the main game and earn extra cash and bonus items. The second section is a 2D side-scrolling platforming level. These levels contain the majority of the combat, and end with a climactic  boss fight.MinigamesGame Center, hosted by Konami GirlThe Legend of the Mystical Ninja has numerous minigames within the villiage areas in each stage. Some are within the Game Center area, while others are located in various homes and shopping centers in the level. Most of the games have a fee or opening wager to play, but usually have a way for the player to win cash or special prizes.GradiusLocated in the Game Center. This is the first level of Konami's classic side-scrolling shooter, Gradius.Tear Down The WallLocated in the Game Center.

There is an entry fee of $100, with the chance to win $300.DiceRoll the bonesIn some houses around the game, there is a woman who will offer to play a game of dice. In the game, three dice are rolled, and the player guesses whether the outcome will be 10 or lower, or 11 or higher. The player places a bet which they can double if they guess correctly, or lose if they guess wrong.Fortune-TellingThe fortune-teller offers to read Goemon's future for a $50 fee. He will tell the player that something good, something bad, or nothing will happen. Based on his vision of the future, immediately upon exiting his house the player will encounter five Geishas (which can be collected for $50 each), five spear-toting villagers, or nothing at all.MazeOne of the many game-house barkersUp to two players can pay a $100 entry fee to explore a first-person labyrinth. Prizes hidden in the depths of the maze include bombs, scrolls, and cash that if found, are worth more than the fee taken at the door.LotteryBuy a ticket and participate in the game lottery.

Konami ManThe character with the winged hat who appears above the entrance to the Maze minigame is Konami Man. He was Konami's official mascot at the time The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was created. Konami Man was the star of a Japan-only Nintendo Famicom game called Wai Wai World. Deleted SceneThe Japanese version of The Legend of the Mystical Ninja contained a storefront in the Amusement Park zone that was not present in the American release. Even though it is mentioned in the instruction manual as "Sammy Rye's Circus Side Show," it does not appear in the actual game. For a fee, Goemon can enter the side show and see four clones of Ebisumaru do a short dance. TakosukeOn the bridge leading away from the Amusement Park zone on Awaji Island, the player encounters Takosuke. This huge red octopus is another of Konami's characters, who appears in the Parodius series. In the vignette that follows this level, Takosuke can be seen in the background, climbing the Konami headquarters building on Awaji.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2388">StarTropics</game><game id="9245">Wonder Boy in Monster World</game><game id="17335">Zoda's Revenge: Star Tropics II</game><game id="2941">Chuck Rock</game><game id="93">Flying Warriors</game><game id="6608">River City Ransom</game><game id="34456">Deae Tonosama Appare Ichiban</game><game id="39511">Mito Koumon</game><game id="40170">Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuuki</game><game id="40218">Momotaro Matsuri</game><game id="17548">Super Ninja Boy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363924-snes_legendofthemysticalninja.jpg</image></root>
