The player assumes the role of a spearman named Jinrai (or Imoto, in the English version) who barely survives a massive battle only to find that the village he wakes up in is beset by demonic entities from a nearby cave that leads to the abyss.Jinrai/Imoto is a powerful but slow spear-user that can eventually learn a few spells to make him a little more versatile in combat. He can also upgrade his spear to fire small energy bolts, extending its range. The goal is to make it to the end of each of the eight stages and defeat a boss, which is when new magic spells are acquired.The US version is largely left unchanged, except for a few details in the story and the usual censoring of tanuki testes and Swastika-like manji symbols.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31636">Majyuuou</game><game id="7450">Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts</game><game id="11443">Super Castlevania IV</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2266040-musya.jpg</image></root>
