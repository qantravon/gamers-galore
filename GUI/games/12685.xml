It is the handheld version of Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. The Nintendo DS version uses cel-shaded graphics and has a behind-the-back view similar to the console version of the game.

In Los Angeles, he meets a comicbook artist named Mindy who acts as the player's guide.The main goal of the game is to restore Mindy's favorite skate park, the run-down American Sk8land. Throughout each level the player meets and impresses many real-life skaters and completes goals to earn money that can be used to purchase pieces for the skate park.GameplayThe gameplay is similar to traditional Tony Hawk games and involves the player skating around a level and completing goals by performing tricks or completing tasks. Although it contains most of the moves of Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, the ability to get off of the board and walk around was removed.The game is played on the top screen with the bottom screen being used as a map. Although moves are performed using the d-pad and buttons, special moves can be accesed by hittnig icons on the Nintendo DS's touch screen.

After a bailout, the player can tap the touch screen to fill up a "freak-out" meter that will salvage some of the points earned.Online FeaturesAn example of a user-created skate deck.Tony Hawk's American Sk8land was the first third party game for the Nintendo DS to utilize Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
