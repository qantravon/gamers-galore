It is revealed that the current dystopian world, which Mishima rules over with an iron fist, is not what the world is destined to be, and is an alternate timeline created through the use of a magical sword called the Daikatana, which allows its wielder to travel through time. The protagonist takes the form of a martial arts instructor named Hiro Miyamoto. Hiro, along with partners Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara, attempts to recover the Daikatana and return the Earth to the way its meant to be, travelling to ancient Greece (1200 BC), medieval Norway (560 AD), near future Los Angeles (2030 AD) and futuristic Kyoto (2455 AD) in the process.</description><genres><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14438-1.jpg</image></root>
