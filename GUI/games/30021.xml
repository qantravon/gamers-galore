<root><id>30021</id><name>Game Room</name><description>Overview    Game Room is a free-to-download "virtual arcade" shell developed by                 Krome and released by                Microsoft for the                        Xbox 360 (via                     Xbox Live Arcade) and                        PC (via                    Games for Windows - Live) on March 24, 2010, offering               Atari 2600 games,              Intellivision games, and pre-1990             arcade games (by         Atari and            Konami). Playing the classic games themselves must be bought from the Game Room service (after downloading free "Game Packs"), with the exception of a quick 10-minute demo session. Players can also customize their "virtual arcade", filling rooms with arcade machines, themes, objects, and game mascots. These virtual arcades are filled up by their friends'        Xbox Live avatars. The original March 24, 2010 release included two Game Packs with 15 games each. Between May 5, 2010 and December 22, 2010, Microsoft released 11 additional Game Packs consisting of 12-15 games each. This adds up to a total of 189 games. Game Room has 50     achievements worth 1000 gamerscore. Only 7 of these achievements (worth 80  gamerscore) do not require you to purchase a full game or single play. Game ModesAll games in Game Room can be played in Classic Mode. Most games, especially arcade games, also has a special Ranked Mode.   Classic Mode Classic  mode is direct emulation that lets you freely control how the game is  played. These games can be played in single-player or local multi-player,  depending on how many players are playable in the game. Arcade games can  have customization DIP settings (allowing you to change various settings in the game) while Atari 2600 games gives you access  to the Atari 2600 console interface. You can save and load game states  at any time and have the option to rewind time (similar to      Braid) using the "Time  Warp" interface. Ranked ModeRanked mode lets you play a single single-player session with the default game settings, sending your final score to the global                        leaderboards.  The top player of the Friends List leaderboard for that game is always shown  above the game's cabinet. You cannot rewind time  or let another player join (to prevent imminent death). Ranked Mode requires an Internet connection and is the only way to gain Point Buster and Survivalist medals.Challenge ModeA special variation of Ranked Mode, Challenge Mode allows players to send challenges to up to 7 of their friends (though they  must buy the full version in order to accept the challenge). Challenges  can either be highest score or longest time survived, and can have a  time limit for both the session and the challenge itself. Challenge  starters can also load up a ranked replay and pause the game at a  particular place to start the challenge.MedalsEach game includes up to three types of medals to unlock:Point Buster - For games with ranked mode. The final score in that session.Survivalist - For games with ranked mode. How long the player lasts in the session.Time Spender - A cumulative timer that shows how long the game has been played in total.The medals are ranked Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each with requirements that must be fulfilled. (Either by reaching a certain score, lasting a given amount of time, and playing the game for a certain time) Gaining medals increase "medal points" (2 for bronze, 3 for silver, 5 for gold). For every 20 "medal points", your Game Room profile gains a level. Gaining levels gives you access to more themes and decorations.  Virtual ArcadeEvery player has their own individual arcade, which is automatically populated by some of the player's friends list. The arcade is three stories tall with four rooms for each story. The owner can change themes and add games and decorations for each room. You can also join friends' arcades or a "showcase" arcade containing the latest additions. PricingWhen a new game becomes available, you have a one-play 10-minute demo of Classic Mode for that game. You may use 5 tokens granted to you (by other people playing games on your arcade) to start another one-play 10-minute demo session. Both sessions do not count for leaderboards or ranked medals.  Access to these machines past the 10-minute demo session requires actual payment:Single Game (40 msp, $0.50) - Allows you to play one Ranked Mode game.Full Game (240 msp, $3.00) - Gives you unlimited access to the game (both Classic and Ranked Modes) on either Xbox 360 or PC and allows you to place the game anywhere in the arcade. After the Play Anywhere option was discontinued, Full Game now gives you access on both the Xbox 360 and PC.Play Anywhere (400 msp, $5.00) - No longer used. Previously gave you unlimited access to the game on both Xbox 360 and PC.If you purchased an arcade game on the first day it was released you would unlock a "mascot" for the specific game. "Mascots" are extruded sprites from the games. Once you place the arcade machine in your arcade the "mascot" will be able to freely roam around. If you don't manage to buy the game on launch day, you can pay a small fee (40 msp) for the mascot of your choice.
