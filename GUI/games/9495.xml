<root><id>9495</id><name>Killing Cloud</name><description>You play the part of a futuristic rookie cop in a chilling and lawless San Francisco in the year 1997.  Someone or something has created a huge and deadly cloud of poison gas (the Killing Cloud) which drifted over the entire bay area, leaving only the upper levels of skyscrapers safe for human occupation.  A mysterious gang known as the Black Angels led by the even more mysterious Trinity, are attempting to wipe out what's left of the city's law enforcement, and they are making a pretty good job of it too. Your task is to patrol the city in your flying XB500 hover bike, completing your assigned missions and attempting to discover more about the Angels and their fiendish intentions.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12456">G-Police</game><game id="4030">Blade Runner</game><game id="21200">Blade Runner</game><game id="14485">Future Cop LAPD</game><game id="8237">Helicops</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/1135775-killing_cloud_the.gif</image></root>
