The player must complete a variety of different missions through the completion of objectives, some of these take place in notable locations from historical events or, in the case of the mission " The Bridge Over the River Kwai", famous war films. To complete these objectives there are a number of commandos the player can take control of, all of which have their own special abilities.As the commandos are deep behind enemy lines, the maps are flooded with enemy units, patrolling the area and guarding specific points. To avoid detection the commandos must take out enemies silently. The game is mostly focused around this stealth concentrated type of game play. To help with this, player can see enemy soldiers viewing area. This can help the commandos to sneak past guards unnoticed and co-ordinate ways to take out enemies. However this can only be applied to one enemy at a time.There are 10 missions in the campaign and each is located on a large map with many objectives to complete. These range from infiltrating towns in Normandy to destroying bridges in the Pacific. Bonus missions can also be unlocked through the collection of photos. Fragments of photos can be found throughout missions and once a picture is completed a bonus mission is unlocked.CommandosDiverReal name: James Blackwood.Birthday: 3 August 1911.Birthplace: Melbourne, Australia.Can use his scuba gear to dive underwater and stay there indefinitely.
