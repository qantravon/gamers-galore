The name that was drawn was "Unpleasant Horse Racing in the Sky". The game took a few more weeks to polish, but it is essentially the same game that was birthed from that hat.GameplayThe players tap on the screen to direct their lean, mean steed. Tap on clouds to stay in the air and tap on other horses to cut off their wings and send them to their death via strategically placed meat grinders.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5310/1772089-unpleasanthorsemainimage_642x428.jpg</image></root>
