Over the course of the level, babies will randomly appear on the screen and crawl towards their ultimate demise, either in the form of electrical sockets, poisonous medicine or even the elevator shaft. The only way to serve the kids and win the game is by making your way to the babies before they die, picking them up and putting them in a cot to save them.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/2108023-__mad_nurse_c64__.jpg</image></root>
