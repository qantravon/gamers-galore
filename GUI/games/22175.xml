This allows the player to capture up to 10 enemy fighters to use against the other foes. There are three modes: modern, basic, and classic; the modes roughly correspond to difficulty levels (easy-hard). Upon completing a wave a layer is added to the tower behind the gameplay, which indicates what level the player is on. The difficulty increases exponentially until the player is out of lives.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="43061">ProjectL</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8079/313741-titanion_ttn_1l.gif</image></root>
