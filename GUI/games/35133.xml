<root><id>35133</id><name>Golf: Japan Course</name><description>OverviewThe first of two functionally similar golf games for the Famicom Disk System which together comprise an official sequel to the original NES Golf, one of Nintendo's highest selling first-party games. This particular version focuses on famous Japanese golf courses, whereas its partner product Golf: US Course focuses more on famous American golf courses. Besides the inclusion of music and a graphical overhaul, the game is more or less the same as the original Golf. The game is sometimes referred to as "Famicom Golf: Japan Course" and features Mario as the player character, as was the case in the original Golf, though the identity of this particular game's Mario is far less ambiguous as he is dressed in his trademark overalls and cap. The CPU/2nd player is a version of Mario dressed in black and orange.Though Nintendo is credited as the developer, HAL Laboratory did most of the development work.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22096">Golf</game><game id="3109">Golf</game><game id="21797">Golf</game><game id="6799">PGA Tour Golf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364876-fds_famicomgolfjapancourse_2_jp.jpg</image></root>
