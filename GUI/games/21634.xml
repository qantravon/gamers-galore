Using his new gelatin form, Jerry must return to stop his brother from marrying his bride in his stead and find a way to turn back to normal.The player, as Jerry, can use his amorphous form to attack enemies and traverse the stages. Jerry can stick to walls to an extent as well as stretch out his body to fit through narrow openings and attack. He can also collect and throw items he finds across the stage, such as balls.The US version of the game removed all the story elements, including everything to do with Jerry, Tom and Emi. Smart Ball had a planned sequel, but it was cancelled during development. The game is not to be mistaken for the SNES game Jelly Boy from Probe Software.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6657">Blue's Journey</game><game id="16751">Within a Deep Forest</game><game id="36298">Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack</game><game id="17602">Gish</game><game id="6587">Putty Squad</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8113/216004-smart_ball.jpg</image></root>
