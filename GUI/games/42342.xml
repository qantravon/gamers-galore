<root><id>42342</id><name>SimCity (2013)</name><description>SimCity is a city-building and urban planning simulation video game developed by Maxis, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it's the first major installment in the SimCity series since the release of SimCity 4 a decade prior. An OS X version is scheduled for release during Q1/Q2 2013.

The game is considered to be a reboot of the SimCity series.Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for commercial, industrial, or residential development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. SimCity utilizes a new engine called GlassBox, allowing for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, SimCity received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game's use of a persistent internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources.</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre><genre>Life Simulation</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/15967-1.png</image></root>
