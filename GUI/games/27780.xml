The game puts the player in the shoes of either a male or female customisable high school student. After undergoing some personal questions, the game assigns you to a certain social clique, either nerds, jocks, preps or rebels.  You are then placed among twenty other students at Brooktown High, who have their own social circles and personalities that the player will have to interact with to become part of the different cliques. To do this various mini-games are available that relate to the different cliques, for example mini-games awarding smart points will increase your standing with the nerd clique, and ones awarding sport points will help with the jocks clique.   The principle aim of the game is to get a boyfriend or girlfriend, this can be helped by carrying out favours for one of your peers, who in return will give you someone's phone number. When you have found a date you will be able to take them to such places as the beach, the movies or the mall. </description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1103394-brooktown.jpg</image></root>
