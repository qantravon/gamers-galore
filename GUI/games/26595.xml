You will travel through eight levels throughout the city, in locations that range from subways to the docks. At the end of every stage is a fight with a boss character, many of whom happen to be knockoffs of famous horror movie antagonists like Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees. Scoring is handled by a system wherein you simply get a point for every enemy you kill. Occasionally examples of cartoon physics pop up, such as when your character gets squashed flat by a moving steamroller or a falling billboard.A sequel, known as Crime Fighters 2 in Japan was released in the U.S. as Vendetta.</description><genres><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="14608">Final Fight 2</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game><game id="4816">Double Dragon II: The Revenge</game><game id="12741">Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game><game id="18122">Streets of Rage 2</game><game id="15924">Streets of Rage 3</game><game id="35295">Vendetta</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6182/1034402-crimefighters.jpg</image></root>
