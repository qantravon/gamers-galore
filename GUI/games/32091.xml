It was released on July 6th, 2010 for $0.99 and has received much acclaim for its purportedly control system that is superior to similar games such as N.O.V.A. The game is a generic first-person shooter that features multiplayer only gameplay in the form of 5-on-5 deathmatches.   Gameplay Archetype is a basic Quake-style deathmatch shooter that involves 10 players with 6 different weapons: Battle Rifle, Precision Rifle, Rapid-Fire AutoMag, Shotgun, Missile Launcher and Melee Axe. Players compete in a team deathmatch mode and destroy each other using an auto-aim system that allows the player to merely control movement and firing.   The game also features a persistent leveling system that allows players to achieve new ranks along with in-depth stat tracking that involves achievements as well as wins and losses.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29510">N.O.V.A.</game><game id="6215">Metroid Prime: Hunters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1439439-archetype_screenshot15.png</image></root>
