This allows changes in the lake's environment to be accurately reflected throughout the lake. It also creates lake features building them into the overall model. This model is updated from second to second, giving a realistic, ever changing environment for the fish to inhabit.Both your character's performance and tackle are taken into account to give a realistic fishing experience. Remember that the better the quality of the tackle, the better it will work.`Taken straight out of the Genesis manual`</description><genres><genre id="27">Fishing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33061">Bass Masters Classic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371921-genesis_basstournament96.jpg</image></root>
