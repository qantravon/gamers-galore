<root><id>11723</id><name>Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation</name><description>Overview  Rockman.EXE 4.5 is a spin-off of the                          Mega Man Battle Network series. It is a simulation game where NetNavis are controlled by the AI, with the players "slotting-in" BattleChips and issuing commands. It was made to be used with the BattleChip toys and BattleChip Gate accessory, which was almost certainly the cause of the title's Japan-exclusivity. The accessories are not required, but without them the game becomes much more difficult.  Playable NavisThe game features MegaMan.EXE, the twelve Navis that contribute DoubleSouls in   Mega Man Battle Network 4, and other miscellaneous Navis. Several of the Navis in the latter category would later become playable in                         Battle Network 5 and                       6. On the PET screen, the background music is a remix of the chosen Navi's                      Classic series stage theme (if applicable).  Available at the start:                     MegaMan.EXE                   Roll.EXE                  GutsMan.EXE                 NumberMan.EXE Can be unlocked from normal gameplay:                 FireMan.EXEWindMan.EXE               SearchMan.EXEThunderMan.EXE              AquaMan.EXE             MetalMan.EXE            WoodMan.EXE           ProtoMan.EXEJunkMan.EXE Requires Battle Chip Gate with proper NaviChip:           IceMan.EXE         ElecMan.EXE        ShadowMan.EXE       NapalmMan.EXE      KnightMan.EXE     PlantMan.EXEStarMan.EXE    Bass.EXE</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/956355-front_cover.jpg</image></root>
