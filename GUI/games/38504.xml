<root><id>38504</id><name>Red Rogue</name><description>OverviewRed Rogue is a simple roguelike platformer featuring actual graphics rather than the old-school ASCII art often found in the genre. The game features a pause menu from where you can quickly navigate through your inventory, your map, go to the game's options, etc, etc just by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The game is still under development, but you can already play the current stable build (see "links" below). According to Aaron Steed, the game's sole developer, the finished game will feature 20 randomly generated levels, 20 races, 20 different weapons, 20 sets of armour and 20 spells.StoryEven though the story of Red Rogue is not at all clear during your playthroughs, the developer has written a context for it:You are Red, the widow of the hero from the original game of Rogue. Your dead husband has broke his way out of the Underworld and has lead you to the Chaos Dungeon to restore him from his undead status. Find the Balrog who killed him and take back the amulet of Yendor - it is your only hope of restoring your husband back to life.Linkshttp://redrogue.net/Rogue BasinPlay the game for free here</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22309">Rogue</game><game id="24999">Spelunky</game><game id="18358">Hack</game><game id="140">NetHack</game><game id="37679">ADOM II</game><game id="35930">Tales of Maj'Eyal</game><game id="30676">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</game><game id="24453">Elona - Eternal League of Nefia</game><game id="40569">TowerClimb</game><game id="41639">Super House of Dead Ninjas</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62890/2224268-redrogue_01.png</image></root>
