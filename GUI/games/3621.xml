It is notable that Insurrection was a Blizzard-endorsed product at the time of its release, but was not developed by them. Instead, the development was outsourced toÂ  Aztech New Media. On both the commercial and critical fronts, Insurrection was much less successful than the original game. Although it provided new content in the form of additional maps for both single and mutiplayer, it didn't contain any new units, as per the conventions of expansion packs for RTS games. As a result, the game was poorly received by reviewers and also sold few copies in retail.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20660">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</game><game id="18072">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</game><game id="5550">Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri's Revenge</game><game id="21175">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II</game><game id="2115">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</game><game id="10883">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm</game><game id="19335">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Winter Assault</game><game id="5681">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade</game><game id="14073">Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1450549-e0020597_4927fa23831f8.jpg</image></root>
