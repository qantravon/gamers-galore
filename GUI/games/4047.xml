These parts posses different attributes that enhance certain areas such as movement speed and attack strength. You may equip these parts at any time, but each require a set amount of nutrients that are found in certain foods. </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27575">L.O.L.: Lack of Love</game><game id="3397">E.
