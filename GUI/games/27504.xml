<root><id>27504</id><name>RockinRoll</name><description>RockinRoll is a physics-based puzzle game. There are three portals at the top of the screen from which rocks pour out. The player must manipulate the rocks by rotating the phone. When three or more rocks of the same color touch, they are removed from the playing field and points are awarded. If any rock touches an open portal, the game ends. Giant Bomb's own Vinny Caravella created color-blind-friendly textures for use in RockinRoll.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20567">Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</game><game id="33019">Bejeweled 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1090826-shot1.jpg</image></root>
