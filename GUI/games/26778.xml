He must work to escape the belly of the beast to continue his quest for Le Esponga Grande, a magical sponge that will cure the "Pox". The game introduces Pirate Face-Off as a way of "fighting". The contestants must in turn make their most intimidating pirate faces, and whoever can make the most original pirate face wins.  PC Requirements Operating System: Microsoft® Windows® XP/Vista/Windows 7Processor: 2.0 Ghz or better (3 GHz Pentium® 4 or equivalent recommended)Memory: 512 MB RAM (1GB recommended)Hard Disk Space: 310 MBVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX® 8.1 compliant video card (128 MB recommended)Sound Card: DirectX® 8.1 sound deviceDirectX® Version: DirectX® Version 9.0c or better (DirectX updater included)Controller Support: Yes    No internet connection required to play         </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10832">Sam &amp; Max Episode 1: Culture Shock</game><game id="29474">Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse</game><game id="30008">Sam &amp; Max Episode 301: The Penal Zone</game><game id="30370">Sam &amp; Max Episode 302: The Tomb of Sammun-Mak</game><game id="4889">Rent-a-Hero</game><game id="30373">Sam &amp; Max Episode 304: Beyond the Alley of the Dolls</game><game id="6049">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</game><game id="30372">Sam &amp; Max Episode 303: They Stole Max's Brain</game><game id="21670">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 1: Fright of the Bumblebees</game><game id="25467">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 2: The Last Resort</game><game id="25469">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 4: The Bogey Man</game><game id="25468">Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures Episode 3: Muzzled</game><game id="30374">Sam &amp; Max Episode 305: The City That Dares Not Sleep</game><game id="7344">Sam &amp; Max Episode 5: Reality 2.0</game><game id="32592">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 1: It's About Time</game><game id="33414">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 2: Get Tannen!</game><game id="33415">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 3: Citizen Brown</game><game id="33416">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 4: Double Visions</game><game id="33417">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 5: OUTATIME</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8169/1153855-mlogo.jpg</image></root>
