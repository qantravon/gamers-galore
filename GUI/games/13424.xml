<root><id>13424</id><name>Cheesy Invaders</name><description>Like Space Invaders, the game involves repelling a group of strange aliens attacking Earth. The game plays almost identically to Space Invaders, but has differently themed enemies on each level; planets, mac and cheese and TV adjusters. The ship is moved left and right by using the mouse and firing is controlled using the mouse button. Unlike in Space Invaders sound effects are not very commonly played in the game and sound effects are more bizarre and only played on occasions such as when a spaceship flies across the top of the screen or when a life is lost. The game is currently being freely distributed online.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1157">Centipede</game><game id="2445">Galaxian</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="15784">Galaga</game><game id="9694">Megamania</game><game id="2773">Millipede</game><game id="14030">Demons to Diamonds</game><game id="15941">Demon Attack</game><game id="16120">Space Armada</game><game id="13036">Gorf</game><game id="14539">Astro Warrior</game><game id="12834">Alien Invaders - Plus!</game><game id="21465">Retro Game Challenge</game><game id="13292">Wavy Navy</game><game id="20713">Computer Space</game><game id="9619">TI Invaders</game><game id="23097">Lunar Rescue</game><game id="23221">Phoenix</game><game id="8975">Pleiads</game><game id="12744">Chicken Invaders</game><game id="14153">Juno First</game><game id="23504">Vector Vaders</game><game id="1750">Pepsi Invaders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5768/602131-cheesy.jpg</image></root>
