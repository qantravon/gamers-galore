The game was fairly unique at the time, as players had to earn special moves instead of being able to use them right off the batSummary from the ManualEvery four years the Dali Llama travels the world in search of the greatest warriors. He judges not only on martial art prowess but how far they truly possess the "Warrior Spirit"- inviting them all to his peaceful island where they compete to see who is worthy to wear the belt of heaven.CharactersKung Fu Bunny - Relaxed Paw Kung FuPrince Leon of Kenya - Tan Ku (The Iron Rage) Rhei Rat - Thai Boxing Tai Cheetah - Tai Chi Chuan Kendo Coyote - Kenjutsu Foxy Roxy - Penjat Silat Ivan the Bear - Soviet Military Style Fighting Panthra - Cultist Style Fighting Karate Croc - Bar Brawler Dalai Llama - Current Title Holder, General Badass </description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1898">Heavy Nova</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/1025951-085.jpg</image></root>
