<root><id>39278</id><name>Super Strike Eagle</name><description>You pilot the titular F-15 Strike Eagle, like in the other games in the franchise, but instead of using polygonal 3D graphics like the PC games, the game uses 3 different perspectives depending on mission and enemies, utilizing the strengths of the SNES hardware in regards of 2D graphics.When you take off you start in a third person Mode 7 mode, it then switches to an RPG style overhead world map, where you move the plane between objectives and encounter enemy jets and avoid missiles along the way. When you encounter enemy planes the game switches briefly to a first person cockpit mode, where enemy planes are depicted as sprites. When you arrive at targets, it switches to an overhead bombing mode, using Mode 7's scaling and rotation abilities to it's fullest.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3747">Ace Combat Advance</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
