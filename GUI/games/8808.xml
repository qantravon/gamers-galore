Learning from his past mistakes, Hitler has expanded his subterranean command bunker beneath the chancellery in Berlin so that he can keep the Spear of Destiny nearby and well-guarded!Calling upon the dark forces of the occult, Hitler can see into the future and obtain the plans to future weapon systems!(Taken from the back of the game box)It's Blazkowicz's job to retrieve the Spear of Destiny yet again, and make sure the Allies keep it this time.GameplayGameplay in Ultimate Challenge is largely the same as it was in the expansion before it, Return to Danger. Levels consist of large amounts of enemies crammed into rooms that you must clear out in order to proceed. The same goes for the way the game handles finding the exits and keys. Both are hidden, making just running for the exit not and option. Instead making the player check all the walls for hidden push walls that may hold a key or an exit.The new visuals also follow over into this expansion as well, with an exception for only a couple of textures. The newly textured guns, enemies, wall textures, and the brand new bosses, and one new enemy are all present in this game as well.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21912">Planetside: Core Combat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/24785/2281086-untitled.jpg</image></root>
