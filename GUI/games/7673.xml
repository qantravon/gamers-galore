There are also several other new 3D features; splitter blocks, which split a line of lemmings left or right; different cameras which can be used to view levels from different angles; and the ability to see things through the eyes of the lemmings themselves in first-person.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7115">Eets: Chowdown</game><game id="8669">Exit</game><game id="23189">Exit 2</game><game id="24884">Rolando</game><game id="31798">Swarm</game><game id="33376">RUSH</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2179487-box_l3d.png</image></root>
