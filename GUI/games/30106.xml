The game went under different names in various territories, known as Street Slam in Europe, Dunk Dream in Japan and Street Hoop in North America.  The player would choose from a list of 10 teams and then play in a tournament of 3 on 3 street basketball. The real change from the basketball formula was the "Super Dunk" meter. When this meter filled, the player would be able to jump 30 feet in the air and dunk the ball.  There was also some slight changes between the North America version and the other versions. In the European and Japanese versions, the player would choose from a list of different countries when selecting their team. While in the North American version, the player would choose from various United States cities. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24889">Capcom Sports Club</game><game id="35977">Back Street Soccer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/1361467-strhp_front.jpg</image></root>
