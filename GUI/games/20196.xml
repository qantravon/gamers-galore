<root><id>20196</id><name>Gravitar</name><description>Gravitar had vector-based graphics when it was released in the arcade in 1982 from   Atari Inc. For the 1983  Atari 2600 port, it had the normal pixel graphics known for the system. The 1983 home release was unique in that it was only available via mail order from the Atari Club, and thus is very rare to find. In 1988, Atari Corp. rereleased the game in their red box style, and that version is much easier to find today. The Joystick Controller is used for gameplay.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11845">Oids</game><game id="23996">Gravitron 2</game><game id="6428">Space Taxi</game><game id="26101">PixelJunk Shooter</game><game id="20269">Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship</game><game id="27255">Gravity Crash</game><game id="31341">PixelJunk Shooter 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/623296-b_gravitar_silver_front.jpg</image></root>
