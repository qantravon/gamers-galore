The game is essentially a Mega Man clone that lives in infamy due to its ridiculous english translations. While other games before have suffered from the phenomenon known as Engrish, Jaleco took the concept to new heights by engulfing the game with Valleyspeak (i.e. surfer lingo). Whether or not this translation was acceptable by 1991 standards is debatable; still, while other games may be remembered for their epic boss fights or innovative game mechanics, Totally Rad will likely be remembered as the game that gave us such classic lines as, "It's totally righteous seeing you here, professor."PlotLikeâ€¦ Whoa.Jake is a totally rad skater dude who's got this thing for this righteous babe Allison, and they meet this, like, gnarly magician Zebediah who's got all kinds of magic powers and stuff. So, Zebediah gives Jake all these magic powers right before Allison is kidnapped. So like, the totally rad thing to do would be to save her, right? Of course it would be, dude! So that's what Jake does; he totally uses his magic powers to, like, save the girl and stuff. Only that's not all. The evil dude that took Allison was named Edogy, and he wants to take over the world but is going to start with California first. He thinks the best way to do that is to, like, kidnap Allison's dad who's a bitchin' scientist. The best way to get the dad is to kidnap the girl; you get it so far? So not only does Jake have to save Allison, he's got to save her dad and the world. Whoa!StagesGet Ready, Dude!There are a total of five radical stages, each broken into smaller, slightly less radical levels.
