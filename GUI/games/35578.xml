It is the ninth game in the Mario Party franchise, the twelfth overall and the second for the Wii console. In this game, players can now play together on a car while roaming around the board. The game also has new boss battles, new minigames, and all new boards.Gameplay:Wario gets dragged home after another wild night of Mario Partying.Like previous Mario Party games players move around the table top style game board by taking turns rolling a dice. The big difference from previous games in the series is that players do not move around individually on the board, but instead move around collectively in a car. This car takes all of the players down a linear path, instead of around a large cyclical board. At the end of every board is a boss battle, which essentially takes the form of a slightly longer minigame.Instead of using coins to buy stars, this is the first Mario Party game where every player earns "mini-stars." These are a currency that is used to buy everything during games. Winning will earn you "Party Points," which allow you to unlock stuff in the game's Museum.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31210">Wii Party</game><game id="20520">Hail to the Chimp</game><game id="404">Disney's Party</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2129493-box_mparty9.png</image></root>
