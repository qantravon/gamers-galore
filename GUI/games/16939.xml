<root><id>16939</id><name>International Karate +</name><description>OverviewCreated by British developer Archer Maclean, International Karate + built on the formula established by International Karate, its prequel. The numerous improvements included the adding of a third fighter on screen. Only two of these three could be controlled and each fighter only differed in the colour of their overalls. The game was fought over rounds, presented in a 2D fighting arena with a Japanese feel.Characters are controlled with a keyboard or joystick, through a combination of direction and a single button press in a manner similar to modern day equivalents. The original soundtrack was composed by Rob Hubbard.Whilst a fondly remembered fighting game per se, it is perhaps best known for the british humour laced through-out. Examples included in the Amiga and Atari ST versions were pressing "T" to make all the trousers of the fighters fall down. The typing of other key words would cause a sunset or a bird to fly by. Typing a swear word of common parlance would illicit an on screen warning to desist, persisting to type curse words would cause the game to reset to its title screen.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7250">Karate Champ</game><game id="14669">Virtua Fighter Animation</game><game id="14586">The Way of the Exploding Fist</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="9847">Rise of the Robots</game><game id="15555">Rise of the Robots: The Director's Cut</game><game id="421">International Karate 2000</game><game id="4747">World Karate Championship</game><game id="8325">Mortal Kombat Advance</game><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/21226/718681-ikplus.jpg</image></root>
