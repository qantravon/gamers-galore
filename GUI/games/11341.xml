It’s one of those games that can be absolutely frustrating, but once you finally figure out that key thing needed in order to progress it can be positively rewarding. This isn’t necessarily for the casual gamer though, you need a strong logical brain to complete some of the perplexing challenges placed before you. This game also adds elements of comedy which at times can bring a wry smile to even the stoniest of faces. The games were recently restored and made available to download on the PC through Vulcan Software Limited's website.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9527">Flight of the Amazon Queen</game><game id="5729">The Curse of Monkey Island</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5000/537543-valhalla.jpg</image></root>
