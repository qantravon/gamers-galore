The game is, for the most part, stripped down and true to its original. There are only few cars, and few tracks. The game also features a free-roam mode, but players have been complaining that there is nothing to do while free-roaming (similar to Need For Speed: Undercover)</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11260">OutRun</game><game id="10050">OutRun 2</game><game id="2324">Ridge Racer 6</game><game id="1101">Ridge Racer 7</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/495/605353-gti_logo_jpg.jpg</image></root>
