<root><id>20936</id><name>Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli</name><description>At its heart Ferrari Challenge is a racing sim akin to the likes of Forza or Gran Turismo, but unlike those sims the only cars you can drive are Ferraris. The game features 32 fully modeled Ferraris ranging from the F430 Challenge to the classic Testa Rossa. Cars have setting that can be adjusted like camber, toe-in, and tire pressure before they head out for the big race. Cars can also be customized with a livery editor that is pretty much ripped from Forza 2, so cars can have all sorts of awesome paintjobs ranging from realistic Le Mans liverys to Solid Snakes head if you want. There are 14 tracks in the game, with most of them being liscened, like the UK's Silverstone and Canada's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. The game also adds thing like weather features that affect your car's ability to handle properly.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="26501">Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano</game><game id="21790">Gran Turismo 5</game><game id="285">F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa</game><game id="25913">Ski-Doo Snowmobile Challenge</game><game id="32206">Supercar Challenge</game><game id="37181">Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/175967-55555.jpg</image></root>
