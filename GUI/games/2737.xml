Glamour Life Stuff was the second such content addition to be released, and includes a number of decorations, floor and wall textures, and fancy clothing options for sims who want to show off their sense of high culture and sophistication.  Two new premade, vacant homes are also added to the lot bin where players can manually import them into an existing neighborhood.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24298">Spore: Creepy and Cute</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20737/762283-the_sims_2_glamour_stuff.jpg</image></root>
