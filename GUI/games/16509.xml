<root><id>16509</id><name>Total Drivin</name><description>Total Drivin is an arcade style racing game developed by Eutechnyx and published in Europe by Ocean.It features five different car classes: 4x4 Buggies, Dakar Rally Class, Sports Class, Indy Cars and Rally Class. Additionally, there are six racing locations; Moscow, Scotland, Easter Island, Hong King, Egypt and Switzerland. In total, these five classes and six locations allowed the option of 36 different races for players to complete. The game also allowed for split-screen competition with another player on any of the "cross-world tracks".When selecting a race, players were prompted to choose which car they would like to use, from a selection of eight nationality based teams. The teams liveries would often contain country relevant colours (for example, the American team Morgen would use the colours blue  white with red trim, while the Egyptian Ahmed team would use red with a splash of white) as well as culturally specific names (Rossi for the Italian team or Lumiere for the French based team).</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5589/864655-total_drivin_cover.jpg</image></root>
