The game did not receive a release outside of Japan.Like many shoot 'em ups of the era, Acrobat Mission employs a power-up system that regresses to the basic weapon if the player loses too many lives. The Wave and Hurricane shots are more powerful than the Standard shot, but require a little more finesse to use effectively. The player can also use bombs, their intensely hot engine wake and even the imminent destruction of their own ship (once taking a hit) as offensive options as well.The Super Famicom version drops the Arcade version's 2-player mode and made a few graphical and sound changes. It also removes the original ending animation and switches it for a epilogue screen of scrolling text.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14032">Imperium</game><game id="2032">Aero Fighters</game><game id="3838">Space Megaforce</game><game id="30347">Raiden Trad</game><game id="1487">Xevious</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2343304-acrobat_mission.jpg</image></root>
