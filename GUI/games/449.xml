<root><id>449</id><name>The King of Fighters 2001</name><description>Overview The King of Fighters 2001 is a 2D fighting game developed by former                                 SNK employees and published by                                Eolith for the                               Neo Geo. It is the eighth installment in the King of Fighters series and is the first King of Fighters game produced after the financial bankruptcy of the original SNK. The game concludes the "NESTS Saga" of the story, as the NESTS Organization hosts another King of Fighters tournament. The game adds new gameplay mechanics, such as Critical Wire and Counter Wire techniques which bounce enemies off the side of the screen for                              juggling, and a new dynamic team system, in which players select which of the four fighters in the team will be playable (and which will be strikers).  The team roster is heavily modified from the previous installment.                             Vanessa,                            Ramon, and                           Seth of the Hero teams now join                          Iori Yagami in the Iori team.                         Goro Daimon re-joins                        Kyo Kusanagi and                       Benimaru Nikaido as the Japan Team (along with                      Shingo Yabuki). The new Hero team, alongside main protagonists                     K' and                    Maxima, include the mysterious                   Whip and the assassin                  Lin. A new rival team, dubbed the NESTS team, consists of former mid-boss                 Kula Diamond, the angry Kyo clone                K9999, his ditzy companion               Angel, and Kula's guardian,              Foxy.      Heidern return sto the fighting scene, while   Kasumi Todoh is replaced by  Li Xiangfei and           Jhun Hoon is replaced by the new          May Lee, a student of         Kim Kaphwan.
