But it is not only a bunch of new missions, it's almost a complete new game! It contains 14 new levels, one new player character, 4 new weapons, 5 new force powers, more enemies and multiplayer enhancements. A great new feature is the improved 3D graphics engine, which now is able to display coloured light via 3D acceleration. The music is still the same original Star Wars soundtrack.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10122-1.jpg</image></root>
