Duck II</name><description>Plot D.Duck arrives at his and his girlfriend Dasy's house with the intention of enjoying porridge with his nevus (spelling intended), grandma,  Dasy, and himself and then proposing to Dasy. Before he can get in the house, his morbidly obese uncle Jubalon comes over and takes over the house by eating everything out of the fridge, staying glued to the TV, and refusing/being physically unable to move out of the house after sitting down (his body is melded to the chair he sits on due to his obesity). Dasy runs to D.Duck's cousin Anton's house and refuses to return until he can get his uncle out of the house. To make matters worse, D.Duck accidentally lets his mentally unstable nevus loose from their bolted room and needs to place them back in their cage as well.Miscellaneous The game can be downloaded legally at    Bjornarb.comTrailer can be seen at    Youtube.comThe game was made with theÂ     Adventure Game Studio engine.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11852">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</game><game id="7088">Toonstruck</game><game id="1536">Bored of the Rings</game><game id="6113">Cirque de Zale</game><game id="15838">Out of Order</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17172/804544-covsmall.png</image></root>
