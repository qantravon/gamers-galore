All the enemies in the game are Latinos, blacks, and Jews. The player has only one weapon, a machine gun, with seemingly unlimited ammo.  The game is short, consisting of three levels: a ghetto, a subway, and the "Jewish Control Center". After defeating the final boss,  Ariel Sharon, the player goes into a room where he can restart the game from the beginning or return to the main menu via standing on one of two floor tiles. The soundtrack from the game consists of skinhead punk from bands signed to Resistance Records, who specializes in white supremest music and were the developers/publishers of this game.   Graphics The graphics for the game are lacklustre and outdated, given the year of release. A black distance fog obscures most of the game, notably during the ghetto sequence, and the character models are crude and ugly.  Controversy Inevitably there was criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, who lobbied the developers of the Genesis 3D engine, which the game was made, to convince them to keep their, and other, game engines away from racist groups. However, this was inexplicably unsuccessful, and the developers allowed this title to be published.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="44396">Special Force 2: Tale of the Truthful Pledge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58235/1224197-ethnic.jpg</image></root>
