The games time period is shortly before the Battle of Thermopylae. You play as King Leonidus, the protagonist from the movie. Your fight is to defeat the Persians using various hack and slash techniques.GameplayGameplay is your standard hack n slash fare. The game tries to break up this monotony by including Phalanx  Formation, a concept developed in the movie, in which you and your soldiers form an impenetrable wall of shield and spear. Throughout the game you level up your different attributes and eventually gain the ability to dual wield swords.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11314">God of War II</game><game id="18951">Spartan: Total Warrior</game><game id="6959">God of War</game><game id="20592">God of War: Chains of Olympus</game><game id="21847">Watchmen: The End is Nigh</game><game id="20922">Afro Samurai</game><game id="26913">Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2</game><game id="31180">God of War: Ghost of Sparta</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285611-box_300mtg.png</image></root>
