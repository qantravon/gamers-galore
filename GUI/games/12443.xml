In Donkey Kong Country 3, Diddy and Donkey had set out in a quest for the Lost World when they were kidnapped by KAOS -- this time around, it's a contest to see who can discover the lost world first. A new "Lost World", that is, not just Krematoa like in DKC3.Donkey Kong Land III features the same standard stuff you'd expect from a title in the franchise, most of which will be very familiar if you've played Donkey Kong Country 3 first. DK coins can be collected by defeating Koin, an armoured Kremling, in each level. Bonus Coins can be found after discovering a hidden bonus barrel within a level and completing its challenge successfully. Bear coins can be collected and saved up before being taken to the sheepy shop of each stage, where you'll be able to meet up with one of the brothers bear. You'll also be able to collect clocks by finishing each of the bears' bonus matching games after forking over some bonus coins, which will unlock a Time Attack mode after beating the game.Game Boy Color PortOn January 28, 2000 Nintendo released a port of the game on the Game Boy Color in Japan. The Japanese Game Boy Color port was titled Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong  Dixie Kong. This version of the game featured full color support.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/782334-donkey_kong_land_iii_coverart.jpg</image></root>
