Players take control of Yellow and guide him through various sections of the MM's candy factory, breaking crates and jumping over obstacles. Yellow can defeat some enemies by jumping on them, or by using his spin attack. The game also features a number of driving levels in which Yellow takes control of a car and avoids obstacles as he drives.Shell Shocked shares a number of features with the older PC game MM's The Lost Formulas, but without the focus on math and with graphics slightly downgraded to suit the PlayStation.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/980/470402-m_ms.jpg</image></root>
