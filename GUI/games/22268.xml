<root><id>22268</id><name>WWF Rage in the Cage</name><description>OverviewWWF Rage in the Cage is an updated port of the SNES and Genesis title WWF Royal Rumble. It added steel cage matches (naturally) and FMV sequences (the first console pro wrestling game to include them). Howard Finkel does voiceover ring introductions for the participants, and audio of the wrestlers giving short promos is heard before the match begins.Somewhat strangely, the game does not include CD-quality music used for the wrestler entrance themes, it contains the same songs produced by the system's built-in audio capabilities used in the Genesis WWF games of the time.RosterBam Bam BigelowBig BossmanBret HartCrushFatuSamuCurt HenningIRSKamalaLex LugerBrian KnobbsJerry SagsRazor RamonRandy SavageRick MartelShawn MichaelsTed DiBiaseUndertakerTatankaYokozuna</description><genres><genre id="10">Wrestling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27639">WWF RAW</game><game id="10775">WWF Royal Rumble</game><game id="3826">WWF Super Wrestlemania</game><game id="28430">WWF Royal Rumble</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4544/340099-wwf_rage_in_the_cage.jpg</image></root>
