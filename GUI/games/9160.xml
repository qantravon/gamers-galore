<root><id>9160</id><name>Vegas Stakes</name><description>OverviewThe first hardcore Vegas themed video game appeared on the SNES (developed by HAL Labs) and Game Boy (developed by Dice Co. Ltd.) in late 1993 with a large amount of Vegas style gambling games, and even an RPG-style story with deep characters and stat building elements. Some consider Vegas Stakes the "mac daddy" of gambling games, and one of the stepping stones in the sub-gerne.Critical ReceptionWhen the SNES version of the game was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,8,8,8 and 7 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 7, wrote, "Like Championship Pool, Nintendo gives casino life a great video game feel -- and your adventures don't just stop in the gambling den! The incidents in the casino add much humor and great variety!".</description><genres><genre id="49">Gambling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34390">King of Casino</game><game id="28292">Kyouraku Sanyou Maruhon Parlor!
