Battles take place on either a 2-D based over head tactical map view and a zoomed in battlefield view. Players can choose to pause time to issue more precise commands, or give orders in real time. The campaign consists of over 100 objectives that historically recreate the time of Phillip II, while a satellite accurate map ensures the game is not only historically accurate but geographically as well. The game features a flushed out prisoner system, along with resource management and period accurate   naval warfare.
