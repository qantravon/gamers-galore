<root><id>19606</id><name>Thrust</name><description>Thrust is an arcade style game where you play as a space ship. Your goal was to collect a pod in each level while taking out enemy turrets that are guarding the pods and collecting fuel to stay in the air. The game was all about gravity and the weight of your ship, if you didn't take this into account, you'd fail miserably. The game was developed by Jeremy Smith and released in 1986.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11845">Oids</game><game id="1654">The Executioner</game><game id="23996">Gravitron 2</game><game id="19630">V2000</game><game id="27255">Gravity Crash</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3365/542417-a_011_006.jpg</image></root>
