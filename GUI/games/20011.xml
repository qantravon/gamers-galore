The player can also switch to commander mode, where they can assign mission objectives and troop movements themselves, and pilot any Havoc or Apache helicopters on the field.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23043">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark</game><game id="37289">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark 2</game><game id="32089">Apache: Air Assault</game><game id="1807">Apache Air Assault</game><game id="2653">LHX: Attack Chopper</game><game id="39118">Apache</game><game id="3172">Gunship!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/44753/1442801-eeah.jpg</image></root>
