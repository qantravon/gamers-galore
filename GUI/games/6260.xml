When it was released it went under the name FIFA International Soccer.The game was met with a lot of hype. It was particularly know for breaking with the 16 bit era. It used a new isometric view.Football games at the time only used a top-down view, side view, or a bird eye's view.It only included international teams, and at the time licensing was unknown of, so it doesn't use real player names.Famously, the player could run away from the referee when being given a yellow card. However, play would not resume until the referee did catch up with him and this would lead to a direct red card due to the incident.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4551">Pro Evolution Soccer 2</game><game id="7540">Pro Evolution Soccer 4</game><game id="10340">ISS Pro Evolution</game><game id="2100">Pro Evolution Soccer 5</game><game id="21612">90 Minutes: European Prime Goal</game><game id="22204">Olympic Soccer</game><game id="20959">Pro Evolution Soccer 2009</game><game id="19086">Total Club Manager 2004</game><game id="15714">Total Club Manager 2005</game><game id="25661">Capcom's Soccer Shootout</game><game id="6106">International Superstar Soccer</game><game id="5089">Michael Owen’s World League Soccer ‘99</game><game id="9790">International Superstar Soccer 64</game><game id="7106">Madden NFL '94</game><game id="31571">Crazy Soccer Mundial</game><game id="35072">LEGO Soccer Mania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370559-genesis_fifainternationalsoccer_au.jpg</image></root>
