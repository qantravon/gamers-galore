Voting took place online at covervote.nhl.com. The official cover athlete was revealed on June 20th, 2012 at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas, Nevada.It was announced at the NHL Awards that the voting had come down to forward Claude Giroux of the Philadelphia Flyers and goalie Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators. Claude Giroux was named the winner of the contest.True Performance SkatingNHL 13 is driven by real-world physics and a new skating engine. More than 1,000 new game play animations have been added to help authentically replicate the explosiveness, momentum, and top-end speed of today's NHL players.Skating has been altered as well to allow players the opportunity to switch to backwards skating with the push of a button. This will allow smoother transitions when trying to get shots off in the offensive zone.NHL 13 will also implement a "chop" feature which will allow players to hack at their opponents when they have the puck in order to gain puck possession from them.EA SPORTS Hockey IQNHL 13 features a completely overhauled A.I. and logic. NHL 13 players are now fully aware of each other on the ice. Players are smarter and quicker at making more true-to-life hockey decisions. Hockey IQ also adds a layer customization to strategies never seen before in the NHL series.Updated Trading SystemThe trading block has been revamped for NHL 13. You will now be able to specifically explain to other teams just what exactly you are looking for. In past games you only had a few options to describe what you were looking for including athleticism and defense. Teams will now look at where they are currently in the standings to see what exactly their team needs to make the next move. If a team is near the bottom, they will attempt to now sell off veterans for draft picks. However, if that team makes a run near the end of the season and gets better, the AI will now try and trade for a player that will help them rather than continue to dump off salary. Teams will continuously look at their roster throughout the season and alter what type of team they are.Searching for possible players to trade for has also received an upgrade. You can now let teams know exactly what you're looking for. For example, you can indicate that you need a sniper or scorer between a certain age range as well. The game will also search for the type of players you'd like and offer examples of possible trading partners.Improved GoaliesNHL 13 now features improved goalies.
