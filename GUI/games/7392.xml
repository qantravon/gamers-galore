The expansion, which was released in 1999, adds several new areas to the game, including the village of Ulgoth's Beard, two different islands, and the multi-tiered dungeon of Durlag's Tower. The expansion increases the experience cap from 89,000 to 161,000 and adds a multitude of new items and quests, but does not add any new recruitable player characters. The expansion has its own separate 'endgame', but must be played through before the final battle of the original game.The expansion is packaged together with the original game in the Baldur's Gate Double Pack and Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga, as well as in later multigame packages.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8890">Icewind Dale II</game><game id="17949">The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal</game><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game><game id="8121">The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon</game><game id="474">Neverwinter Nights</game><game id="9061">Neverwinter Nights 2</game><game id="13091">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</game><game id="29675">Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening</game><game id="5776">Legend of the North: Konung</game><game id="31832">Konung III: Ties of the Dynasty</game><game id="12">Blade &amp; Sword</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14741/961233-tosc_front.jpg</image></root>
