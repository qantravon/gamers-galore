<root><id>22042</id><name>Tokobot</name><description>You start out as a child called Bolt, and have a small number of Tokobots. After you go further into the game you gain more Tokobots. They turn into various formations which you control and choose depending on the puzzle. There is little combat, it is mainly focused on the puzzles to be solved using the robots in their formations.  Some of their moves are defensive, some attack, some simply guide the player across areas or help them climb.  A very linear mechanic in terms of gameplay - there is no room for real error and the next objective is often quite clear. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2665">Crush</game><game id="14147">Patapon</game><game id="24969">Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri</game><game id="21460">Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure</game><game id="15212">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1837512-box_tokobot.png</image></root>
