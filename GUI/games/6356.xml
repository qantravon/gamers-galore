<root><id>6356</id><name>The Catacomb Abyss</name><description>The Catacomb Abyss features the same player character that was in  Catacomb 3-D. Unlike  Catacomb 3-D,  The Catacomb Abyss and the subsequent two sequels were not developed by  id software.   Catacomb Abyss is the first part in a trilogy of sequels,  Catacomb Armageddon  being the second part and  Catacomb Apocalypse  is the final part. Eventually, seemingly for the purpose of making them look more like stand-alone titles, the latter two were re-released under lamer tities;  Armageddon became "Curse of the Catacombs" and  Apocalypse became "Terror of the Catacombs".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2214">Nitemare 3D</game><game id="1699">Zero Tolerance</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/90155/1622658-catacombabyss.jpg</image></root>
