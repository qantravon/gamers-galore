<root><id>16927</id><name>Gothic II: Night of the Raven</name><description>Night of the Raven integrates into the main storyline giving you a secondary quest to complete alongside the main one.People around Khorinis are disappearing and it seems the newly arrived pirates on the west coast might have something to do with it. A previously inaccessible part of the island can now be reached through an archeological dig supervised by the water-mages, a very old temple left by an ancient people that has long been lost to the ages. On the other side of the mountain you find a variety of new landscapes including a "North American"-looking desert as well as dense jungle. Old 'friend' Raven has set up shop here and a large part of the new quest consists of infiltrating his rag-tag band of criminals and rising to the top Darwin-style to have a word with the man himself...The water-mages can teach you to learn to read the script of the ancients, allowing you to learn and improve your abilities from the various writings you find scattered throughout the region.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14759">Two Worlds</game><game id="7870">Dark Earth</game><game id="10473">The Witcher</game><game id="14565">Dungeon Lords</game><game id="23081">Risen</game><game id="19907">Heretic II</game><game id="4254">Crusaders of Might and Magic</game><game id="18508">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</game><game id="10784">Arx Fatalis</game><game id="11583">SpellForce 2: Shadow Wars</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/621961-ravena.jpg</image></root>
