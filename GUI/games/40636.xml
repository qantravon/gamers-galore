This involves walking around the town and talking to various NPCs until the roller skates for each of the seven band members have been found.Hikari Genji were a seven-piece boy band from the late 80s with a string of hits around that time. They were represented by talent agency Johnny  Associates, which received a credit in the game's title screen. They are named after the protagonist of the 11th century historical novel The Tale of Genji, presumably due to that character's noteworthy good looks.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40054">Risa no Yousei Densetsu</game><game id="37810">Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</game><game id="32946">Westlife: Fan-O-Mania</game><game id="39939">No-Ri-Ko</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375220-hikari_genji_fds.jpg</image></root>
