It is the second Kirby title for the GBA and is somewhat inspired by Flagship's work on the Four Swords game included with the GBA port of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. However while Fours Swords keeps players working closely together, in The Amazing Mirror player are free to separate and conquer challenges independently. Playing without human partners results in the game AI controlling the three other Kirbys, which creates a markedly different experience. Regardless of the number of players engaged, the maze-like Mirror World holds a challenge unique to the series. Flagship would later revisit the Kirby series with Kirby: Squeak Squad on the Nintendo DS.StoryHigh in the skies above Dream Land floats the Mirror World. In this strange and beautiful land, mirrors have the power to make any wish reflected in them come true. One day, a sinister presence invaded the Mirror World, and its mirrors could only reflect bad things. When Meta Knight discovered what was happening, he set off to save the Mirror World.Meanwhile, down in the peaceful Dream Land, Kirby was enjoying a leisurely walk. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a familiar shadow appeared! It looked like Meta Knight, but something seemed different. Without warning, the shadowy Meta Knight lunged at the daydreaming Kirby!What happen next, you ask? Well, Meta Knight's sword split Kirby into four, each one a different color! Meta Knight took off into the sky, and all four Kirbys hopped onto a Warpstar to chase after him! And that's where our adventure really begins!GameplayKirby  The Amazing Mirror is unique from the rest of the series, in the way that it is structured in a way similar to Metroid where the entire game is a large explorable area in which new areas and warps can be established.There is a variety of extras hidden in chests such as maps, sound test tracks, different colors for Kirby, and additional health pieces. These chests are well hidden behind puzzles that require certian abilitys.
