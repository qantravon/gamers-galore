The game rather than using a fixed flip screen mechanism was a scrolling isometric view that kept the character under control in the center of the screen.    The four different characters had varying roles, one was the fighter, one could search out items, one could solve puzzles and the last (the dog Frozbie) could dig for items. They could either be controlled individually or made to play follow the leader if you did not want to have to move all of them to the same place.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1344855-pyracurse_gameplay.gif</image></root>
