The Devourer of Souls, long ago banished to the Void by the Wizards of Light, now breaks free of its prison. This time, there are no mages alive who can stop it.     In the small farming village of WhiteWater, you dream of an opportunity to get away from your chores for a little while. When a stranger comes to town searching for a historical relic, your quest into the nearby ruins of Mandelin quickly surpasses your expectations, drawing you deep into a world of magic and an age-old battle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15431/458286-mydar.jpg</image></root>
