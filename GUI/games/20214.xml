They must progress by changing a single letter in the starting word to create a new, valid, English word, and then changing that word, letter by letter, until they end up with the finishing word. Each puzzle has a "par" within which it must be completed, as well as a timer which is constantly ticking down. Players have a score which increases as they progress through the puzzles, but failing to meet par on a puzzle causes their score to be reduced, and running out of time in any puzzle causes the player to lose a life. Should a player lose all their lives, the game is over, however, if a player can complete a puzzle fast enough they earn a time bonus. The game also includes an expert mode in which submitting incorrect words causes the player to lose a life.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1775691-wl1.png</image></root>
