Like in previous games, you control everybody's favorite chef Peter Pepper as he tries to make the perfect burger. The game retains the formula of the original: you must jump around platforms, making a top bun fall from the top of the level to the bottom where it must land on the bottom bun. On the way, Peter must collect the burger and condiments while avoiding peppers and eggs. Unlike the original however, the levels are now in 3D and contain new obstacles such as spikes. Peter runs around on a sort of cylinder, even using jet packs to get around, in his search for the perfect burger.The game features over 50 levels including boss fights that take place around the world. The game also has a 4 player split-screen or online multiplayer mode. The game currently does not have a precise release date but is planned for release during the third quarter of 2011 on all major consoles.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2022681-box_bgwt.png</image></root>
