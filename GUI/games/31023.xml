Fortunately an undead civilization began anew, prospering until an evil force invaded the land prompting the four heroes of the story, Dem, Sara, Erik and Lita to embark on an epic quest to stop this evil from conquering the land.GameplayBreath of Death VII uses a turn based combat system very similar to traditional Japanese Role-Playing Games but with a twist: it has a combo system which allows you to build up your attacks; the higher your combo, the more powerful certain abilities will be; rewarding the player for saving their more powerful attacks until later on in battles. There are also "unite abilities" which allow two different heroes in your party to team up to perform a unique move. They can provide bonuses or deal damage depending on the characters with which you execute them. After each fight you gain experience which allows you to level your characters up with a branching leveling system, giving you choices of different attacks, spell upgrades or stat upgrades on each level allowing you make your character's stats cater to their strengths.There are also several towns to explore which feature shops, inns, houses and ghostly citizens to speak to. When outside of these towns you enter an overview of the world map in which you move your characters. The outside world is dangerous and you can be ambushed by monsters whilst you are on your way to other destinations, but going off the beaten path can provide rewards for risky adventurers.Game ReferencesThe game has several references to RPGs and other video games.
