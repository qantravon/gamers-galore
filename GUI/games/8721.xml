When attending school he becomes friends with Ritz, a tomboy who dyes her hair pink, and Mewt, a boy who gets bullied a lot. Mewt buys a mysterious old book from a used bookstore and quickly takes it to Marche’s house. He has no idea that the book has magical powers and fulfills his wish that real life was more like video games (Final Fantasy in particular). After the day is over Marche goes to bed only to wake up in the magical world of Ivalice. He then sets off in search of his friends and to find a way home.Game PlayThe main hub world serves as the majority of time spend in Tactics Advance. In this world map you'll be able to accept missions, search for random treasure, and follow the story as you move on from different areas. Missions reward you with items, gil, and exp. You can take on missions in different pubs which range from regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. Regular missions are just normal battles in different areas, encounter missions are battles against a rival clan which can also be done on the map without going to the pub. Rival clans are presented by a character icon that can freely move about. They regularly peruse your icon in the map in order to engage in combat. Dispatch missions do not involve battle, the player must pick one member from their party and send them of for a certain amount of time. Area missions are mostly dispatch missions in which Marche's clan can liberate regions. The map opens up as you complete the main story, but it's mostly up to the player and how much time they invest in visiting every area on the map.Battle SystemTatics Advance uses turned based tactical battles that take place on a three dimensional isometric field. Game play mostly remains unchanged from the first Tactics except a few changes to jobs and other minor changes. The player has full control as to how they'll attack and defend their party members. The jobs system determines what kind of attacks they'll be able to do and how powerful the attack can be. The main way to play is to anticipate as to how your opponent will react. Don't go off and attack without a defensive stance, or else you'll lose more damage than usual.Different classes offer different ways to play. Having a mix of different classes is essential to winning. Use magic and physical attacks repeatedly during battles. Don't be to predictable or else you'll lose frequently. Use the grid to your advantage and place your party in smart areas that'll both protect them and get them close enough to do damage.The Law SystemThe biggest difference between Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced is the Law System. During combat, a judge will be present on the map. The Judge is neutral during battle and will only move out of possible harm and to retrieve fallen bodies during battle. Laws are set by judges, they're basically rules that accompany different battles. They change during each match and usually forbid the use of certain weapons, items, elemental spells, or status changes. If you break a law, you'll receive a yellow card as a warning and a red card as a final verdict. Once you get a red card, you'll be imprisoned for a certain amount of time but you can pay a bail fee to get your soldier out early. Judges can also be helpful as you gain Judge Points for using combos with allies or to summon a Totema. Judge Points are gained by killing an opponent. You can also nullify laws by using antilaw cards, This can only happen after Marche rescues Ezel Berbier. You can buy them from his shop. Antilaw cards range from White Law Card which impose new laws and Black Antilaw Cards which cancels out laws that are in effect.JagdsJagds are lawless areas that are encountered later on in the game. Judges aren't allowed to participate in battles, which means that there are no laws in each match. This also means that judges can't stop people from dying during combat. If you leave one of your party members KO'd after battle, they are permanently killed and will leave your party, Main party members like Montblanc can die in Jagds as well.Main CharactersThese are the important story characters:While Final Fantasy Tactics Advance does have a lot of main characters which are central to the plot in the beginning, a lot of the characters simply don't appear after the beginning until the very end of the game. It is also worth noting that Besides Marche and Montblanc, every other main character of the children is unplayable until the very end of the game and for most not until you actually beat the main story.Marche He is the hero of the story.
