The game's subtitle is Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi.Like many adventure games of the era, the game is controlled via a series of menus that provide basic directions for the protagonist to follow, such as "go to this location" and "talk to this person".</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="4555">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2348029-jarinko_chie_fc.gif</image></root>
