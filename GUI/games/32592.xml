The first of the five episodes is due out in December 2010 for PC and Mac. The PS3 version is set to be released on February 15, 2011 with an iPad version coming at a later date.Bob Gale, co-creator, co-writer, and co-producer of the original film trilogy, has signed on to be a consultant for Back to the Future: The Game. Christopher Lloyd also returns to reprise his role as Doc Brown, while newcomer A.J. LoCascio steps in to do the voicework for Marty McFly.StoryThe story of Back to the Future: The Game begins six months after the end of the film Back to the Future Part III. It is May of 1986, and after Doc disappearing a few months earlier, Marty is upset to discover that the bank intends to sell off Doc Brown's possessions at an estate sale. Soon afterwards however, the DeLorean appears with Einstein and a shoe in it. The DeLorean was sent back by Doc as an SOS.Marty works out that the shoe belongs to Edna Strickland. Now, all Marty needs to do is find out when the DeLorean comes from. He does some investigating and figures out that Doc is in 1931 and has been accused of burning down an illegal speakeasy. He also finds out that doc is going to be shot down by the local mob.Marty travels back to 1931 and finds Doc locked up at the local prison. Doc tells Marty that he should talk to Doc's younger self who is still an up and coming scientist, running errands for his judge father. Young Doc is planning to build a rocket powered drilled, wanting it patented to finally get recognition in the eyes of his father. Marty tells him that he's part of the patent office and decides to help him to build the drill in order to free Doc. Before doing this however, young Doc must first deliver a subpoena to Arthur McFly so he can testify against local mobster Kid Tannen. To make things even more complicated, the rocket powered drill runs on alcohol, alcohol which is illegal.Arthur is working for Kid, who won't tell Marty where he is. Marty steals Kid's hat (which is actually Arthur's) and uses Einstein to find Arthur. Arthur won't come down to accept the subpoena so Marty records Kid's voice, tricking Arthur and delivering the subpoena. As for the alcohol, Marty discovers that Kid is smuggling illegal booze through a local soup kitchen. Marty meets up with a young Edna Strickland who delivers the "soup" to local charities and manages to trick her into delivering the soup to Doc's lab.Marty manages to build the drill but out of guilt reveals to young Doc that he is not from the patent office. Despite this betrayal, young Doc gives his rocket powered drill to Marty. Marty attempts to free Doc but discovers that Doc has been moved by Kid and that the timeline has changed (Doc is to be killed in a car accident). Marty catches up with Kid, frees Doc and escapes back to the DeLorean. However, just as the two are about to escape, Marty begins to disappear.To Be Continued...GameplayLike the majority of Telltale's releases, Back to the Future is an adventure game in which the player must solve puzzles and interact with characters in order to advance the plot.The game gives you direct control over Marty while clicking on an object will make him go up to the object and inspect it.
