They can also be used to cancel out of combos too (similar to Animation Canceling).Guard - Some characters will also have a guard gauge. If the player blocks attacks, this bar will slowly diminish but if drained, the player will be exposed to attacks.Big Dipper - Similar to the health bar, but as the players fight, some attacks will remove the 7 stars. Once the last star is gone, one more appears called the "Death Star" which means that they will be weak enough to execute an instant kill on them causing a "Fatal KO", regardless of how much health the opponent has.The Big DipperThe Death StarThe timer is set to 77 seconds per round and by default the play must win 2 out of 3 matches. If by the 3rd round both players have the same health or both bet a KO, a 4th round commences and if that one ends, the match ends.ControlsSimilar to most fighting games, players can walk forward and back as well crouch and jump as well as the basic blocking and crouch block. But on top of that, players can also perform other actions too:Dash Forward: → →Hop Back: ← ←Double Jump: ↑ ↑ (Can also do a two stage jump by jumping forward or back)Super Jump: ↓ ↑There are 6 buttons used for the game, which are:Punch (P)Heavy Punch (HP)Kick (K)Heavy Kick (HK)Speed Boost (S)Taunt (also adds more to the aura bar)Basic MovesThrow: → or ← + HP/ → or ← + K+HKInstant Killing Move: ↓↘→ + HP+HK (Only usable once opponent is on the last star and have Deadly Fist Blow displayed)Quick Recovery: ↑ (Once on the ground)Launcher: P+HPGuard Crush: P+K (Also removes 1 star from opponent and crumples to the floor)Guard Smack: HP+HK (Stronger version of Guard Crush which also pushes opponent to the wall)Playable CharactersKenshiroShinRaohKen-Oh (selectable by pressing Start at Raoh)JagiTokiMamiyaReiMr. HeartThouther aka SoutherJudaStagesImageName of StageCharacter that appear inLin's VillageMr Heart, KenshiroSouther CrossShinMamiya's VillageMamiya, ReiHeliportJagiJuda's CastleJudaPyramidsThoutherToki's VillageTokiHokuto RenkitozaRaoh.
