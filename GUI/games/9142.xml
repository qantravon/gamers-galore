It was the first game to use "Mouse Look" with full X and Y axis (freelook). This was next used by id Software's Quake. The game featured a "2.5D" engine. All environments, enemies and vehicles were rendered in 3D, but the game's HUD was 2D as well as in-game ammo boxes. This graphic engine may seem crude, but considering it was one of the first engines to use full polygon world and enemy modeling and in a time that was years prior to the release and popularity of 3d accellerators. The game was set in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles with the player being given the objective to destroy Skynet's headquarters to cripple the machine menace. The title also featured a somewhat difficult to control driving and flying mechanic as the player could man the classic "HK" flying hunter-killer terminator craft and drive a human resistance jeep with gun turret. Bethesda has since relinquished the use of the Terminator license, but this was the pinacle of Terminator games on the PC.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4933">The Terminator: Rampage</game><game id="20328">SkyNET</game><game id="22498">The Terminator</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5253/855737-terminator_future_shock.jpg</image></root>
