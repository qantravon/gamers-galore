As was then standard for golf games at that point, the player can select the direction of the shot and the club they wish to use, then stop a rising and falling meter to hit the ball at a desired level of power. As long as the player doesn't go out of bounds (either by hitting the ball off-course or into a water hazard), play resumes wherever the ball lands.Golf Club: Birdie Rush uses a classic top-down perspective reminiscent of the NES's first Golf game, developed by Nintendo early in the system's life, and also provides opportunities to play with a second player or in a tournament mode.</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22096">Golf</game><game id="40040">Super Birdie Rush</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2323394-golf_club_birdie_rush_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
