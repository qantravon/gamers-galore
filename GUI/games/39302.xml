Specifically, it is based on a feature-length anime with the same title. It was one of many anime licenses that Bandai used to develop Famicom games.The game plays similarly to that of Nintendo's own golf games for the system - using those games' system of tapping a button while a gauge fills for power and then tapping the button again in a "sweet spot" to perform a more accurate shot - though a major difference is in the course design: Many of the holes have unusual traps and obstacles to catch unwary players, such as cartoonish gophers on the putting green and areas set in space or on the roofs of high-rise urban buildings.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40639">Putt Putt Golf</game><game id="9316">Kirby's Dream Course</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2289891-pro_golfer_saru_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
