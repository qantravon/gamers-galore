The green and blue orbs travel in opposite rotations around the planet. The goal is to collect all the gold coins floating around the planet. Pressing the button causes your orb to jump. Once you have collected all the coins as one orb, you switch to controlling the other orb. Your previous orb will now copy every jump you made while you were controlling it. The game continues like this back and forth until you crash your orb into the other orb traveling on its previous path.AwardsCatch-22 was the winner of the Global Game Jam 2012 in Amsterdam, a finalist in the SpinAwards, and a member of The PAX 10 at PAX Prime 2012.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2266376-screen_shot_2012_07_14_at_7.38.56_pm.png</image></root>
