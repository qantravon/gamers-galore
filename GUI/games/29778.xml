Here players begin as an up-and-coming DJ who travels the road. If player is successful enough, they can eventually become the head of their own entertainment empire.   It also allows the player to compete in battles between both real DJs, and the fictional characters native to the series, in addition to the various setlists, mega-mixes, and bonus setlists that the player can compete in. Freestyle DJ Hero 2 introduces freestyle scratching and crossfading.  During these sections of the mixes the player will play through, he or she will be able to crossfade between the two tracks and/or scratch as they please.  Contextual SamplesRather than simply having canned samples appropriate for all tracks, DJ Hero 2 will also have samples available to the player that have been extracted from the songs being mashed up. For example, in the "Regulate"/"Hot in Herre" mix, a sample of                                         Warren G's voice is available. It also allows the player to compete in battles between both real DJs, and the fictional characters native to the series. Microphone Compatibility / Expanded Multiplayer DJ Hero 2 allows for vocalists to enter the fray more than ever. While the original game featured microphone support, players were only able to freestyle/talk/yell over the music. This year's rendition introduces on-screen vocals, allowing for players to sing and rap along to the lyrics.  Improved Microphone Support is just one of the ways multiplayer as been expanded In DJ Hero 2. DJ Battles return, but have unique mixes specially tuned for battle gameplay. Here, players perform alternating song sections, with the winner being the most accurate of the two. Accumulator has players racing to fill an on screen bar by getting high note streaks. Party Play (as introduced in                                                                  Guitar Hero 5) also makes a comeback, allowing players to build a custom setlist and both DJs and Vocalists to jump in or out of  song at anytime.  SoundtrackDJ Hero 2's soundtrack is once again supporting mashups of "the hottest tracks" from "the biggest artists". This year's setlist sees over 80 new mashups that include over 100 artists. Players should note that a number of mixes can only be played in the game's DJ Battle Multiplayer mode.  Produced and mixed by A-Trak Justice - "D.A.N.C.E."

These include: David Guetta    Deadmau5DJ QbertTiesto   RZA Guest DJs play a role in the game's Empire mode as players are able to recruit them to preform opening setlists once more clubs become available. These special setlists are reminiscent to the encore songs found in the      Guitar Hero series, which involve specialized introductions to the songs (for example, Deadmau5 is shown to put on his mousehead as opposed to simply walking to his turntables).  Joining the guests DJs are fictional characters created by   FreeStyleGames. Most of the fictional DJs from the previous installment return (such as Jugglernort and Mixy Trix), as well as created characters that are new to the series. Xbox 360 players may also use their Xbox Avatar as playable characters as well.BundlesDJ Hero 2 is available for purchase in two different bundles. The Party Bundle includes a copy of the game, two turntable controllers as well as a microphone. The Turntable Bundle is simply one turntable controller with a copy of the game. Players also have the choice to purchase the game separately as a standalone title.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24025">Scratch: The Ultimate DJ</game><game id="24384">beatmania</game><game id="23309">DJMAX Fever</game><game id="26656">Def Jam Rapstar</game><game id="36981">Crackin' DJ</game><game id="24517">beatmania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/1790546-dj_hero_2_cover.jpg</image></root>
