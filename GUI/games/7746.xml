Released for the Playstation 2 February 2002, the game allowed players to take controls of 22 pilots on 13 different locations. Focusing around Sebulba's tries to take revenge on Anakin Skywalker for his defeat in Episode I, the game stays true to it's formula, only making small changes such as the ability to knock other racers out.The game takes you to locations which have been only been mentioned in the films such as Mon Calamari and Sullust. There are also a few races which take place on Tatoonie with a final showdown on the Planet. Throughout the campaign you can play as any of the characters with the exception of a few unlock able racers. You upgrade a single character at a time although they stay ranked up if you restart the game with a new alien and yes Anakins Acting skills make him an alien.RacersAnakin SkywalkerOcco NinebarShrivel BraittrandMars GuoNeva KeeSebulbaAldar BeedoBen QuadrinarosDud BoltOdy MandrellTeemto PagaliesClegg HoldfastGasganoMawhonicKnire DarkKraid NemesoWan SandageScorch ZanalesTzidik WrantojoYoung Anakin SkywalkerWattoLocationsGamorrField of LegendCitadelFortress Mountain AreaTower of EyesClutter JunkyardMon CalamariOrotoru G'amHall of HeroesBallast TanksGrand ReefsRylothThe Great TusksCrater SeaSullustSerres SarranoTatooineMos EspaMos Espa Grand ArenaJabba's Palace</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13526">Star Wars: Episode I - Racer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285712-box_swrr.png</image></root>
