The player drives around the city (portrayed in top-down perspective) until a "spider" alarm goes off, depicting where an infestation is in full process. The player has basically two means of killing the spiders, the spray can on his back and the his feet on the end of his legs. He can exterminate the critters by spraying on them or simply jumping on them, splatting them flat.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11874">Ghostbusters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2522588-arachnophobia_pc.jpg</image></root>
