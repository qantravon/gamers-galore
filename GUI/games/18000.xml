Intrigue features a unique random generation system that changes the possible suspects every time you start the game anew and as such, no two games will ever be the same (unless you play the game a few thousand times). The graphics in the game are in  film-noir style and many of the characters resemble old time film stars to a degree, such as Marilyn Monroe or Humphrey Bogart. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11559">Crime Time</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1872421-intrigue____1988___mirrorsoft.jpg</image></root>
