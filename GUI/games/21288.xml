Aside from the anime-style portraits of the game's 5 characters, the game's graphics were created entirely using stock textures from the PlayStation's developer kit. Piloting flying vehicles dubbed "VEDs," which come in an assortment of shapes and sizes (Including a motorcycle, a mech suit, and a pineapple-textured bus with wings), players are meant to run laps around oversized, barren tracks.Boasting crippled controls, a variety of non-functional multiplayer modes (Including "Scramble" mode, which has players attempting to track down and capture balloons hidden within otherwise empty maps), and a general lack of consistency, the game was received poorly upon release, and Neorex would not go on to produce any new titles.CharactersThe game boasts a selection of 5 playable characters (each with their own individual VED).Characters / VEDsCyan Square - "Borg"Kenjyuro T - "HITO-01"Leo Clis Paldo - "Couga"Easha Krueq - "Propeller"Barba Kue - "S-Lagon"LegacyA decidedly obscure release, the game's lasting legacy seems to be it's dubious honor of being the only game to receive a score of "0%" from the now-defunct gaming magazine Game Player. The review was published in the publication's final issue in 1996.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4087/184339-cosmicrace_ps.jpg</image></root>
