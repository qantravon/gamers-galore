The unique aspect that distinguishes Freedom Force is the over the top humor and art style that pays homage to the Silver Age of Comic Books. The game was developed by Irrational Games and released in 2002.DevelopmentKen Levine  Irrational initially pitched the game as"Justice Squad", a tactical turn-based RPG (like X-Com) that was even closer to the Silver Age of comics. But early on in development, they noticed the waning popularity of the tactical RPG genre and switched to a hybrid real-time combat. Ken noted the Baldur's Gate series as a major inspiration for the hybrid "pause and play" combat in the final game that encouraged liberal use of the pause-in-combat feature.GameplayFreedom Force plays as a strategy / RPG game were you get to control up to 4 members of Freedom Force on several missions. Each of the heroes has various moves and superpowers that can be used in the game. As you gain more experience points from completing missions, you can unlock new powers for the characters. Unlike an action RPG game like Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Freedom Force plays more like a tactical RPG, where you get to pause the action, plan your next move, and act accordingly.Hero CreationThe hero creation feature allowed players to create their own heroes by mixing and matching many stock powers. Players could also give these heroes their own origin stories, allowing people to role play as their own creation. Years after the release, this proved be one of the most popular features of the game.PlotMinute Man  MentorLord Dominion is an alien bent on world domination, and the only thing standing between him and achieving his goal is earth. He devises a diabolical scheme of endowing the criminals of earth with a super human power inducing substance known as energy X, and watching earth crumble from within. Before he can execute his plan, one of the alien citizens from his planet (known as Mentor) steals the canisters of energy X and heads to earth in the hope of giving the power to some good citizens who can stand against Lord Dominion's oppression. On his way to earth, Mentor's ship is shot down by Lord Dominion's forces and the canisters of energy X are dispersed all throughout Patriot City.Various people -some good and some evil- are exposed to the radiations of energy X and endowed with super human powers. The good ones join forces with Mentor and decide to form a group to fight the forces of evil, and defend Patriot City from all dangers. Each one of the heroes is granted a power that matches his or her personality. For example, Frank Stiles' patriotism translates to Minute Man, the righteous hero who fights for justice, and El-Diablo is a hot headed Latino whose fiery powers match his fiery personality. Together, this group of heroes is known as the Freedom Force.PowersHero powers are either offensive or defensive, with each group then dividing itself into sub-categories.Offensive PowersOffensive
