The player progresses through parsecs (levels) while collecting treasures dropped by defeated enemies to get a high-score. There are four difficulty settings, and two gameplay modes (all options have separate high-scores). The gameplay mode determines the alternate fire mode of the player's ship. In “roll” it is a charge shot that surrounds the ship, collecting treasures. It will not damage enemies until it is fired. In “lock” mode the alternate fire is a lock on laser that helps to destroy enemies. Both alt-fire modes slow the ship's movement, aiding the player's ability to dodge shots.The enemy fire patterns are completely random, but scale to the difficulty setting. There is a mini-boss every 5 parsecs and a boss every ten. Both types of enemy have multiple targets and complex fire patterns, an idea Cho more fully explored in rRootage. After defeating a boss, the player can start from that point when beginning a new session, but she won't get the points from the previous levels.TriviaCreator of the game Everyday Shooter, Jonathan Mak, has cited Parsec 47 as the inspiration behind his game's aesthetic.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11528">Noiz2sa</game><game id="22177">Mu-Cade</game><game id="23821">rRootage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/30196/1832096-parsec.jpg</image></root>
