He is able to fling axes in an arc ala Castlevania. The player takes the protagonist through a bit of platforming, at which there are extremely pointed instructions on how to defeat the boss:There's a boss at the end of this tunnelYou can't hurt him with your weaponsTo kill him you have to burn the rope above(right-clicking any time during the game reveals a fourth instruction: "4. Also, you can't really die")At the end of the tunnel is a large, black square called the Grinning Colossus. There are two chambers, on on either side, filled with torches. The player then has to ascend one of the chambers, grab a torch, and burn the rope to drop a chandelier on the boss and win the game.After the game, the player is treated to a "Still Alive"-esque song about what has happened in the game and how short it was. Depending on how quickly the player beats the game, the song can actually be longer than the total playtime.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2408289-yhtbtr.png</image></root>
