However the game features an orb system. The player can mix and match up to 3 different colored orbs (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green). Each combination creates drastically varying shot types.Many fans of the game compare it to another Compile developed game, M.U.S.H.A. for the Sega Genesis. Both games have a similar art style, and a similar feel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7928">M.U.S.H.A.</game><game id="17903">Spriggan Mark 2</game><game id="35707">Spriggan Powered</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2157984-box.jpg</image></root>
