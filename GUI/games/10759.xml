<root><id>10759</id><name>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island</name><description>OverviewÂ You take control as Skipper in this  Bandai game from 1990. However, you're also followed around by Gilligan which is controlled by the computer. This is often the source of hate towards the game, since the AI of Gilligan was truly awful. Gilligan is constantly getting stuck, falling down holes, and basicly just act like a bafoon. Some claim he was programmed this way to live up to his clumsyness in the TV-serie.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19233">The Three Stooges (Digitally Remastered Edition)</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361760-nes_gilligansisland.jpg</image></root>
