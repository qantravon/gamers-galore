<root><id>17345</id><name>Innocent Until Caught</name><description>The players slips into the role of Jack T. Ladd a tax dodger who finds himself stranded on planet Tayte, a safe haven for all sorts of rascals and shady characters. Yet, he has only a few weeks left before the government will chase him down so he has to find a way to make money, and quick.   Innocent until caught is a game full of tongue-in-cheek humour, similar to other popular space-adventure games, such as the   Space Quest series. However, unlike the  Sierra games, this game is virtually unknown, despite decent graphics, witty dialogue and an interesting, if only a bit silly storyline.   The interface is identical to most classic point  click adventure games, including an iconographic control system and an inventory. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10915">Beneath a Steel Sky</game><game id="3961">B.A.T.</game><game id="15307">Guilty</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/721010-23305_boxshot_1.jpg</image></root>
