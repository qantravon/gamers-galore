The Wii Remote is also used in a dueling mode where you sword fight enemies in first person using the Wii Remote to match on screen prompts to block and attach. To remain invisible you can extinguish candles and lanterns with water. A cover system is provided that allows the player to cling to walls, and look around corners to spot potential enemies or threats. As seen in the Metal Gear Solid series, after downing an enemy the player has the option of picking up and moving the body to decrease the chance of being detected by other live enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12354">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</game><game id="457">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent</game><game id="5961">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</game><game id="15549">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</game><game id="21654">Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</game><game id="26400">Thief</game><game id="7787">Thief II: The Metal Age</game><game id="4523">Thief: The Dark Project</game><game id="6601">Hitman: Contracts</game><game id="11004">Hitman: Blood Money</game><game id="6709">Hitman: Codename 47</game><game id="7004">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</game><game id="20669">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</game><game id="16140">Metal Gear Solid</game><game id="12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</game><game id="18082">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</game><game id="10267">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</game><game id="8761">Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</game><game id="22928">Assassin's Creed II</game><game id="598">Shinobido: Way of the Ninja</game><game id="24155">Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja</game><game id="7345">Red Ninja: End of Honor</game><game id="38507">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</game><game id="37494">Assassin's Creed III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/34651/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg</image></root>
