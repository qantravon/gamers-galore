<root><id>2678</id><name>L5RC</name><description>L5RC was designed to make the point that fancy graphics and deep stories aren't necessary when creating fun and interesting games. Instead, this game pits the player against the clock, throwing out harder and harder sequences to match in order to achieve a high score.The gameplay includes three symbols numbered 1-3 in Easy mode and 1-9 in X-Pert mode which the player must match with the sequence provided. If one of the symbols is misidentified, the player must start the sequence over again. The game ends when the timer at the bottom of the screen runs out. The score is calculated by taking away the number of errors from the number of the sequenced reached by the player, multiplied by the number of symbols correctly identified. Easy mode reduces scores by half. For example, a player reaching the second sequence with one error, getting five symbols correct, would receive 5 points on X-Pert mode and 2 points on Easy mode.L5RC was created for fun, but when it gained popularity among friends, the creator decided to release a freeware version online. He encourages you to try to beat a score of 1,000.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/65153/2328346-l5rc_000.png</image></root>
