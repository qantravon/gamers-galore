It was only playable for one week as a public beta. It was completely rewritten and renamed to RuneScape. The map of the world has been slightly changed - left and right side are flipped.Only few screenshots of this game remain, and while it still is on one of JaGEx computers, there is no way to play it.</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4462/1484120-picture.gif.png</image></root>
