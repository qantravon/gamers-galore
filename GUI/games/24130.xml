<root><id>24130</id><name>Astro Tripper</name><description>OverviewIn each level of Astro Tripper, you can move around the arena freely. Your ship is fixed at an angle, but you can turn it around 180° with the press of a button to face either the left or the right side. There are two main weapons that can be upgraded by collecting crystals throughout the level: a blue concentrated shot and a red spread shot. The end of each level set in adventure mode ends with a boss battle. There are also challenges to unlock: you are placed in the arenas of the adventure mode, but you are faced with an never-ending stream of enemies. You fight until you die.PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS:XP,Vista,7Processor:1.6GHZ or betterMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:DirectX 9.0c compatible Shader 2DirectX®:dx90cHard Drive:75 MB HD spaceSound:DirectX 9.0c compatible</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5536">Defender</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/495/758186-title_astro.jpg</image></root>
