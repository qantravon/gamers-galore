It is played from a  side scrolling perspective with a looping area similar to that of    Defender or    Choplifter, complete with an almost identical map at the bottom of the screen as those two games had. The main gameplay twist was that you had a limited number of fuel and had to regularly refuel. Refueling left you vulnerable to attack, and if the fuel platforms have all been destroyed, then you cannot refuel and will crash.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18152">Choplifter!</game><game id="5536">Defender</game><game id="27035">Attack of the Mutant Camels</game><game id="16704">Revenge of the Mutant Camels</game><game id="9406">Save New York</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1457575-533_1.jpg</image></root>
