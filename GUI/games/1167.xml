All the characters in the game are rendered in a "super-deformed" art style that makes them appear like characters in a children's cartoon. The feel of the game is more whimsical than other games in the Virtua Fighter series as well.GameplayVirtual Fighter Kids plays like a faster version of Virtua Fighter 2. The gameplay is set up exactly the same; the only real difference between the two, besides the speed, is the art style.The Saturn version of VFK allowed players to program combos onto buttons and also had extra FMV sequences not featured in the arcade version of the game.LegacyVirtua Fighter Kids is considered an oddity among Saturn collectors and Virtua Fighter fans due to its concept and the Japanese version's constant product placement for a drink called Java Tea. The game is not very widely known outside of Virtua Fighter or Saturn fancircles.The VFK versions of Akira and Sarah are playable in the Saturn title Fighters Megamix.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19043">Fighters Megamix</game><game id="1329">Pocket Fighter</game><game id="489">ClayFighter</game><game id="3185">ClayFighter 63 1/3</game><game id="18019">ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut</game><game id="21013">Sonic the Fighters</game><game id="38140">PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale</game><game id="25850">Battle Arena Nitoshinden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2593/375798-virtuafighterkids.jpg</image></root>
