My friend Pedro Paiva and I are putting a great effort to guarantee that this game feels really like an 8 bit classic. Everything on Oniken, from the character design to the music, is a tribute to the 8-bit action games from the NES era. So if you like old-school games be prepared for Oniken and remember... Oniken is NES hard!</description><genres><genre>Platform</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17536-1.png</image></root>
