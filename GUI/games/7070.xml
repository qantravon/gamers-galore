Fever Pitch Studios was formed from former Digital Anvil employees to complete the game and release it through Ubisoft.The emphasis of CFW was fleet management and supply chains. Rather then consisting of a single map, battles took place throughout a linked chain of multiple maps or systems connected by player-created warp gates. Supplies would automatically travel through these gates to systems that were connected to the player's "home" system. Systems that lost this supply chain would cease to function until the chain of supply could be recreated.Players could choose between three playable races:Terrans - The human race, descended from Earth.Mantis - An evil Insect-like alien race.Celareons - A strange, energy-based alien race.SequelA sequel, tentatively titled Conquest 2: The Vyrium Uprising was in development at Warthog Texas (formerly Fever Pitch Studios) in 2004 for approximately one year before Warthog PLC sold all development studios to Gizmondo and development of Conquest 2 ceased in favor of Hit  Myth. Conquest 2 was to introduce a fourth race, the Vyrium, who would play a major part in the storyline.In May 2012, members of the original Fever Pitch Studios team formed a new company, Peezocker Inc., and launched a Kickstarter to fund completion of the sequel's development.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13062">StarCraft</game><game id="7756">Star Trek: Armada</game><game id="11590">Homeworld</game><game id="212">The Outforce</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1247977-conquest.jpg</image></root>
