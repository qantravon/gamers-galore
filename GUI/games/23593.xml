The game is focused on light and darkness, hence the name.The game has 30 levels for you to adventure through. GameplayYour goal in LIT is to make a lit path using diffenent lightsources from the starting point till the exit. You have a limited amount of batteries in order to do so and if you are not carefull and overuse it the fuse might blow. In LIT you encounter corrupted members of your school who serve as boss fights.Just like in No More Heroes every now and then you recieve cell phone calls through the speaker of the wii remote; however, in LIT these conversations may alter the ending. If you so desire, you may switch between a top down and a third person view. ControlsYou move around using the analogue stick on the nunchuck and use the Wiimotes IR pointer to point your slingshot. You use gestures like a throwing motion to throw cherry bombs and to recharge your batteries you shake the Wiimote.New game plusAfter you beat the game you can replay it with Rachael, increasing the difficulty.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6862">Obscure: The Aftermath</game><game id="3726">Obscure</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/878828-lit_coverart.jpg</image></root>
