The eponymous main character is able to jump and glide, but not directly attack enemies unless he is diving down fast while gliding. In order to complete each level, the player has to have Alfred peck all of the balloons that are tied down in various parts of the levels. Once all of the balloons have been pecked, a boss is fought to complete the level. For a publicity stunt to promote the game Karl Fitzhugh, an employee of Mindscape, ran for a political office as the Alfred Chicken party candidate in Christchurch, Dorset, England. Unsurprisingly, he did not win.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10299">Super Mario Bros. 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2387953-alfred_chicken_fr.png</image></root>
