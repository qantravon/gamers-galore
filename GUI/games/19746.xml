<root><id>19746</id><name>Stack-Up</name><description>The player directs Professor Hector to jump onto buttons, each of which activates an action for the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) accessory. A given sequence must be followed in order for R.O.B. to arrange the colored discs in the correct order on the 5 pedestals surrounding it. Stack-Up is considered to be a rare game, especially outside of the USA, with the discs being among the hardest to find accessories for the NES.Like the other R.O.B game Gyromite, the game uses a series of screen flashes to tell R.O.B. what you want him to do.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20055">Gyromite</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/237458-stack_up.jpg</image></root>
