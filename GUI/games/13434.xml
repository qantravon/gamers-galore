The premises are essentially identical, as the game involves shooting up asteroids without getting destroyed by shrapnel or enemy ships. It, like predecessor, used vector graphics.Gameplay Player shooting at the asteroids.As in  Asteroids, you had to destroy the asteroids floating around you. When you shot them, they would break into small asteroids. After a few shots, they are destroyed.  Added features in  Asteroids DeLuxe are a shield, instead of a teleport system, to try and evade destruction. The shield loses power as objects and lasers impact it. Another added feature is a pod of enemy robots in the shape of an asteroid. When fired at, they break up and charge at you. You destroy them as you would any of the other space ships.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22478">PowerUp Forever</game><game id="20600">Blast Factor</game><game id="20833">Shred Nebula</game><game id="22414">Atari Classics Evolved</game><game id="774">Transplant</game><game id="31356">Space Duel</game><game id="41489">PlayStation Home Arcade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1338391-astdelux.jpg</image></root>
