It is the first iPhone game from Kwalee, a new developer started by David Darling, the man behind Codemasters.Each player takes turns to place bombs on a grid. The first to connect five bombs together wins the match. iOS notifications let each player know when it is time to take their turn. This is similar to the turn-based mechanics seen in Draw Something.The gameplay is designed to be highly strategic, while reducing the time required to play a turn, making it even more accessible than other turn-based puzzle games on mobile devices. You simply drag and drop your bombs.There is also some instant messaging functionality, to allow players to send chat messages to each other during matches.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37753">Draw Something</game><game id="39197">Pussy Flip: Purrfect Reversi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1642/2166897-appstorescreen4.png</image></root>
