<root><id>8176</id><name>Starsky &amp; Hutch</name><description>GameplaySet out as if it were the television show, Starsky  Hutch takes place over 'three seasons'. Each level played essentially serves as an episode and players receive a rating based on their skill at completing each episode. This rating is called a Viewer Rating, yet another reference to Starsky  Hutch's prior incarnation as a television show.Players are advised not to hit civilians, crash into buildings or cause any negative unrest as that will lower the viewer rating. Performing certain stunts, such as driving through boxes and shooting special VR power-ups will result in the Viewer Rating remaining high. Throughout the three seasons, the players objectives are to catch criminals and occasionally escort other vehicles.Story ModeSeason 1Episode 1 - Fast CarsEpisode 2 - Special WithdrawalEpisode 3 - Bay City HeatwaveEpisode 4 - Middle ManEpisode 5 - Squealing PiggyEpisode 6 - A Little MayhemSeason 2Episode 1 - Not So Easy RiderEpisode 2 - Swann DiveEpisode 3 - Departure GatesEpisode 4 - Wheels with WheelsEpisode 5 - The Big Score Part 1Episode 6 - The Big Score Part 2Season 3Episode 1 - BreakoutEpisode 2 - Parking TicketEpisode 3 - Hot TomatoEpisode 4 - Save the SenatorEpisode 5 - Bomb SurpriseEpisode 6 - 18 Wheels of TroubleMusicThe music for the game was written by Tim Follin and features the same style of the soundtrack to the 70's show including Tom Scott's Gotcha theme, as well as trends of the 70's, the time in which the game is set.PC RequirementsWindows 98/ME/XP/2000;Pentium II 450 (Min.), Pentium IV 1.5GHz (Rec.);128MB RAM (Min.), 256MB (Rec.);DirectX 8.1 (Min.), DirectX 9 (Rec.);700MB hard drive space (Min.), 1.2GB (Rec.);Nvidia TNT2 3D card (Min.), GeForece2 3D card (Rec.).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27828">Lucky &amp; Wild</game><game id="4241">Total Overdose</game><game id="9112">Crazy Taxi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1797002-box_sah.png</image></root>
