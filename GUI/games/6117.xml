This is done by dropping and rotating blocks that consist of two "pipe pieces", which can either be straight or a bend. A pipe piece needs to have a block directly underneath it, otherwise it will fall until it is supported (meaning that blocks can split), during which time it can be rotated again. Water runs in the path created by the linking of blocks, similar to Pipe Dream.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="2779">Pipe Dream</game><game id="24031">Factory Panic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/541322-gorby_box.jpg</image></root>
