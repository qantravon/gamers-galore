They felt the fact that you were being rewarded with (near) nudity was unacceptable for a 15 rating, their highest rating. Australia currently does not have a 18 or "M" equivalent rating, which results in a lot of games not coming out in the country.</description><genres><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3515">The Guy Game</game><game id="7837">Cover Girl Strip Poker</game><game id="29520">High Stakes: Texas Hold'Em</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1097390-screen001.jpg</image></root>
