Unfortunately, the controls are nearly unplayable and the game suffers for this. Though panned universally for the gameplay, the visuals are nearly always praised for the polygons which made the tennis experience seem more real than ever before.      Launch Game Power Serve 3D Tennis was a North American launch game for the original PlayStation (PSOne) back in 1995.
