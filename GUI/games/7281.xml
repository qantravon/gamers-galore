Brimhil, the queen of the elves and eternally young, gave up her youth to revive the Life Tree and the elves along with it. 100 years later, elves are being abused by humans and a young half-elf named Francis De La Cross attempts to obtain the power of a god to restore Brimhil's youth before she dies.

It's a light, easy way to burn some time, but isn't substantial enough to sustain interest for very long".</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17905">PoPoLoCrois</game><game id="6859">The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch</game><game id="19938">The Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion</game><game id="20593">Jeanne d'Arc</game><game id="9532">Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness</game><game id="11771">Brave Story: New Traveler</game><game id="5278">The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean</game><game id="19349">Breath of Fire III</game><game id="21924">Dragoneer's Aria</game><game id="22171">Blade Dancer: Lineage of Light</game><game id="2094">Final Fantasy II</game><game id="19864">Final Fantasy Tactics</game><game id="21624">Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis</game><game id="24967">Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days</game><game id="24102">Crimson Gem Saga</game><game id="26422">Lunar: Silver Star Harmony</game><game id="8403">Final Fantasy</game><game id="27372">Narisokonai Eiyuuden: Taiyou to Tsuki no Monogatari</game><game id="27388">Valkyria Chronicles II</game><game id="24212">Growlanser</game><game id="27501">Hexyz Force</game><game id="12719">Advance Wars</game><game id="1520">Fire Emblem</game><game id="30057">Sid Meier's Civilization V</game><game id="15133">Phantom Dust</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="13062">StarCraft</game><game id="20815">Worms</game><game id="20660">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</game><game id="196">X-COM: UFO Defense</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/902160-box_l.jpg</image></root>
