The gem is what grants the player their 'mage' powers, as they explore the game's dark setting.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="10565">Strife</game><game id="29717">E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/1226615-g04980wcch3.jpg</image></root>
