You play as Richard, with the ultimate goal being to have     sexual intercourse with a girl.  Fuck Quest has supposedly received rave reviews... at least, that's according to Richard Eter's     personal website.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14802">Custer's Revenge</game><game id="18220">Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em</game><game id="4990">Leisure Suit Larry 1:  In the Land of the Lounge Lizards</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1679/764165-fuck_quest.png</image></root>
