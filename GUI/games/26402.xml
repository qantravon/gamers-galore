Jet Bike Special consists entirely of the motorcycle/robot racing     minigame from      Chrono Trigger  that takes place in  2300 A.D.  Jet Bike Special adds another mode, an "Ask   Johnny" feature, and a feature that records the player's best scores on the minigame. Jet Bike Special was developed by     Squaresoft and published by     Nintendo.GameplayReplays are stored of the top ten best runs.Jet Bike Special's gameplay is simple;     Johnny and     Crono race each other in a     Mode 7 post-apocalyptic wasteland. There are two game modes (Game Mode 1 and Game Mode 2). There are only minor differences between each mode. Game Mode 1 allows the player to boost by pressing the B button, while Game Mode 2 removes this boosting feature (theoretically making the race more difficult, and allowing the player to earn more points). Points are earned through the race by going distance without crashing into Johnny. Crashing into him from the front does grant some amount of points, but crashing into his tail end will take away points. These points are recorded into a top ten ranking overall (not one for each mode), with replays of all ten available for watching.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22786">BS Excitebike Bun Bun Mario Stadium</game><game id="22245">BS Zelda no Densetsu</game><game id="22297">BS Zelda no Densetsu: Kodai no Sekiban</game><game id="21372">BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/971967-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png</image></root>
