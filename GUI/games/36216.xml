The first Kinnikuman game (released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in the US) was a straightforward wrestling game, but this sequel changes the action to a side-scrolling action brawler game with additional RPG and story elements. The main character can still use wrestling moves on enemies, but most of the attacks are simple punches and kicks.Curiously, the boss music is a sped up version of "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="10">Wrestling</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93538/1867792-578414_18613_front.jpg</image></root>
