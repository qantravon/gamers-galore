This pun-filled game stars an anthropomorphic wise-cracking bobcat named Bubsy, as he tries to stop enemy aliens (called Woolies) from stealing Earth's supply of yarn balls.The game later spawned a series of platformers (ending with Bubsy 3D). An enhanced version for the PC, titled Super Bubsy, was released in 1995. Super Bubsy contained upscaled graphics, new sound effects, and the unsuccessful pilot episode for the Bubsy animated series.GameplayThe game plays like a traditional 2D sidescrolling platformer similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through levels, attempting to reach the end of the level (before the time runs out) while eliminating enemies, gaining score, collecting powerups, and avoiding deadly obstacles. The game includes fifteen main levels (called "chapters") split up into six main areas (ranging from forests to the Wild West) and one final level (set in space).Bubsy has two abilities at his disposal: jumping (by pressing the Jump button) and gliding (by pressing the Glide button). Gliding reduces his downward falling speed, and activating it at the right time before bouncing up allows Bubsy to be propelled much higher than usual.Running into enemies, touching deadly obstacles (such as water, spiked pits), and fall damage can kill Bubsy in one hit (as he has no health system whatsoever). However, jumping or gliding onto enemies can eliminate them (getting them out of Bubsy's way while giving the player score). Due to the difficulty, there are plenty of checkpoints (for Bubsy to respawn at) and extra lives (as if starting with nine lives, like the cat mythology, is easy enough) scattered around levels.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="17584">Awesome Possum Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt!</game><game id="1334">Super Mario World</game><game id="14327">Vectorman</game><game id="5374">Fester's Quest</game><game id="5834">Bubsy In: Fractured Furry Tales</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="2350">Zool 2</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="397">James Pond 2: Codename: RoboCod</game><game id="5694">James Pond 3: Operation Starfish</game><game id="9716">Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure</game><game id="4182">Plok</game><game id="22845">I Wanna Be The Guy</game><game id="13382">Fire &amp; Ice</game><game id="11746">Cool Spot</game><game id="468">TinHead</game><game id="27050">Frantic Flea</game><game id="24993">Prehistorik Man</game><game id="11841">Garfield: Caught in the Act</game><game id="13750">Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings</game><game id="11083">Rocky Rodent</game><game id="12297">Sonic Mega Collection Plus</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2369765-genesis_bubsy.jpg</image></root>
