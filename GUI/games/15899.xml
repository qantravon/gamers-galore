The aim is to line up a number of like dice to match the number on the face. For example, to clear the number five, you align five adjacent dice with the number five facing up.   Properly aligned dice will explode and also remove any adjacent dice that are one digit lower than the aligned dice. The campaign mode also adds enemy characters to the game board which can be defeated by exploding dice.  The game supports up to five-player multi-player via multi-tap.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16824">Devil Dice</game><game id="18373">We Love Katamari</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2116206-box_btastic.png</image></root>
