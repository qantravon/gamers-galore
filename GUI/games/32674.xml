Unlike previous games in the series, Alive has been released at a lower price point ($40 in the US) and doesn't offer as many options up-front as some of the previous games have. To offset this, the game has an increased focus on free and paid downloadable add-ons, such as track environments and rider customization options like helmets and other gear.Alive uses an experience points system to track player progress, opening up additional events and options as players increase in rank. The bikes also rank up over time, unlocking more customization options. Most of these options are cosmetic, but unlocking branded tire and suspensions will upgrade those stats on your bikes.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37485">Mad Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2210190-box_mxvsatva.png</image></root>
