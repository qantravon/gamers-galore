STAY DEAD IS OUR FIRST MOTION PICTURE GAMES.

A MOTION PICTURE GAME IS A TRUE INTERACTIVE MEETING POINT BETWEEN MOVIES AND VIDEOGAMES.

PLAYING THIS KIND OF GAME IS LIKE WATCHING THE MOVIE 'INDIANA JONES' AND BEING ABLE TO COMMAND INDIANA IN REAL TIME, JUST LIKE IF HE WAS A VIDEOGAME CHARACTER.
IT'S NOT ABOUT GRAPHIC ADVENTURES OR LASER GAMES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL ARCADE-ACTION GAME.</description><genres><genre>Fighting</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17639-1.jpg</image></root>
