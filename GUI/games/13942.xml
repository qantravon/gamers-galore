The sequel to Chinese filmmaker John Woo's 1992 film Hard Boiled, John Woo Presents Stranglehold emulates the intense, over-the-top gun battles of John Woo films like Hard Boiled, The Killer, and A Better Tomorrow II. Both Woo (who also played a helpful bartender in the original film) and Chow Yun-Fat (who played the main protagonist, Inspector "Tequila" Yuen, in the original film) reprise their roles in the game by contributing their likenesses and doing the voices of their original characters.The game has been compared a lot to the famous Max Payne series, especially the concept of bullet time in Max Payne with that of Tequila Time in Stranglehold. Bullet time, or in case of Stranglehold Tequila Time lets the players to slow down time significantly and this provides the player to have an easy kill opportunity when surrounded by hordes of enemies. The game has such a focus on action and style that there is no reloading of weapons to keep the flow of the shootouts fast and frenetic. Stranglehold includes both single player as well as multiplayer features.GameplayTequila TimeTequila Time will slow down time and lets you pick your enemies, one at a time.Stranglehold includes something called "Tequila Time". During play, you can jump in any direction and interact with any object while aiming at an opponent to trigger Tequila Time or press a button to activate it manually. Tequila Time is managed through a meter which drains and regenerates in time.Style PointsThe player gains style points based on how they kill enemies. Two stars may be awarded just for shooting an enemy, but three or four may be given if the player kills them during a dive. At the end of a level the amount of style points gained are added up and can be used to make purchases at the Unlock Shop.Special AbilitiesThroughout the game you will earn a number of special abilities called Tequila Bomb. The first ability, available from the start of the game, gives players a health boost. The amount of health given depends on the amount of Tequila Bomb energy the player already has built up. The second ability, Precision Aim, slows down time and zooms into first person where you get to accurately aim your gunshot; which usually ends in an instant death for regular enemies. Another ability, Barrage, gives you unlimited ammunition for your weapons and near- invincible health for a short amount of time. The Spin Attack kills most enemies in an area without using any of the players ammo.Paper CranesPaper cranes are hidden throughout each level and when found, each crane fills one section of the Tequila Bomb meter at the bottom left of the screen. An achievement is rewarded for finding 250 cranes.WeaponsThere are seven weapons in John Woo Presents Stranglehold.
