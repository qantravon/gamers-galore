Rather than "Super", the S in the title actually stands for Special.The game contains a single-player mode which works like a Final Fight type brawler, only without the freedom to move up and down the screen. This mode has intermittent boss encounters which play out like regular fights. There is also a versus mode for up to two human players that features a plethora of characters that do not appear in the story.The game was later rereleased as Hiryu no Ken S: Hyper Version. Though largely the same game as Golden Fighter, it received a few performance and gameplay tweaks as well as new enemy placement for the single player mode. This updated version would be released in the US Ultimate Fighter.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22953">Ultimate Fighter</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game><game id="20828">China Warrior</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7900/307945-golden_fighter.jpg</image></root>
