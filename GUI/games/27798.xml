<root><id>27798</id><name>Hero's Journey</name><description> OverviewHero's Journey is a fantasy MMORPG developed by   Simutronics. There is currently no official release date, and development is on hiatus after the staff was laid off or reassigned to other projects in mid-2009.  Hero's Journey will utilize an engine developed by Simutronics called "HeroEngine." This is the same engine being used by        Bioware to develop    Star Wars: The Old Republic. This is a departure from Simutronics' other popular games, GemStone IV and DragonRealms, which are both text-based MUDs.   HistoryHero's Journey has been in the development stage since the 1990's. The release date has been pushed back many times since the announcement of the game. The official Hero's Journey website was last updated sometime in September of 2009.</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17494">Guild Wars</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/32253/1104628-hj_logo_black.jpg</image></root>
