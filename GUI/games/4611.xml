Â It contains a total of seventeen characters, some of which have more than one animation loop, as well as fifty special effects, thirty-five backdrops and several hundred props, all from the TV show. Though far less sophisticated than most animation studio software, including Flash, it can still be fairly complex for animation novices until they've spent some time exploring the options available.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29448">Create with Garfield!</game><game id="41896">Spiderman Cartoon Maker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4938/275891-cover.jpg</image></root>
