In addition, the standard musical pitch and notation  can be changed, as well as the design of the tuner (choose one of three  designs). If you're feeling especially in-tune, test your ear by taking  on the Tuner Fight minigame's challenge: balloons with notes on them rise from pipes, and can only be popped by making a tone that matches the pitch shown.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="86">Balloon Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6087/1703731-1.jpg</image></root>
