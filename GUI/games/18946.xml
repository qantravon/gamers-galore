Like Wave Race and it's praise garnered for it's water physics, 1080 was well received based on how the snow was represented. Down the slopes you would hear the "swoosh" sounds coming from the snow, and would be have appropriately as in real life. Powdered snow would send a cloud of it in the air, ice would show your reflection, and your board would leave behind tracks in the snow.Surprisingly, unlike it's other extreme sport cousin, 1080 was noted to be a very technical and overall difficult game. The hardest aspect of the game was positioning your board properly in order to land without wiping out. Other criticisms were given towards the game's AI, which would actually rubberband and would catch up to you much faster than the player trying to catch up to the computer.Nonetheless, the game had no rival at it's time, and it took several years until it was trumped by EA's SSX series. A sequel to 1080 Snowboarding was released on the Gamecube called 1080 Avalanche. Developed by NST, the game received harsher criticisms compared to it's predecessor, most common complaints being frame rate issues and very little gameplay.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="33">Snowboarding/Skiing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17149">SSX 3</game><game id="20954">Shaun White Snowboarding</game><game id="12418">SSX on Tour</game><game id="18782">SSX Tricky</game><game id="17969">SSX Blur</game><game id="565">Twisted Edge: Extreme Snowboarding</game><game id="18426">Snowboard Kids 2</game><game id="16647">Amped 3</game><game id="18062">Snowboard Kids</game><game id="1509">Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding</game><game id="22898">Trick'n Snowboarder</game><game id="16640">Rippin' Riders</game><game id="15277">TransWorld Snowboarding</game><game id="23479">Stoked</game><game id="25097">Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder</game><game id="24404">Snowboard Riot</game><game id="24449">We Ski &amp; Snowboard</game><game id="21727">MTV Sports: Snowboarding</game><game id="20880">We Ski</game><game id="7128">Cool Boarders 2001</game><game id="22568">Big Mountain 2000</game><game id="35516">Winter Stars</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2213145-box_1080s.png</image></root>
