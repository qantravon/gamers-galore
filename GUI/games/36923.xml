Gameplay consists of walking from left to right, jumping over pits and stomping on the heads of enemies like bees, rabbits and some weird brown toothy things (as seen on box art).This $1.00 game makes it's impression through it's presentation. In the same way Kirby's Epic Yarn demanded attention with it's unique visuals, Cutouts! stands out from the rest of the Indie Games lineup due to it being made entirely with felt. The game's creator and sole developer, Rob Louie, scanned every piece of content onto to his computer and created his world of felt.The game has the player trekking through 3 differently themed worlds containing a total of 9 felt-filled levels. All for what seems to be a search for a mysterious woman.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/101346/2063327-cutouts_boxart.jpg</image></root>
