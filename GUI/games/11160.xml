The winner is the player that who survives to the end of the game and has the most game points.  The amount of game points awarded is based on how the player did in the league and cups and how much money they have left.</description><genres><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/793419-bcff__1_.gif</image></root>
