The fourth sequel Shin Kamaitachi no Yoru: 11ninme no Suspect was released in 2011 for the PS3 and PlayStation Vita.In 2012, it was announced that Kamaitachi no Yoru would be localized into English for the first time by Agetec and would be released for iOS platforms but no further information has been revealed about the release.ReceptionKamaitachi no Yoru became one of Chunsoft's most popular games in Japan with all the remakes and ports combined selling almost a million copies. The game's popularity encouraged other developers to create similar games and soon the term "sound novel" represented a whole genre instead of just games made by Chunsoft.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27266">999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors</game><game id="30224">Otogirisou</game><game id="30562">Imabikis≈ç</game><game id="37949">Yakouchuu</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2133129-kamaitachi_no_yoru01.jpg</image></root>
