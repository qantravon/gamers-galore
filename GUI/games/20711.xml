<root><id>20711</id><name>Madden NFL 09</name><description>OverviewThe latest in the long line of Madden NFL games is slated for release on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PSP. It features a variety of new additions to the series, including a holographic environment for players to train in, a player skill analysis system, an on-demand picture-in-picture play-call window, a new system of dynamic cameras, the ability to play custom music, and much more.Cover AthleteThe legend in his new jerseyBrett Favre was chosen as the cover athlete for the game by EA, when he had announced his retirement from football. The decision was announced on the Late Show with Dave Letterman, and sparked rumors that EA was trying to kill off the "Madden Curse" by having a non-active player on the cover. Officially, EA simply said they wanted to honor Favre's career. However, in August, Favre announced he would be returning to football as a Jet. Obviously, due to production, the cover picture still has Favre in a Packers Jersey, even though he is technically a Jet this season. EA.com will have a downloadable cover featuring Favre in a Jets uniform, but no retail runs of the game will be made with Favre in a Jets uniform. Despite not being expected to play this season, Favre is included as a playable character in the game, via roster update. The madden curse was also effective this year on Brett Favre possibly makeing this his last year to play football.Feature BreakdownXbox 360  PS3Picture-in-Picture windowIn this years Madden EA has added a new "Adaptive Difficulty Engine" which will change the AI's strengths depending on the player's skills.

This edition of the game will sell for $89.99 and include the following:Madden NFL 09 20th Anniversary Collectors EditionNFL Head Coach 09Exclusive Bonus ContentFully playable version of Madden NFL 93Retro play books from every past Madden gameDemoA demo for Madden 2009 will be made available for PSN and XBL on August 1st. Gamers will be able to take the full Madden I.Q. test in the Virtual Trainer which consists of passing, rushing, pass defense, and rush defense drills.Once done with the I.Q. test gamers will be able to play one of the new Madden Moments. The moment will be leading the New York Giants down the field with 2 minutes to go in Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots. There is no limit on how many times/how long the demo can be played.Patch 2.0EA have released a second patch to Madden NFL 09 which fixed some major issues with the game.Kicking play disconnectIf two opponents play a game with two different camera angles, in any situation where a game winning or tying kick was to be made, a disconnect could occur. "ActionCam" forces the game to go into slow-motion to add drama to these late kicks, but unfortunately the Classic camera does not, thus forcing the "disconnect". This has been fixed...all cameras can still be used as well.Stability issues in the play call / halftime highlights / post-game highlightsDuring the play calling screen or highlights screen the game would freeze and as a result all progress would be lost forcing the player to play the game over again."WR direct snap" exploitSome players found an exploit to direct snap to a WR for easy short yardage gain. Not only are EA fixing this play (i.e. they aren't removing it), they are also going to be re-setting records for anyone with a winning record that has been found to be using this play.Franchise Progression / RegressionThe lack of higher numbers was a tuning value that I think everyone agreed was just too low. This has been juiced up so you should see more realistic progression now.Edited players don't progressPlayers were not progressing after their jersey number (or pretty much any other attribute). This has been fixed.Stability issue when exiting Madden '93 in CE versionThis has been fixed.Deep ball glitchSome players found a way to throw a deep ball while crossing the LOS and hit a receiver wide open at a decent rate. EA addressed this by making sure the DB will no longer break on the ball when the QB crosses the line while throwing.CPU running out of boundsThis bug appears when the CPU tries to switch hands while running to the sidelines.
