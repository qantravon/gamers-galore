<root><id>7401</id><name>Bachelorette Party/Burning Desire</name><description>BackgroundWhen adult-game company Mystique went out of business, PlayAround bought the rights to their games. Along with the original Mystique titles, PlayAround also released a number of their own adult-themed games. These games were released in pairs on special "double-end" cartridges.OverviewThe two games contained in this release are "Bachelorette Party" and "Burning Desire".Bachelorette PartyBachelorette Party is actually a re-working of the earlier Mystique game Bachelor Party. The game features a woman bouncing pong-style back and forth, eliminating advancing rows of men. In this version, the gender roles are reversed (in Bachelor Party, it was a man bouncing towards rows of women).Burning Desire Burning Desire is an original game created by PlayAround. It features a naked man attached to a helicopter, hovering over a burning fire. Your job is to put the fires out and rescue a woman (in the most graphic way possible) while avoiding stones thrown by restless natives.
