Originally released for mainframe computers, the game was not available on any home personal computers until the 80's, though it was available on the office microcomputer Xerox Alto in 1979: Video of Maze War being played on two Xerox Alto machines.Gameplay is simple by later standards. Players wander around a maze, being capable of moving backward or forwards, turning right or left in 90-degree increments, and peeking through doorways. The game also uses simple tile-based movement, where the player moves from square to square. Other players are seen as eyeballs. When a player sees another player, they can attack them. While the movement was limited, the ability to move around in a first-person view was an innovation that set it apart from the more well known first-person light-gun shooters at the time where the player was always static.The game's influence was most apparent in the role-playing genre, particularly early dungeon crawlers such as Moria, Wizardry, and Ultima, which utilized a similar first-person view along with tile-based movement and 90-degree rotations. In turn, first-person role-playing games influenced what would later become known as the first-person shooter genre.A similar game was available on Atari home computers in the mid 80's, titled MIDI Maze, as it used the MIDI protocol and the machine's built in MIDI ports as a means of network communication.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="7694">Wolfenstein 3D</game><game id="3407">Duke Nukem 3D</game><game id="14233">3-Demon</game><game id="10852">Faceball 2000</game><game id="31164">Super Maze Wars</game><game id="16825">Midi-Maze</game><game id="5793">Gloom</game><game id="2616">Dungeons of Daggorath</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8192/523089-mazewar.jpg</image></root>
