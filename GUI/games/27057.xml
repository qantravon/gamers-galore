<root><id>27057</id><name>Mad Dog McCree: Gunslinger Pack</name><description>OverviewThis is a    Nintendo WIi port of three   American Laser Games'  full motion video light-gun arcade titles developed by Digital Leisure. It features Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog McCree II: The Lost Gold, and The Last Bounty Hunter. All three games are more or less arcade perfect, and feature the scoring system that's been missing from previous Digital Leisure ports. Each game features a series of FMV clips during which the player must shoot the bad guys or lose a life. The games alternate between long-take, story oriented scenes, and shooting gallery scenes where bad guys pop up at random. Each game also features some branching paths and randomized elements to help offset the limited replay value that comes with using FMV clips for graphics.In addition to featuring the original single player modes from the arcade versions, two multiplayer modes have been added to the games. The first is a co-op mode where up to four players can play the game at once and everyone contributes to a general score pool. The other mode is a competitive mode where each player has their own score and competes to earn the highest total.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39228">Stay Dead</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8960/2286573-mccree.jpg</image></root>
