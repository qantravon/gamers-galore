Alien monsters, disease, intra-party bickering, all must be overcome to reach your destination.Your landing party is taken out of a pool of famous historical figures, movie stars, celebrities, or people that you define yourself. Each member has RPG-style statistics that determine what they are good at, or not so good. In the game, the party will face a number of encounters, and will have the option to shoot, melee, negotiate or flee. The decisions that you, the party captain, makes will determine the result of the adventure and the fate of the starship.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/17/179055/2420643-landing_party.png</image></root>
