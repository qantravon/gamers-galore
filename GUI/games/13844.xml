The game was released on 26 June 2006 in the United States. The game features a three dimensional game engine and individual modeling of game character behaviors. The game has then been released in Spain and Italy in December 2006 by FX Interactive under the name Imperium Civitas. The games Imperium I - III are RTS games based on the Roman Empire and produced by Haemimont and FX Interactive for Spain and Italy: more than one million of these games have been sold. This explains the different name of GotRE in these countries.  In the game, the player assumes the roles of city planner, governor, and military leader. Successful players will need planning skills, economic savvy and -- should those fail -- military might. Glory of the Roman Empire will challenge gamers to grow a small village into a thriving community through trade with neighbors, while also expanding and defending its borders through more militaristic means. Players will need to focus on the physical and emotional health of the citizenry; as villagers age and mature under strong leadership, they contribute to the development of more advanced societies and larger cities.    </description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15262">Imperium Romanum</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2748/300210-3.jpg</image></root>
