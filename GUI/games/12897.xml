It uses a bird's eye behind-the-car perspective popularized by games like Sega's OutRun. As most of the competitive races are one-on-one there is a permanent second window below the first - while playing single player, this window simply stays at the finish line.As with a previous Namco TG-16 game, World Court Tennis, Namco added an unusual RPG mode which plays much like other JRPGs of the era with the main difference being that all battles are played out as single lap races against other drivers. The player must challenge the star racers of each area before they can move onto the next and must upgrade their vehicles to stand any chance of winning. The player earns "special parts" from defeated champions which assists them against subsequent foes.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18177">Turbo</game><game id="11260">OutRun</game><game id="34442">World Court Tennis</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365534-tg16_finallaptwin.jpg</image></root>
