The sequel to    Castlevania: The Adventure, Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge re-adds the traditional sub-weapon system. Similar to the original   Mega Man games, this game allows the player to play the four initial stages in any order.Â Set 15 years after vampire hunter        Christopher Belmont defeats       Count Dracula, Dracula returns and kidnaps Christopher's son,      Soleiyu. The forces of darkness transforms Soleiyu into a demon, which aids Dracula's resurrection into human form. Players control Christopher as he travels through five castles in order to confront Dracula and rescue his son.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28250">Rusty</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1773379-box_cv2br.png</image></root>
