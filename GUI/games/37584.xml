The franchise went dormant for two years after EA Canada's disastrously received attempt at rebooting and renaming the franchise with NBA Elite 11. Elite's release was delayed a week before the scheduled date and officially declared cancelled months later. As a result, Electronic Arts did not release an NBA game for the 2010-2011 NBA season, and no release was scheduled for the following lockout-shortened 2011-2012 season. Development duties of EA's simulation basketball series were reportedly passed to EA Tiburon shortly after the cancellation of NBA Elite.NBA Live 13 was officially cancelled on September 27, 2012; a week before its expected release. This marked the third year in a row that EA did not release an NBA simulation game.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38377">NBA 2K13</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2224972-2224971-teasercover.jpg</image></root>
