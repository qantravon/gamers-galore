It features Japanese TV psychic Masuaki Kiyota, who is best known in his native land for a spoon-bending act similar to that of Israeli psychic Uri Geller.The player can explore the world using two commands: Feel and Exit. Exit will simply move the player character to a new area, while Feel is how the player interacts with the various objects and people in the world; for the purposes of the game, the term "feel" is analogous to "sense". The player is also able to input their own name upon starting the game. As well as the adventure game elements, much of the game involves playing mini-games designed to test the player's psychic ability, such as a card game where the player must guess which symbol will appear next.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40133">Mr. Gold - Kinsan in the Space</game><game id="17444">Hoshi wo Sagashite...</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2380882-mindseeker_fc.jpg</image></root>
