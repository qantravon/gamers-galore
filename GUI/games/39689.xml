Gameplay consists of timing jumps and other abilities to avoid hazards and collect lums.Unlike many mobile games featuring auto-running, Jungle Run does not feature randomly generated, endless levels. Jungle Run has 40 hand-designed, finite levels, generally lasting under 1 minute (if performed successfully). The 40 levels are divided evenly among 5 worlds, with each world adding a new mechanic. These levels introduce jumping, flying, wall-running, punching, and water-sliding.The ultimate goal is not to simply reach the end of the level, but to collect all 100 lums hidden within the level, which often requires taking more difficult or hidden paths. Collecting 100 lums in 5 stages in a given world unlocks a harder level set in the Land of the Livid Dead.In December 2012, Downloadable Content for the game was released, consisting of ten new levels, as well as new playable characters, Globox, Evil Rayman, and Globox Rayman.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39290">Pitfall!</game><game id="37256">Temple Run</game><game id="39653">Ninja Hunting</game><game id="41488">Garfield's Escape</game><game id="43367">Pac-Man Dash!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2481865-box_rmjr.png</image></root>
