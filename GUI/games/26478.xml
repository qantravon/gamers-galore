You cannot move outside the boundaries of the shape with purple lines. Capturing the green glowing enemies drops a green pickup. This pickup will enable you to close the shape once you've gotten one for every point of the shape. (After you collect all the necessary green pickups you have to close the shape in a similar fashion that you would use to capture enemies.)Capturing the yellow glowing enemies drop extra life pickups and the normal enemies drop score pickups. All the pickups will disappear after a short length of time. Collecting pickups adds to the meter in top right of the screen; filling this meter allows you to create more triangle shaped nets. You have a limited number of lives but you can restart at the latest level and try again.The game contains 48 levels with 18 enemies.
