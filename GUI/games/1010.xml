Since it was unofficial, only two home versions of the game were made: a 1987 release from Atari Corp. for the Atari 2600 VCS, and a 1988 release from Eagle Soft, Inc. for the Commodore 64. The C64 version credits Namco with the original arcade release copyright, but that is incorrect. An Atari 5200 version was also in development, but was cancelled due to the death of the system. That version has since been released on the homebrew scene.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="21356">Pac Pack</game><game id="6332">Ms. Pac-Man</game><game id="19552">Pac-Man: Championship Edition</game><game id="3269">Crystal Castles</game><game id="4559">K.C.
