They are split into two teams, the Red Tomatoes and the Green Peppers and both have a celebrity chief to help them out. After they have cooked the meal, the audience then votes for who they thought did the best meal. The game also follows the same routine, but lacks any celebrity appearances.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6163">Cooking Mama</game><game id="21824">Cooking Mama: World Kitchen</game><game id="20924">Order Up!</game><game id="21063">Hell's Kitchen</game><game id="24399">What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver</game><game id="23074">Cooking Guide: Can't Decide What to Eat?</game><game id="7604">Cooking Mama 2: Dinner with Friends</game><game id="26385">Cooking Mama 3: Shop and Chop</game><game id="3685">Cooking Mama: Cook Off</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15044/1115430-readysteadycookthegameswii.jpg</image></root>
