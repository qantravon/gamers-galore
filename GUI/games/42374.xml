RedLynx’s signature franchise, the Trials series first made its mark in gaming with the 2008 release of Trials 2 SE for the PC. That breakout indie success led to further success on the Xbox, but ever since then PC gamers have been clamoring for more Trials. Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is what they have been waiting for.

The Gold Edition Is Two Trials In One

Trials Evolution: Gold Edition will contain all the content of the original, best-selling XBLA game Trials Evolution. In addition, all of the single player tracks and skill games from Trials HD will be found in Trials Evolution – effectively doubling the content offering with two complete games, neither of which have ever before been available on PC.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/16744-1.jpg</image></root>
