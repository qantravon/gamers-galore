Barnum, whose legacy of 'suckers' and 'freaks' defined the yin and yang of outcast culture." It also includes a quote from Federico Fellini: "I don't see freaks. I see people."  Freak Show Cast of FreaksHarry the Head Herman the Human MoleWanda the Worm WomanTex the BarkerJelly Jack the Boneless BoyMickey the Mumbling MidgetBouncing Benny the Bump Soundtrack  The track listing of The Residents' Freak Show album is:  Everyone Comes to the Freak Show                  Harry the Head                  Herman, the Human Mole                  Wanda, the Worm Woman                  Jello Jack, the Boneless Boy                  Benny, the Bouncing Bump                  Mickey, the Mumbling Midget                  Lillie                  Nobody Laughs When They Leave          </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20294/1309456-residentsfreakshow.jpg</image></root>
