Graphics have been made in a very cartoonish style with a Top-Down perspective. On each track (mostly cyclical) you have to win the race of several laps by avoiding driving out the road. After each track you gain the points depending on the place you finish.This is mainly a single player game, but it also includes multiplayer. If you choose to play single player the other three cars will be controlled by the computer. If you want to compete against other people in the game, you choose multiplayer. In multiplayer you will need an IPX-compatible network to play.Ahlgrens Bilspelet was released in 1997 on the PC (Windows).</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26010">Mad Mix Game: The Pepsi Challenge</game><game id="33194">Coca-Cola Kid</game><game id="11746">Cool Spot</game><game id="40149">Doritos Crash Course 2</game><game id="33114">Doritos Crash Course</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1233/335256-ahlgrens.gif</image></root>
