The game features many different wrestlers who all are similar to pro wrestlers at the time. For example, some characters look like Mr. Perfect and Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat. It was released in 1988 and at the time the WWF, but soon after the Main Event was released official WWF titles began to be released. Gameplay  You can see many inspirations from the WWF     There were eight different wrestlers to choose from:  Kamikaze Ken, The Maui Mauler, San Antonio Smasher, Conan The Great, El Condor, Saturn Six, Bigfoot Joe and Alan The Empire. The game could be played with 1 to 4 players, and you could play only tag team matches. When you play one player you choose your player and computer controlled partner, and in 4 each player controls a character. The controls were made up of a 8 way joystick, action button and tag button. The joy stick moved the character, the action button did all wrestling moves and the tag button only tagged characters in and out.</description><genres><genre id="10">Wrestling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16684">Saturday Night Slam Masters</game><game id="8027">WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/68180/1551600-1181242136325.png</image></root>
