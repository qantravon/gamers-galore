<root><id>37928</id><name>Echoes of Eternea</name><description>OverviewEchoes of Eternea is an upcoming RPG for the PC being developed by a small independent team led by Ryan Harmon. It is meant to be a modern take on classically designed Japanese RPGs of the early 1990s. The team is currently receiving pledges to help the project's development through Kickstarter.com and exceeded their target goal of $10,000 in the first few days after it was posted.Originally developed in RPG Maker VX, development has since been transferred to a new, custom engine being developed by Divergent Games. The game was originally entitled "Echoes of Eternia", however, after receiving a legal letter from Mattel telling them they could not use the word "Eternia" (the setting of the Masters of the Universe franchise), they were forced to change the title.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2174022-1.jpg</image></root>
