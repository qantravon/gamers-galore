Voiced by the actual people from the show with the exception of Bam Margera, these minigames are full of hilarious ball-hitting enjoyment.  A  DS version with the same title was also released but is a completely different game both in genre and gameplay.Soundtrack    Anti-Nowhere League - I Hate People Balzac - WallCakecutter - Nude Country Circle Jerks - Live Fast and Die Young Circle Jerks - I'm Gonna Live CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings Chris Pontius – Karazy     Chris Pontius - Swamp Boogie Datsuns - Sittin' Pretty Datsuns - What Would I Know Dave Rohen - Party Boy Theme Deviants - Again Marginal Man - Friend Minutemen - Corona Misfits - Spinal Remains Nashville Pussy - Come on, Come On Nashville Pussy - Hate and Whiskey Roger Alan Wade - BB Gun Roger Alan Wade - If You're Gonna Be Dumb, You Gotta Be Tough Skinny Puppy - Politikil Smut Peddlers - Coopers Smut Peddlers - Do the Flop Turbonegro - Selfdestructo BustTurbonegro - Prince of the Rodeo Vandals - Urban Struggle Virginia City Revival - Drink for Free </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23096">Big Brother Series 2 - The Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/325587-jackasspsp.jpg</image></root>
