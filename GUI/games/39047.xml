The game is set against the backdrop of a long-running conflict between Earth and alien invaders referred to as Phantom Beasts that first invaded Earth in 1945 during World War II, bringing the war to a screeching halt as a new war began. The conflict has continued to the present day of 1999; a time when the Phantom Beasts control half of the planet. In their efforts to combat the alien force, humans have developed Humanoid Walking Tanks, or HWTs, as their primary means of fighting the invaders. However, Japan, suffering a shortage of soldiers, begins drafting high school students as soldiers and enrolling them in a special program that keeps them in a high school setting for their educational needs when not training or on the battlefield.Gunparade March was followed by the PS2 Gunparade Orchestra trilogy. The game was also adapted into a three-volume manga and a twelve-episode television anime series.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2268907-cover.png</image></root>
