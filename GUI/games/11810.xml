Multiple paths along the level are available with some leading to dead ends. Fuel stops are also possible in order to refuel.    Once the end of the level is reached the course must be driven in reverse while being raced back by a ghost over the same obstacles and reach the end safely.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15042">Kikstart 2</game><game id="26923">Trials HD</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1383503-wheelie3.jpg</image></root>
