MoleZ was a decent hit, but it's development was stopped in 1999 when the source code and tools were lost. It's available now as freeware.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2007">Worms</game><game id="14095">Mine Bombers</game><game id="10757">Liero</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/32504/1415835-molez1.jpg</image></root>
