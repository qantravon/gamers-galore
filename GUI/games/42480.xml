But two problems emerge: an evil witch sends her demon army against the royal family and Arthur is mortally wounded. So the player takes the role of Arthur's son William Pendragon.

The basic playing principle is still a mixture between role-playing, turn-based strategy and tactical battles in real time. However, the complexity of the strategy map has been reduced (less province management) and the importance of quests and story is greater. One of the consequences is that the player is restricted to one army until two more are gained during the course of the plot.</description><genres /><image /></root>
