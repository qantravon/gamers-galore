As with that game, Waialae Country Club takes place in a prestigious US golf course (the eponymous Waialae) and features all 18 holes to play through.As with TE Soft's other golf sims, more care is taken towards realism and simulation elements, meaning it is drier and more difficult than many other console golf games. It takes full advantage of the SNES's mode 7 capabilities to depict a 3D course. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6799">PGA Tour Golf</game><game id="1336">Cyber Tiger</game><game id="2573">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001</game><game id="14247">PGA Tour Golf III</game><game id="6957">Outlaw Golf 2</game><game id="30540">HAL's Hole In One Golf</game><game id="38171">Masters New: Harukanaru Augusta 3</game><game id="39086">World Masters Golf</game><game id="31021">Jack Nicklaus Golf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1029820-588830_84763_front.jpg</image></root>
