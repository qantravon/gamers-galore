The sequel to Doritos Crash Course, Doritos Crash Course 2 adds 20 new levels in new exotic locations (ranging from a tropical jungle to ancient Egypt), new gameplay mechanics (including ledge grabbing and collecting "stars" to unlock special power-ups and content), microtransactions, and support for Avatar FameStar.Like the original Doritos-branded game, players must run through obstacle courses (using their Avatars) in similar vein to Japanese-style "obstacle course" game shows (such as the Japanese Sasuke and the American Wipeout). Scattered throughout the levels are a variety of pitfalls, conveyor belts, sloped floors, walls, and other obstacles.Players can earn "stars" by collecting them throughout each level, by finishing a level with a high medal placement, and by performing special level-based challenges. Stars (and coins, which is usually bought with real money) can be used to purchase new levels, shortcuts to existing levels, "rewinds" (used to temporarily turn back time in the single-player mode), power-ups (used to temporarily boost an ability), "jinxes" (used to give multiplayer opponents humiliating costumes), and "Avatar effects" (special effects that surround and trail the Avatar).</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7631">Ahlgrens Bilspelet</game><game id="36660">Wipeout 2</game><game id="35566">Trials Evolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2437068-box_dcc2.png</image></root>
