A sequel to the PlayStation strategy RPG Tear Ring Saga, it is, like its predecessor, heavily reminiscent of the Fire Emblem franchise. Possibly due to the legal issues Tirnanog and Enterbrain encountered with the first game (Nintendo sued, accusing the developer of copyright infringement and won on appeal), Berwick Saga is also the last game in the series.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14915">Fire Emblem Gaiden</game><game id="20805">Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi</game><game id="18005">Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu</game><game id="13073">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2273797-c.png</image></root>
