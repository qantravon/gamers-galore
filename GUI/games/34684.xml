The game's story is based on popular centuries-old Japanese folklore, such as the story of Momotaro and tales depicting the demonic Oni and their mischief.The original characters created for this game would be later referenced by future Nintendo products with retrospective elements, such as Captain Rainbow or the Super Smash Bros series (SSB Brawl even had a remixed version of Shin Onigashima's music for the Ice Climbers stage).</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37545">Famicom Mukashi Banashi: Yuyuki</game><game id="37810">Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</game><game id="37842">Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de...</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="28876">Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!!</game><game id="39840">Ripple Island</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/1750807-1.png</image></root>
