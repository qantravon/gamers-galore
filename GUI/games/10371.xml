<root><id>10371</id><name>Rolo to the Rescue</name><description>GameplayThe objective in every level is to find a puzzle piece that unlocks the next level and rescue all the animals that are locked in cages. The keys are held by certain enemies. The levels vary from underground caves to deserts. The enemies can be killed by either jumping on them or shooting an object such as a rock on them from Rolo's trunk. There are four types of animals with different special skills.  The mole can dig through wall, the rabbit jumps high in the air, the beaver can swim over water obstacles and the squirrel can climb walls. By rescuing an animal the animal joins Rolo's group. If Rolo or any of the other animals is hit by an enemy, the player loses one of the animals in the group. The player can also leave an animal out from the group to make room for another. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371409-genesis_rollototherescue_eu.jpg</image></root>
