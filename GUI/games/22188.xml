The only characters to return to the franchise are    Sol Badguy and   Ky Kiske.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12125">Capcom Fighting Evolution</game><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1879016-box_gg2.png</image></root>
