<root><id>9917</id><name>P.O.W.: Prisoners of War</name><description>OverviewP.O.W. is a scrolling beat 'em-up, allowing simultaneous two-player gameplay. Players control escapees from a POW camp, who have to punch, kick, stab and shoot their way out. This is one of the first scrolling beat 'em-ups to allow players to also use guns to attack enemies. Whilst there is little change in the enemies faced, mostly palette variations of the same 3 types, it does seem to allow more enemies to be on the screen at once.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2536">Altered Beast</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game><game id="7383">NAM-1975</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game><game id="18293">Renegade</game><game id="4146">Vigilante</game><game id="17694">Dustin</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362104-nes_pow_2.jpg</image></root>
