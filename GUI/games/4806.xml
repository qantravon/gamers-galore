To your aid you have the Ark, a massive self-aware organic space ship, equipped with space faring dolphin probes. You have to visit planets, communicate and establish relationships with alien species, presented in glorious pre-rendered 3D landscapes and populated with puppets.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11717">Inca</game><game id="15199">Privateer 2: The Darkening</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
