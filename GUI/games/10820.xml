Two of these universes have but put into a state of temporal stasis and Rene Korda must travel into them to find out who is responsible. Utilizing bottled time enables him to walk freely around these worlds and allows any part of the world he is standing near to operate outside of the stasis. The player can choose to leave bottled time with objects so they may continue to function without the player having to stand next to it which makes up a lot of the ingame puzzles. When the player runs out of bottled time he gets stuck in stasis, unable to complete the game which leads to a game over, bottled time is replenished by returning to your ship. Voice Cast  The main character Rene Korda was voiced by  Ron Perlman .  The voice of Korda's PDA robot is voiced by   Lolita Davidovich.  Korda's former student, MIlo, is voiced by  Brent Spiner.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3460">Discworld</game><game id="6351">Discworld II: Mortality Bytes!</game><game id="4203">Discworld Noir</game><game id="3019">The Secret of Monkey Island</game><game id="17544">Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars</game><game id="4084">Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror</game><game id="5804">Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/721446-chronomaster_cover.jpg</image></root>
