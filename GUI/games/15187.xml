<root><id>15187</id><name>Descent Maximum</name><description>Descent Maximum was originally planned to be a straight forward port of Descent II (and in Europe the game was still titled Descent II), but due to Sony's policies regarding ports from other platforms, as well as the technical limitations of the PlayStation, the original levels were scrapped and 36 new levels were designed with the console's limitations and favored gameplay style in mind - the levels were much smaller than on PC, and were conforming more to a two dimensional plane in order to be easier to navigate with the PS1's digital controller (the PS1 controllers with analog sticks were still another year from being released).The enemy designs, cutscenes and most textures are reused from Descent II on PC, and the soundtrack consists of the PC's redbook music for Descent II and the Vertigo expansion, though some songs are alternate or extended mixes.
