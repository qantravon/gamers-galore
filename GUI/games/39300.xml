The hero fights using a stream of throwing daggers that fly horizontally for a few meters before vanishing, which have an added benefit of being able to pass through walls. The player can also collect various power-ups to increase the strength of the hero's daggers, as well as gain XP after Youkai battles that will eventually increase the hero's parameters.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39617">Youkai Yashiki</game><game id="39865">Shadow Land</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2289882-youkai_club_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
