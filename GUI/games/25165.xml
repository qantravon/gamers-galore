Once the sprite that defines the level is complete, you can elect to move onto the next level or retry the same level.As you eliminate blocks during each level, you collect coins which can then be used in the shop where you can unlock and purchase the music played throughout the game (see below) or purchase "Dark" level. Â There exists one Dark level per normal level, and you can play them as soon as you purchase them. However, you can't purchase a Dark level for a level which you haven't played yet. SoundtrackAll of the music is classic NES game tunes rearranged by the Japanese electronica group,   YMCK.Remixes of famous and obscure NES game music and SFX accompany the levels featuring characters from the same game..01.
