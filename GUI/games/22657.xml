This game features a collection of mini-games that coincide with events in the film. This features 30 mini-games on the PSP release but only 25 in the DS release, however the DS version was more popular and acclaimed than the PSP edition due to the fact that the DS version follows the film's story more, even though the game is supposed to take place directly where the first film left off. It was developed by 7 Studios and published by Crave Entertainment.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14405">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</game><game id="27026">Nacho Libre</game><game id="29102">Segata Sanshirou Shinken Yuugi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285676-box_ndtg.png</image></root>
