However, they soon discovered that this was not the case. Instead, they populated the non-music video footage options with royalty-free videos, including political speeches and black-and-white stock films.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18613">Power Factory Featuring C+C Music Factory</game><game id="10670">Make My Video: Kris Kross</game><game id="5307">Make My Video: Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch</game><game id="13898">Moderngroove: Ministry of Sound Edition</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10831/479354-587953_53453_front.jpg</image></root>
