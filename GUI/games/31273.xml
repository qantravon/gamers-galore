<root><id>31273</id><name>Guns of Icarus</name><description>OverviewGuns of Icarus is a mish-mash of various game styles. It charges the player, an airship captain, with the task of single-handedly keeping his vessel flying against constant pirate attacks.Each level will start with you standing on your ship at the captain's wheel in a third person view. Soon pirates will begin attacking, and will show up on your hud's radar. To defend your ship you must run to one of the 6 hard-points upon which various gun emplacements can be fixed and man it. This will turn your view into a first person akin to a turret sequence.There are also other points on the ship that take damage from the attacks and serve as your ship's various health bars. The engines slow your progress through the level as they take damage, the cargo bay's health determines your reward at the end, while the zeppelin and/or rigging's destruction will spell doom for your airship and you. To counteract these various effects you must run to the effected station(s) and give them a good wrenching to keep things in working order.The fact that nothing can be done without your presence means that the main challenge of the game is constantly monitoring the situation and deciding how to divvy up your time.PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS:Windows 7Processor:2 GHz processorMemory:2 GB RAMGraphics:Dedicated video card with 256 MB VRAMDirectXÂ®:dx90cHard Drive:3 GB HD spaceOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connectionMac System RequirementsMinimum:OS:Mac OS X 10.6Processor:2 GHz processorMemory:2 GB RAMGraphics:Dedicated video card with 256 MB VRAMHard Drive:3 GB HD spaceOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connection</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5275/1372864-00133382_medium.jpeg</image></root>
