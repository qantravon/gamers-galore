Starring the system's titular mascot in that region, the game tasks you with playing various     minigames based on the character's famous ads after listening to a dramatic narration about his adventures. These include activities such as    skating on ice, traversing through burning buildings, and wrestling   robots in a minefield, amongst other things. Successful completion of the minigames unlock the Segata Sanshirou ads individually, which can then be viewed at any time. The game also features a quasi-jukebox mode that features just the audio portion of each commercial, none of which need to be unlocked ahead of time.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14405">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</game><game id="15646">WTF: Work Time Fun</game><game id="6424">Mario Party</game><game id="2819">Sonic Shuffle</game><game id="14407">Pac-Man Fever</game><game id="15952">Crash Bash</game><game id="20395">Incredible Crisis</game><game id="22657">Napoleon Dynamite: The Game</game><game id="17965">Rhythm Tengoku</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/429/1178242-segatasanshirobox.gif</image></root>
