A single alien spaceship moves back and forth at the top of the screen slowly dropping blocks of ice onto the ground below, attempting to build a wall. The player controls a character at the bottom of the screen armed with a ray gun, which is used to melt the blocks of ice before they hit the ground. The player must also jump over snowballs that randomly roll across the bottom of the screen. If the wall is completed by the aliens, the player loses. If the player is able to score 10,000 points before the wall is built, the sun rises and the ice melts.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14975/1342739-glacbox3.jpg</image></root>
