The game was an action title of some sort set in Square Enix's Ivalice universe and meant to tie into Final Fantasy XII in some manner. However, Square Enix forced GRIN to stop development on the project for undisclosed reasons. There has been talk that development of Fortress has since been given to another studio, but at this point the game's status is unclear.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/112/1170626-fortress__13_.jpg</image></root>
