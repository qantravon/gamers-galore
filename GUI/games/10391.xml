<root><id>10391</id><name>Rayman Arena</name><description>The racing side of the game is arguably the most interesting as it involves fast-paced foot races that manage to tap into the platforming nature of the series just enough to make it enjoyable. The tracks are basically linear but there are some hidden short-cuts that help trim some seconds off your time. On these tracks you encounter a variety of obstacles including surfaces that cause you to run in slow-motion, spike traps and electric fences. There are twelve tracks though it becomes possible to play these courses in reverse later in the game, mixing things up somewhat. The battle mode is more simplistic, involving a bunch of characters running around a large arena, picking up weapon power-ups and trying to wipe each other out. Each time you take another player out you get a point and the player with the most points at the end of the match wins. There are eight playable characters in the game, many from previous games in the Rayman franchise.Â </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4902">Mad Dash Racing</game><game id="38253">Gekitotsu Toma L'Arc: TomaRunner vs L'Arc-en-Ciel</game><game id="38254">Running High</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2146382-box_rayarena.png</image></root>
