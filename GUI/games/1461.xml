[game mode] Race the Pro, on the other hand challenges you to beat 11 world-famous drivers at their three best tracks... Overall I thoroughly enjoyed playing NASCAR Heat, as the control is immaculate.  I was astounded by the realism that its smooth handling brought to the game".</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20038">NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2210275-box_nascarh2.png</image></root>
