The game is mostly a text-heavy adventure game, though it allows the player to walk around the overworld map with the controller and encounter NPCs. Most NES adventure games at the time would only let the player move around via a menu.Be-Bop High School is a Shounen Jump manga (later an anime and several live-action movies) that features said delinquents and derives much of its comedy from exaggerated facial expressions and unusual fashions and haircuts.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31984">Kenka Bancho</game><game id="40394">Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2340511-be_bop_high_school_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
