These sequences require some gentle descending from the player, such as with other gravity-based side-scrollers like Thrust and Lunar Lander.Airwolf is the first NES game developed by Beam Software, a prolific Australian computer game developer at the time which is now known as Krome Studios Melbourne. As such, it often feels like a computer game compared to the usual quick and simple cash-in games based on licenses that were being released by Acclaim and LJN for the NES at the time.There was a prior Airwolf game for the NES, released in Japan only, which also had the name Airwolf. It was developed by Kyugo Boueki and should not be confused for this version.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8678">Top Gun</game><game id="6054">Top Gun: The Second Mission</game><game id="40533">Airwolf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361128-nes_airwolf.jpg</image></root>
