You play a pick axe which is the God of Destruction and your job is to help Overlord Badman take over the world.Â  You have to create a dungeon, hide Badman deep within and populate it with monsters in order to stop heroes from coming in and taking away badman. In this game they added in a new element to the game, Water. This helps create new monsters in the dungeon you create slowing down the heroes even more.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14945/1167012-namaikida3dart01.jpg</image></root>
