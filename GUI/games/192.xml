<root><id>192</id><name>Toppler</name><description>An early, Russian-language game to be leaked to the West.  In it, your character, named "democrat" attempts to change the staid system by hopping on lilypads (representing ever-changing laws) on the way to the opposite corner of the screen where the milestones of reform lay, all while gathering dots (representing bankable currency and groceries, among other things, although you should avoid the taxes) and bypassing bureaucrats while trying to accumulate points.   </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/913/1364590-perestroika.png</image></root>
