<root><id>20750</id><name>Questprobe Featuring Spider-Man</name><description>OverviewThis game was originally going to be part of a set of twelve adventure  games, each featuring different Marvel Heroes.  Scott Adams made four  and only three were published before Adventure International went  bankrupt.  The first features the Hulk, this is the second, the third  features Human Torch and The Thing from Fantastic Four.  A fourth  unpublished game features the X-Men. By all accounts the fourth game is  available on the web somewhere.  A comic sets the scene (though not very  well) for this second game in the series.  When playing this for the  first time, it isn't clear what the main objective is, but this can be  found out from an ally in the game. Gameplay Various enemies of Spider-man must be defeated and various other puzzles solved in order to eventually complete the game with a score of 100.  Objects (unless otherwise hidden) and exits are clearly stated at each location to ease with navigating around.  This wasn't always the case with text adventures of this era (1980s) and is nice to see here. </description><genres><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30631">Marie Celeste</game><game id="30994">Dracula</game><game id="21865">Questprobe Featuring Human Torch and the Thing</game><game id="7909">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</game><game id="6677">Red Moon</game><game id="23413">Se-Kaa of Assiah</game><game id="11797">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</game><game id="9936">The Hobbit</game><game id="2048">The Price of Magik</game><game id="31440">Questprobe Featuring The Hulk</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7900/263807-questprobe_2_spiderman.jpg</image></root>
