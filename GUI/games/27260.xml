It is a remake of the original Team Fortress Classic on the source engine.  It has a Steam page, but must be downloaded trough the   official website. The current version is; v2.41 The main focus of the game, is to keep the ideas and gameplay of the original     Team Fortress Classic intact, while at the same time making a new game with updated graphics.    Team Fortress 2 changed many things like; replacing the art style of the game with more "cartoony" maps and characters, removal of grenades and removal of friendly fire, and this game caters to those that prefer the original Team Fortress, but would like an update.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
