The goal is to eventually purchase a Formula 1 car that will allow the player to enter the F1 races. These races award a lot more money.The game used a then-popular (thanks to OutRun and its peers) behind the car view, with the twisting track laid out just ahead. Most races are simply against the clock, as you race to qualify. Winning races earns money, which can then be spent on upgrades, which then allow the player to compete in more challenging races, and so on.The starting vehicle is an old Mini Cooper.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20203">World Grand Prix</game><game id="11260">OutRun</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2133787-taito_grand_prix.jpg</image></root>
