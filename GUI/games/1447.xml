<root><id>1447</id><name>Barbarian II</name><description>Barbarian II continues the adventures of Hegor, who in the last game defeated his brother and evil sorcerer, Necron. However, Necron's body was promptly recovered and resurrected by his faithful cult followers. Hegor takes up arms once again to not only put an end to his brother's evil doing but to also avenge his father's death. The original Barbarian was an action game with a 'point-and-click' control interface. Barbarian II plays much like a typical action game and takes place from a side-on view. The player moves between areas across six regions, including sprawling forests, caves, temples and dungeons. Running and jumping comprises a large part of the gameplay, and some of the later levels require significant exploration. Hegor's primary weapons are his broadsword and bow, but he can also acquire other weapons including a short sword and an axe. Note: This is not the Palace Software version of Barbarian 2: The Dungeon Of Drax (UK). See Axe of Rage (US).</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9570">Blade Warrior</game><game id="8343">Death Trap</game><game id="19285">Moonstone: A Hard Days Knight</game><game id="2561">Prince of Persia</game><game id="1866">Ardok the Barbarian</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7804/2494068-barbarian+2.jpg</image></root>
