Runner utilized 3D polygonal technology that could create believable environments and give the player a great sense of speed. The game's sit-down arcade cabinet had players straddle on a mock-up speed bike and control the game using a yoke. S.T.U.N. stands for "Spread Tunnel Underground Network."GameplayUsing the control yoke, players maneuver the bike and adjust the vertical aim of the craft's cannon. Upon completing a stage, the bike is outfitted with new equipment such as wings or a top-mounted gun. Players must complete each stage within the time limit. This is accomplished by avoiding collisions, staying away from side rails, and driving over boost pads.In turns, the fastest part of the course is the outer wall. Driving on the inner wall during a turn will slow the craft, as will rubbing against the rails on straight-aways known as "flats."The player's vehicle has six shields that protect against collisions. After each level, players are given a bonus based on how many shields are left.An "Ultimate Challenge" awaits players who complete every level of the game. The object of this stage is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time.S.T.U.N.
