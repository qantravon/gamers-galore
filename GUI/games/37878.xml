You have two minutes (or less depending on your health and fatigue gauges) to meet the criteria for each level. Typical goals including killing 120 chickens or scoring 10,000 points.GameplayThe main character is controlled with the left joystick or d-pad, with subtle variations to aiming angle. Contact with enemy chickens will decrease your health gauge. Players are able to avoid combat with a dash command, however that will lower your fatigue level. If fatigue and health gauges meet, the round is over regardless of how much time is remaining.Included in the game are light cooking mechanics (the ability to use microwaves to produce health items, or grilled chicken by performing weapon combos) as well as a persistant weapon upgrade system.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/98709/2167234-shootingchickenrevenge.jpg</image></root>
