The circles you create can be expanded to fill up more space, with their size being directly proportional to how long you hold your finger (or thumb) down on the screen. However the circle must be completed before a bouncing marble comes into contact with it and you have a limited number of circles you can create. Gravity and dynamic collisions between circles and marbles also come into play making this seemingly simple game get quite interesting. Each level has different music and circle patterns and a score is calculated at the end that takes into account how many circles were used and the time taken.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/121765/1688964-surfacer.jpg</image></root>
