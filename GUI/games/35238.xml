Ritchie made this game in between two of his most famous tables, Black Knight 2000 and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  It was based on a roller derby  television show which only lasted for one season. RollerGames was also adapted for the arcade and for the Nintendo Entertainment System. GameplayThis table has the "DEEP FREEZE MAGNA-FLIP" magnet, in which the ball is launched into "THE PIT", where it is propelled through a wireform to a magnet that will hold the ball in front of the top flipper that gives the player a guaranteed shot up the ramp referred to as "THE WALL".  There is a randomly-timed feature where THE WALL ramp can score 1 million points, and six consecutive ramp shots can score 8 million points. The game also features three multi-ball drop targets, a left bank of S-K-A-T-E target lights, and the word W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S can be spelled which starts a scoring cycle earning up to 4 million points. </description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1781741-rollergames.jpg</image></root>
