It was first released for the                     PlayStation 2 game console on November 24, 2001, and soon went multi-platform. It is one of the lesser popular games in the franchise.Gameplay The main mode consist of 5 total cars and 12            unlockable cars and 1 hidden car. There are 6 levels. You start off by                   Homer's house and the           time clock starts ticking while you find your first passenger to drop off. There will be a blue light dome where the customer is waiting for a ride. You have to stop near that to pick he/she up. Every time you pick up a passenger, you get a little more time added to your clock. There is a small map in the bottom left corner for your convenience so you don't get lost. You earn          money every time you drop off somebody which contributes to your final total of your fare. When time is running out, a trip timer pops up flashing red in the upper left corner of the screen letting you know that you have less then 10 seconds to drop off your passenger before times up. If you don't drop off your passenger to his destination in time, he/she abandons your car and insults you. Drop off areas are marked in golden light for easier view to your destination. After the level ends, the rating screen pops up and you get to see your high score and insert your initials. You'll often run into the         nuclear toxic transit buses driving ecstatically around the city ramming other cars off the road, all the while                  Smithers and        Monty Burns are driving around looking for you and if they spot you, they will try to ram you and slow you down.  Throughout each level, you will find several things with symbols of           Mr. Burns municipal imperialism on it or the Springfield Transit Corporation bus stops. They can be smash for a time bonus that count towards your time meter. You can add more time to your clock by dropping off customers ahead of schedule. There are plenty of shortcuts to reach destinations a lot faster throughout the levels. You can knock almost everything down that's breakable except trees. Driving into cars will slow down your car immensely. If you get stuck behind a vehicle, it will be very hard to go around it. You will have to reverse and back up till you have enough space to go around the car you crashed into. Some critics would argue that's part of the problem in the game in which the game suffers from poor collision detection, though it can be avoided with proper skills. The game does suffer from weak controls. If you bump into things, you'll crash easily and your car will spin out of control. Since the controls aren't that fluid, you will be able to make quick turns but at the same time crash a lot more.  You can jump off high steep areas to reach a destination faster and drive inside some specific locations that are popular in The Simpsons world. You will be able to enter the Nuclear Power Plant, where Homer works and if you go in you can find his work station in sector 7G. The Springfield Shopping Mall can also be found here. and you can go inside and you'll find many familiar stores from the show. You can go to the Stadium, in Downtown Springfield and you'll get to see the familiar Truckasaurus destroying cars. There are three difficulty levels in the game: The first being Easy, the timer starts at 75 seconds and then there's Medium, the timer starts at 50 seconds and Hard, the timer starts at 40 seconds. The harder the difficulty the more money you earn for time left on your clock at the end of the trip.

You can steal passengers by bumping your competitor's car.Plot synopsis Mr. Burns who owns the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant had just bought the Springfield Transit Corporation and raised the bus fare, making it hard for Springfieldians to get around because the bus fare costs too much. Mr. Burns even converted the buses to nuclear power, giving the drivers free reign to drive recklessly. Well the Simpsons and the citizens of Springfield are not happy with how greedy Mr. Burns is doing with the transit system, so they take matters into there own hands literally. Homer becomes a chauffeur to the eager citizens of Springfield and help the people of Springfield do their errands and pay cheap while at it. In order to stabilize the transit system, the Simpsons needs to earn $1,000,000 to buy back the transit system from Montgomery Burns so everything can go back to normal. Characters   Family Sedan "The Homer" Mr. Plow Honer Roller CanyoneroElec-TaurusShriner's Cart Tractor Klown Kar Plow KingSports Car Sedan School Bus Station WagonCop Car Book Burning Mobile    Flying CarLil Bandit Levels                Evergreen Terrace Entertainment District Springfield Dam Nuclear Power Plant    Downtown Springfield Mountains Cheat CodesEnter any of the following at the option screen while holding L1 R1 (you should hear a zing after you inputed the code successfully) To disable all active codes, press  START four times.
