He is credited in the game's opening credits.The story of the game is that a distant descendant or reincarnation of Takeru Yamato - the legendary prince of the Yamato people that assassinated the leader of the supposedly barbaric Kumaso clan - is looking into the death of his father and discovers a plot by some still-existing Kumaso to resurrect their dark gods.As well as exploring each area, searching for clues and talking to NPCs using a menu-driven interface - as is the case with many adventure games for the system - the player will occasionally fight a boss in a side-view action mode.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40767">Maharaja</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/554766-ankoku_shinwa_box.jpg</image></root>
