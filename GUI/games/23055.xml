Â The basic storyline of the game is that during preparations for a zombie outbreak of the style seen in other  House of the Dead games, two of the horrific abominations created for the project, a man named Zobio and a woman named Zobiko, happened to fall in  love. Deciding that they didn't want to destroy the world after all, Zobio and Zobiko run away together to elope, only to find themselves pursued by other mad creations intent on either dragging them back to the project or destroying them for their insolence. In the most violent elopement ever seen, Zobio and Zobiko must shoot their way through their misshapen brethren to reach freedom together.</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21468">Time Crisis 4</game><game id="15365">Time Crisis 2</game><game id="15867">Time Crisis</game><game id="11454">Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles</game><game id="32711">Rise of Nightmares</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/49846/1293630-hotdex1.jpg</image></root>
