The Business appears to be a success, with several of the local townspeople acting as regular customers for the venture. After damaging the  local Grocer  shop's  store front  with a previous failed invention, a Cheese-detecting machine,  Wallace  promises the owner 50 gallons of honey as to cover the cost of replacements.    However, Wallace returns home to find that he has run out of flowers for his bees to collect Nectar from - forced to improvise, Wallace uses one of his untested Growth formulas on some of his next door neighbours daises in order to turn them into giant flowers for the bees. The formula works and Wallace easily fulfils the Grocer's Honey order, but things quickly go awry when his Bees begin responding to the growth formula, they grow into huge beasts and begin terrorising the town. Gromit manages to successfully trap most of the giant bees, however the Queen Bee kidnaps Wallace and escapes. Chasing after the Queen Bee in the duo's delivery truck,  Gromit  manages to douse the Queen in more growth formula, trapping in underneath a bridge.     Gromit rescues his hapless master from the giant Queen bee.      With all the bees safely recaptured, Wallace creates a shrinking forumla to return them to their normal size. However, in the process, he ends up shrinking himself accidentally.     Gameplay   Fright of the Bumblebees   follows a similar gameplay design to other  Telltale  adventure games such as the  Tales of Monkey Island series  and the  Sam  Max series . Players interact with the game's world by collecting and combining items, as well as talking to other characters, to progress the story. The game also makes use of a variable hint system controlled by the player in the Options Panel - players can change the intensity and detail of the amount of Hints the game gives the player when they are stuck.  Peter Sallis, the actor who lends his voice to Wallace in all of the Wallace and Gromit films, does not return as the voice of Wallace in any of the Grand Adventures games. Instead, Aardman Animation's Offical Back Up voice actor for Wallace, Ben Whitehead, voices the character instead.  PC Requirements Operating System: Microsoft® Windows® XP/VistaProcessor: 2.0 Ghz or better (3 GHz Pentium® 4 or equivalent recommended)Memory: 512 MB RAM (1GB recommended)Hard Disk Space: 310 MBVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX® 8.1 compliant video card (128 MB recommended)Sound Card: DirectX® 8.1 sound deviceDirectX® Version: DirectX® Version 9.0c or better (DirectX updater included)Controller Support: Yes    No internet connection required to play    </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20587">Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner</game><game id="6049">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</game><game id="10837">Bone: Out from Boneville</game><game id="10505">Bone: The Great Cow Race</game><game id="24684">Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space</game><game id="9182">Chicken Run</game><game id="23689">Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode Two</game><game id="20696">Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode One</game><game id="14097">The Neverhood</game><game id="5729">The Curse of Monkey Island</game><game id="26776">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal</game><game id="30008">Sam &amp; Max Episode 301: The Penal Zone</game><game id="30374">Sam &amp; Max Episode 305: The City That Dares Not Sleep</game><game id="26778">Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 3: Lair of the Leviathan</game><game id="9015">Sam &amp; Max Episode 202: Moai Better Blues</game><game id="4885">Sam &amp; Max Episode 203: Night of the Raving Dead</game><game id="4399">Sam &amp; Max Episode 204: Chariots of the Dogs</game><game id="30372">Sam &amp; Max Episode 303: They Stole Max's Brain</game><game id="30373">Sam &amp; Max Episode 304: Beyond the Alley of the Dolls</game><game id="7344">Sam &amp; Max Episode 5: Reality 2.0</game><game id="33416">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 4: Double Visions</game><game id="32592">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 1: It's About Time</game><game id="33414">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 2: Get Tannen!</game><game id="33415">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 3: Citizen Brown</game><game id="33417">Back to the Future: The Game - Episode 5: OUTATIME</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1379/940212-logo.png</image></root>
