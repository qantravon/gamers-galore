<root><id>31078</id><name>Doctor Who: The First Adventure</name><description>Released for the BBC Micro in 1983, it was the first official game based on the Doctor Who franchise.  The character played was the Fifth Doctor and ventured through four different mini-games, similar to the popular video games Pac-Man, Frogger, Battleship and Space Invaders. Sadly, this left it hard to tell that the game was based on Doctor Who. The manual contained an extensive and wordy description of an imminent showdown between the Doctor and the Black Guardian. Like most games of this era, the storyline was kept mainly in the manual and not represented in game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="11903">Frogger</game><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="5356">Battleship</game><game id="37171">Doctor Who Episode 5: The Gunpowder Plot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/935/1354829-doctor_who_first_adventure.jpg</image></root>
