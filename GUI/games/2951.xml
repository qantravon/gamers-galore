You now only need 7/9 possible ex points for a AAA rank, as opposed to the 8/9ths needed in the Japanese games.. 6/9ths grant a AA, 5/9 corresponds to A, and so on.    "Just Great" is now called "Perfect."Difficulties are listed as "Beginner", "Normal", "Hyper", and "Another".Difficulties are now on a 1-10 scale, using stars.  (This preceded the change to the 1-12 scale seen first in Happy Sky.)Hard has been renamed to "Challenge", or "CHA" for short.5-key mode is known as "beatmania" mode, 7-key mode is known as "beatmania IIDX" mode.In 5-key mode, Free Scratch Zones have returned. Free Scratch Zones are areas in songs where you can scratch as much or as little as you want. Scratching in one will only increase your money score - it has no effect on your EX score or grade.There is a replay mode to save replays of songs you have played.The records screen has note counts, money score, playcount, and max combo organized in a DDR-style grid.Songs must be played in Game Mode before they appear in Free Mode.The beatmania songs are rated on a scale of 200,000 points, just like the IIDX songs.All of the 5-key songs received new videos.  Song ListAll Modes[SOUL MIX] WaveGroup/DJ TK-ST - Celebration  [RAVE] e.o.s. - e-motion [ELECTRONICA] Timo Maas - First Day [80'S REVIVAL] Lipps Inc. - Funkytown [TRANCE] L.E.D.
