Like the first game, it was developed for the NES. It was also one of the very last games released for the platform. The game has since seen rerelease via the Wii's Virtual Console service.Story Mike Jones, hero of the original StarTropics, has returned home to Seattle along with his uncle. While his uncle is attempting to decipher the text in a mysterious book, Mica, princess of Argonia, contacts Mike telepathically with a message that helps Mike solve the puzzle.However, as soon as Mike figures out the answer and reads from the book, the text transports him through time and space to the prehistoric era. In order to return home, Mike must jump from one period of history to another to locate mysterious Tetrads. However, Zoda, the antagonist of Mike's previous adventure, is back and hunting for the Tetrads as well.GameplayAs in the original StarTropics, gameplay in Zoda's Revenge is split between two primary modes. In the game's overworld sections, the player, as Mike, must talk to NPCs to gather clues and items to access the game's dungeons levels and other secrets. In the dungeons, the game takes on an overhead perspective, with Mike defeating enemies and hopping on tiles to trigger doors and find items and power-ups.Instead of a yo-yo, this time around, Mike earns a series of progressively powerful weapons as he travels through time, ranging from a stone axe to a dagger and swords. He also learns to use psychic attacks.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5570">Alundra</game><game id="11829">Alundra 2</game><game id="6243">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</game><game id="9522">The Legend of the Mystical Ninja</game><game id="18766">Dark Savior</game><game id="2388">StarTropics</game><game id="11349">Goof Troop</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362642-nes_startropics2zodasrevenge.jpg</image></root>
