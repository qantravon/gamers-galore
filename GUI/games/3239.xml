<root><id>3239</id><name>Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer</name><description>OverviewThe eighth entry of the Might and Magic series continues to use the same engine pioneered with Might and Magic VI. The basic goals would remain the same as a party-based, open world RPG. Players would continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet. At this point, however, the aging engine and the similarity of its gameplay to that of its predecessors would take its toll among critics if not the fans of the series. Recycled elements of the plot and the relatively inferior nature of its design in comparison to its peers at the time were also cited as detriments.In this game, players would take on a party of adventurers tasked with restoring the balance of four elemental points before they converge upon a mysterious crystal summoned by the Planeswalker Escaton. If they fail, the elemental storms sweeping the land of Jadame will become great enough to destroy the entire world. The game would also feature ties to previous titles with its characters and story threads, including those related to the franchise's Heroes series.The Manual was particularly noteworthy for continuing the tradition of providing plenty of expanded fiction encompassing the world of Might and Magic.As was a tradition of the series, a color map showing the land of Jadame was also provided.StoryPrevious games in the series held back the sci-fi aspect of the game until close to the very end when everything would be revealed, but with Mandate of Heaven, this was introduced somewhat from the start. Players unfamiliar with the extensive backstory of the series, however, could ignore the introductory cutscene and dive into the game suspecting nothing and focus only on the introduction provided by the manual.Unlike many of the previous games, however, the plot of Day of the Destroyer was heavily intertwined with the previous titles as well as the Heroes series. Although a deep understanding of each of the games was not necessary to enjoy this chapter, a small element of backstory was required in order to earn a better appreciation for what the story entailed.The game takes place in Jadame, a continent on the world of Enroth which also serves as the "catch-all" setting for Heroes of Might and Magic. According to the backstory of the series, a terrible interstellar war was waged between the Ancients and the Kreegan thousands of years before the start of the game. This war was hinted upon throughout the series, especially from Might and Magic VI onwards. The Kreegan appeared as demonic creatures giving rise to their reputation as devils that would mark the legends of those colony worlds that the Ancients had been forced from during the war.As the Ancients left their descendants upon the colony worlds that they had seeded the void with, the Ancients and their war passed into legend and were soon forgotten. However, unbeknownst to their primitive cousins thousands of years later, they had enacted a policy of destroying those worlds that may be under threat of Kreegan domination which is what brings us to Day of the Destroyer. Although the Kreegans were soundly defeated in Might and Magic VI, Heroes of Might and Magic III and its expansions, and Might and Magic VII, it did not deactivate this program of annihilation that had started when they first invaded.The world of Enroth has fallen out of balance with the rest of the cosmos and as a result, the gateways to the raw energies of the elemental planes course throughout the world threatening its destruction. As a novice mercenary hired to guard Dark Elven merchants, the player's first concern will be to escape the Dagger Wound Islands and make their way to the continent of Jadame.But this had all begun with a visit to the monsterous town of Ravenshore by a mysterious, humanoid figure whose appearance stood in stark contrast to the creatures that surrounded him. He was attacked by those eager for blood only to find themselves thrown back by an invisible and mysterious field of power that surrounded him. When he reached the center square, he inscribed a circle onto the ground and a titanic crystal erupted from it engulfing him. Creatures approached the crystal and were thrown back, but almost as if in response, a wave of power erupted from the relic searching out the corners of the continent of Jadame. Four elemental gateways were torn open.Near the Dagger Wound Islands, a gate to the elemental plane of Earth exploded open with billowing clouds of searing volcanic ash and molten rock raining down upon them. At the opposite corner of Jadame, a great deluge erupted from the Water gateway that sent a Minotaur lair under water. Minotaur society was broken by the event leaving one of their most important homes underwater.In another corner of Jadame, a wall of terrible fire exploded from the gateway that tore itself open there, burning the desert itself and sending the nearby Trolls fleeing in terror from the storm. And above an ancient forest, a gateway to Air was opened tearing old trees from their very roots and flinging them into the sky, swallowing them whole. The elemental powers were unshackled as the forces from all four gates soon made their way towards the mysterious crystal.A long forgotten Dark Elven prophecy had predicted this cycle of destruction, saying:"A tyme of stryfe and woe shall follow the 'Aege of Shefar' and in this Aege, all shall fall to naught as the gates of chaos are opened unto Enroth. And this shall be a sygn unto ye- when the elemental forces of the Earth, the Wind, and Fyre, and the Water shall freely roam your lands to usher death and destruction upon theyr wings, ye shall have entered the fynale Aege, 'the Aege of Purification.' Once this Aege hath begun, there shalt be no recourse. For lo' the lords of the Earth, the Wind, the Fyre, and the Water both giveth lyfe unto thee and stryketh lyfe from thee. In tymes of stryfe the cycle of destruction cannot be avoided and thyne only repose shall be death. However, in tymes of harmony those that gather in allyance shall stand the possibility of surviving the purification and warding off the end of the 'Aege of Shefar' to enjoy a prolonged era of peace."What none know is that the mysterious figure is a being called the Planeswalker Escaton and he has come to fulfill the Ancients' plans to purge the world so that it may never fall into the hands of the Kreegan.The adventure starts in the Dagger Wound Islands as the party of characters, with the leader acknowledged as the "Champion of Jadame", protect merchants and fend off pirates. They eventually make their way to Ravenshore, the capital of Jadame, informing the Merchant Guild of the coming cataclysm. But more evidence is required so the party is asked convince the smuggling ring in the city to help gather information for them.Eventually, they are led to the Ironsand Desert where, after several quests, return to the city of Alvar where the doomsday prophecy is discovered and explained. The factions of Jadame must stand together against this threat. Unfortunately for the party, many of the factions are at war with each other. After many more adventures, the party manage to unite many of the factions together and go forth to defeat a pirate fleet preventing the return of King Roland and his wife, Catherine, who have pledged their assistance. Xanthor, the sage that has come with them, fashioned a key allowing the party to enter Escaton's crystal but must use Heartstones within each of the four elemental planes.Once they have done this, Xanthor completes the key allowing them to enter the crystal wherein they battle creatures formed from its magic. It is a place of utter chaos with many party members falling prey to the insanity that being there entails, but they persevere and discover that Escaton has imprisoned the four lords of the elemental planes. The party must answer three riddles to gain the keys to their cells and when they do so, free the imprisoned lords and rebalance the elements as they go to soothe their subjects. The four elemental lords then turn their attentions against the crystal and destroy it.Ravenshore, and all of Jadame, are saved, but Escaton's defeat at the end leaves a mysterious thread open as he lies dying. A small pod on his chest opens up and turns into a mechanical spider and Escaton turns his half ravaged face at it, the torn open flesh revealing torn electronics and glowing pathways beneath his skin revealing that he may be but a mechanism created by the Ancients. He tells the spider to "Tell them I have failed."GameplayMM8 continues to use the engine developed with MM6 ( Mandate of Heaven) which allows for a free roaming movement system providing complete 360Â° range of maneuverability similar to that found in titles such as Elder Scrolls: Arena or Daggerfall. It would also use 3D graphics to render the environment of its world although it would also use them in conjunction with animated 2D sprites representing monsters and special effects among other assets. It would also use an extensive number of cut-scenes utilizing rendered FMVs utilizing 3D graphics.Players were called upon to create a five character party and depending on which class is chosen, they will start with two preset skills with the player free to pick two extra starting skills alongside the available options depending on the character's class. Though each character only starts with four skills, they can always learn any other skills allowed by their class from teachers spread throughout the land.MM8 had overhauled its classes in an attempt to refresh the design. The seven classes available are Knight, Cleric, Necromancer, Dark Elf, Troll, Vampire, and Minotaur, with each being able to eventually perform epic quests to be promoted to greater versions of their starting class. For example, a Knight can earn a quest promotion to become a Champion. Unlike its predecessor, Might and Magic VII, alignment-based classes were thrown out leaving only one promotable direction for each class.The first set of skills is weapon skills, including Staff, Sword, Dagger, Axe, Spear, Bow, Mace, and Unarmed. Next there are the armor skills, consisting of Leather, Chain, Plate, and Shield. The various schools of magic are Fire Air, Water, Earth, Spirit, Body, Mind, Light, and Dark. The promotion system also establishes the level of expertise that each character has with each spell and proceeds from Novice, Expert, Master, and finally to Grand Master.Finally there are the miscellaneous skills, denoting all skills which do not fit into any other category: Identify, Merchant, Repair, Bodybuilding, Meditation, Perception, Diplomacy, Disarm Trap, and Learning among others. With all skills, characters may eventually find teachers who can teach an upgrade to Expert, Master, and then ultimately, to Grandmaster although this last is far more specific to certain classes. For example, a Knight cannot become a Dodging Grandmaster.Party members could also be dismissed, hired, or re-hired at any time.The game is open-ended meaning that upon completing the main quest, the party is free to explore the rest of the continent for anything else that they may have missed. They can meet with the key figures of the land, such as King Roland and the Merchant's Guild, and receive their adulation for helping to save the world.GraphicsMight and Magic VIII uses the same engine as its predecessor but with support for 3D acceleration which improves the graphical effects in the environment. Such effects are primitive by today's standards but are better than the 2D sprites used in Might and Magic VI.TimeTime is also an important consideration in the game as day and night cycles pass offering new opportunities or in making things more difficult depending on where they are. Several quests in the game are also tied to their own schedule meaning that when an NPC says that they are giving a month to complete a quest, they mean it. This can also determine when the safest time might be for the party to rest and recoup their strength if they are out in the wilderness.StatisticsThe statistics for each character are limited only by the number of levels that they may earn, among other factors such as magical effects, allowing for tremendously high numbers that break the typical "18" cap. However, if any statistic drops to 0, it will result in immediate death for that character.The basic statistics used in the game seem derived from the Dungeons and Dragons model of statistics, although carry different names so as to differentiate themselves. They are:Intellect - General knowledge. Important to sorcerers as it can affect spell points. Important to archers later on at higher levels as they begin learning sorcerer spells.Might - Raw strength. Important to any fighting class such as Knights and Paladins. Affects the damage a character can inflict in melee combat.Personality - A character's general degree of appeal to others. Particularly important to clerics as it affects their pool of spell points. Important to paladins when, at higher levels, they begin learning cleric spells.Endurance - Stamina. Affects how many hit points a character initially has to start with and will gain every time they level. Particularly important to fighters.Speed - Agility and general quickness affecting initiative. A faster character improves (increases) their Armor Class rating making them harder to hit.Accuracy - A character's ability to land hits during combat. This is particularly important to archers.Luck - Measures the general chances of a character succeeding when all else seems to have failed. Random and unpredictable.ClassesClasses had undergone several changes by including race oriented ones such as "Troll" and eliminating others such as Sorcerer and Monk. Race is not a choice the player can make in creating their character. This is determined by what class they select for them.Knights are the workhorses of the fighting class, coming onto the scene with the largest selection of weapons and armor; in fact, they are able to eventually learn any and all weapon and armor skills. Knights begin with the greatest number of hit points of any class and gain the most hit points when they advance in level. Knights can be promoted to Cavalier status (gaining two hit points per level) and again to become an all-out Champion (gaining another two hit points per level). Being the quintessential warriors, knights have no mind for magic, and so may never learn spells or the Meditation skill.Clerics are adventurous, spell-casting holy men who are mediocre fighters. Their magic is most powerful in the areas of healing and defense. Clerics can learn from the mirrored paths of the Light and Dark magics, and the awesome spells available in those realms. For weapons, however, Clerics can only choose the mace, staff, or bow, though they are able to learn all armor skills except for Plate. With much diligence and study, Clerics can ascend to Priest (gaining one hit point and spell point per level), and eventually Priest of the Sun (gaining another spell point and an extra hit point).Necromancers are the closest thing to a pure spellcaster on the continent of Jadame. They have succumbed to the temptations of the dark arts making them a specialist in the Dark art as well as a master of the undead. They are also poor physical fighters and are heavily restricted in what armor and weaponry they are allowed to wield. But to make up for it, they can also command Air, Water, Earth, and Fire to do their bidding. With much spell casting experience, Necromancers can be transformed into undead Liches at the highest levels of mastery.Trolls are brute fighters of exceptional endurance and are the most physically tough of all classes. They can also regenerate wounds. They can also use all weapons (although they can gain grandmastery with blunt weeapons such as macess) but are limited to light armors such as leather. They cannot learn any spellcasting abilities. Trolls that survive many battles can eventually graduate to become War Trolls which are truly feared on the battlefield.Minotaurs have descended from magically attuned guardians. Like the Troll, they are powerful warriors but do not have the ability to regenerate their damage. Despite not being able to match the Troll's extreme endurance, they can make up for that lack with strength, cunning, and a limited ability to use magic. All weapons are available to their expertise along with every armor type aside from helmets and shields. With experience and valor, they may even find themselves worthy of promotion to Minotaur Lord.Dark Elf are a race of elves that had long ago decided to follow the darker paths of enlightenment, ability, and magical power. The race is as equally adept at the warring arts as they are with arcane secrets; capable swordsmen and archers as well as wielders of elemental power. Given their darker natures, they also excel at Disarm Traps and Merchant skills, though they cannot use Dark magic. They can only wield spears and axes and are limited to chain armor. Should they pass the required tests, they may even find themselves promoted to Patriarch.Vampires are those that have chosen to revel in the powers granted to them with this class. In addition to their racial abilities, Vampires become powerful workers of Body, Mind, and Spirit magic and can grain great skill with bladed weapons. They are, however, limited in their choice of weapons and armor and being undead creatures, suffer the same penalties that others such things do. With enough power at their command, they can become Nosferatu and earn the ability to even turn into mist.Dragon is not available to a starting character, but once one joins the party, reveals itself as the most powerful of beasts. They can breathe fire, fight with their massive claws and fangs, fly, and even repel most weapons with their scales. They don't use armor and weapons for obvious reasons. With greater experience, wisdom, and cunning, Dragons can become deadly Great Wyrms of devastating power and prestige.SkillsEach character starts out with a set of four skills and can learn whatever else they wish throughout the game as long as they can pay for the lessons. Skill levels can be improved through a combination of of promotions to their class and then finding the appropriate teacher to earn a higher skill level. In addition, the skill system has been altered from the previous game so that certain classes can only learn certain levels of skills and a new level of Mastery (Grandmaster) for each skill. A similar thing also changed with the magic system where a character could only learn a spell if they had the mastery. For example, only a character with an appropriately promoted Thief class (such as an Assassin) could become Grandmasters of the Dagger.Weapon SkillsThese are required to wield particular weapons. Without the appropriate skill, a character cannot equip specific weapons.Staffs are two-handed poles equally good for offense and defense. Expert ranking with the staff will increase the character's armor class and Master ranking will allow them to occasionally stun their opponents. Grandmasters can use a staff in conjunction with their Unarmed skill becoming even deadlier in battle.Sword skill covers most types of blades longer than a knife. Expert swordsmen gain a quicker attack while Master swordsmen may wield any one-handed sword in their left hand and another weapon in their right. Grandmasters add their skill level to their armor class.Daggers don't do the kind of damage that a sword or an axe can deliver, but their quick attacks can sometimes let a character get in two slices for every one move made by a slower opponent. Expert dagger fighters can wield a dagger in their left hand while using another weapon in their right. Master dagger fighters have a chance of killing a surprised opponent with a single blow. Grandmasters add 1 point of skill to the damage done.Axes are rather slow on the attack, but do a lot of damage when they hit. Expert axe fighters gain more speed in their attacks while Master axe fighters can deliver tremendous damage. Grand Masters can even halve the armor class of their opponents inflicting even worse damage to their foes.Spears make their point by including all pole weapons with blades attached to the business end. Versatile, they can be used one- or two-handed, but they work better with two hands. Expert ranking with the spear will increase a character's armor class, and Master ranking will boost damage caused. Grandmasters can also use their level to add to their defensive bonus.Bow skill targets both bows and crossbows. Expert marksmen gain a speed increase with their weapon, while Masters fire two arrows with every attack with Grandmasters adding their level of skill to the damage caused.Mace skill covers all blunt trauma weapons: batons, flails, the general whack-in-the-head arsenal. Expert mace swingers do extra damage with their weapons, while Masters and Grandmasters can stun opponents.Unarmed is applied when a character has no equipped weapon and have only their fists to defend themselves with. At the normal level of expertise, the skill level is added to the attack bonus. Experts can then add it to their attack damage. As a Master, it will affect the attack bonus and the damage inflicted. And Grandmasters gain a percentage based on their skill level to completely avoid attacks.Armor SkillsNote: all armor types (not counting shield) carry a penalty by slowing down a character; Master and Expert kill in armor reduces this drag while the Grandmaster levels add powerful bonuses to their use.Leather armor is the lightest armor available. Providing less protection than chain or plate armor, it also slows a character down the least.Chain armor provides more protection than leather and less than plate; thus, it also slows a character down more than leather.Plate armor delivers the most gong for your gold: it affords the most protection, it also the greatest reduction in speed.Shield skill directly improves a character's armor class while a shield is equipped. Expert and Master shield ranking increase this defensive bonus.Magic SkillsNote: Expert and Master ranks in the various Magic skills have different effects for each individual spell of that Magic school and Grandmaster levels of these spell schools grant devastating bonuses.Fire magic is a good way to burn a bad guy, and also includes sells having to do with speed and pain.Air magic tends to be defensive and informational in nature, and includes spells of accuracy and flight.Water magic is equally useful for defense and offense, and concentrates on spells that move or change things.Earth magic is defensive and includes spells that protect, bind, and strengthen.Spirit magic concentrates on spells of life and death. Live forever, bring back the dead, slow or accelerate aging.Body magic cures disease, dissolves poisons, and generally heals and enchants.Mind magic chars and confuses.Light magic includes some of the strongest spells in the land. Light magic cannot be chosen by beginning characters; it must be learned and mastered during your travels.Dark magic comprises some of the most powerful magic in Enroth. Spells of darkness can have spectacular results, but generally carry a price. Dark magic cannot be chosen by beginning characters; it must be coveted and invoked during your travels.Miscellaneous SkillsIdentify Item gives meaning to items and equipment; you can't use something until you know what it is! This skill will automatically identify an item if your character's skill level is high enough. Special items may need an Expert or Master in this skill to properly identify them. Grandmasters have seen everything and can deduce what an item is blindfolded.Identify Monster allows a character to correctly assess just what it is they are fighting. At higher levels, they will learn more about their quarry such as how many hit points they have and, at Grandmaster, can determine a monster's spell ability, resistances, and attack qualities at a glance.Merchant skill helps adjust prices in your favor, whether buying or selling. Remember: buy low, sell high.Repair skill allows your characters to fix broken equipment. The higher the skill level, the better the quality of item your character can play handyman on. Expert and master rankings allow characters to repair complex items and artifacts.Bodybuilding skill pumps your character up, adding hit points directly to totals.Meditation adds spell points directly to your relaxed character's totals.Perception sharpens your character's chance of noticing a trap: catch it in time, and the damage it causes can be reduced or even avoided. A higher perception skill equals a chance to escape stronger escapes; Expert and Master rankings allow a character to notice and escape different types of traps.Armsmaster increases a character's skill across their weapon abilities. Normal level reduces the time it takes to strike again, Experts and Masters add their skill levels to their damage, and Grand Masters double their previous bonuses.Disarm Trap skill is the perfect thing for when you can't remember where you left your keys: all chests will open automatically, but you may get hit by a trap. The more skill you have, the better your chance to disarm any trap before it goes off.Learning skill increases the experience your character receives. Every rank of skill increases the experience bonus your character receives. Experts double and Masters triple this bonus; learn enough to do the math and you'll see how this can add to your advantage.SpellsEach of the various schools of magic have their own unique spells. Spells can have all types of wildly varying effects, from simply lighting a dark hallway to calling down a cataclysmic storm of meteors on everybody in the vicinity! Here is a list of all the spells arranged by school, with descriptions of their effects and the bonus gained from Expert and Master ranking in the relevant Magic skill.With the improvements made to the skill levels of the classes involved, spells have also been divided into sections available only to those expert enough to gain access to them.Fire SpellsNormal Level SpellsTorch Light produces a sphere of light around your party.

Experts' recovery time is cut somewhat, while Masters take just a quick breather between spells.Grand Master Level SpellIncinerate is one of the strongest direct damage spells you may acquire, inflicting massive damage on a single target.

Masters are back at it faster with 5 shots.Ice Bolt fires a single bolt of ice at a single target. Always a hit, it does moderate cold damage: 1 - 7 points of damage per skill rank. Cost is 8.

Cost is 8 spell points and requires recovery. Damage is 1 - 5 points for every skill rank.Stone to Flesh, if cast in time, removes tthe curse of being turned to stone from a character. The caster's skill and rank in Earth magic determine how long the dire condition can be present before the spell loses effectiveness. After that, the only way to remove the condition short of Divine Intervention is to visit a temple.Master Level SpellsRock Blast releases a magical stone into the world, a stone that will explode either when it comes into contact with a creature or when enough time passes, causing damage in a radius of 20 feet.
