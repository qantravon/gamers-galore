Several Modders got together and made their own team.  For the Glory is a remade version of EU2. It mostly has the same features with a few improvements in some area's. However the main improvement is in the fact they modified the engine as much as possible to make more features possible for modification. 2 Mods were available at launch. One from the team with over 10,000 Historical Events. and the other sent the time line back slightly.  There are many others in the works as well which will feature new maps, events and gameplay modifiers.  System Requirements Processor: Pentium III with 800 MHzMemory: 128 MB RAMHard Drive: 1 GB of free hard drive spaceVideo Card: 4 MB DirectX-compatible video cardSound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20509">Empire: Total War</game><game id="19887">Rome: Total War</game><game id="19641">Medieval: Total War</game><game id="8407">Shogun: Total War</game><game id="2875">Knights of Honor</game><game id="18049">Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun</game><game id="5427">Patrician III</game><game id="16457">Sid Meier's Civilization IV</game><game id="3750">Sid Meier's Civilization</game><game id="217">Sid Meier's Civilization II</game><game id="1594">Sid Meier's Civilization III</game><game id="8349">Hearts of Iron</game><game id="8078">Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday</game><game id="13613">Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday - Armageddon</game><game id="4866">Hearts of Iron II</game><game id="23460">Hearts of Iron III</game><game id="5829">Hearts of Iron Anthology</game><game id="30948">Rise of Prussia</game><game id="4686">Waterloo: Napoleon's Last Battle</game><game id="39594">March of the Eagles</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331108-box_euftg.png</image></root>
