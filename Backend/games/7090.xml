Much like professional martial arts bouts, the player character can score hits on the opponent should they get past their defenses. These blows either take away half a hit point or an entire hit point, depending on where it landed. Should all pf the opponent's health be deducted, they are knocked out and the player character moves onto the next fight.The game was followed by a sequel, Fuuun Shaolin Kyo: Ankoku no Maou.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15480">Yie Ar Kung-Fu</game><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game><game id="8260">Fuuun Shaolin Kyo: Ankoku no Maou</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1500157-shaolinkyo_front.jpg</image></root>
