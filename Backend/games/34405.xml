This would include team changes, most notably Valentino Rossi switching from the Yamaha factory team to the Ducati Factory Team. Due to a poor reception and mediocre sales the free updates and DLC have not been added despite the 2011 MotoGP season being complete. This has been a common theme throughout all of Capcom's MotoGP games.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28327">MotoGP 09/10</game><game id="9445">MotoGP '07</game><game id="17274">MotoGP '06</game><game id="17685">MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2421670-box_motogp1011.png</image></root>
