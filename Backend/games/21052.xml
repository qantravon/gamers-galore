The game's story follows Ethan Kairos, a teenager that wakes up on his seventeenth birthday and discovers that his entire world has changed. His parents have disappeared, he lives with his hotheaded uncle, and a mysterious girl named Kori has joined his class at school. Early on, Ethan discovers a device called a Hollow Pen that allows its user to stop time and open a portal to the same location at a different moment in the past. He uses the Hollow Pen with the intent to return the timeline to its original state, but soon finds that someone or something is sabotaging his efforts, hurting his friends and family in the process.GameplayEthan opening up a hole.  Players can create a portal to a different time in the current location. Whilst the portal is open, everything and everybody stop moving except for those who posses a Hollow Pen.In the game, flashbacks appear whenever the past is altered. Ethan can use the Hollow Pen in the location of the flashback once the description, location and time of the place of the event is known.Once the portal is open, players can interact with the past. For example, players can take a letter from the future, and put it in the past where someone important will stumble across it. Closing the portal consolidates the changes that have been made, which will in turn change the present.However, players can only use the hollow pen a certain number of times a day. When its charges (described in the game as the user's 'Time') run out, Ethan collapses and the game is essentially over. Time can be regained by finding Ethan's pet cat, Sox.FlashbacksEvery time players have a flashback, necessary information can be found by talking to characters, going to the library, or visiting locations. Once enough information has been obtained, Ethan can then use the hollow pen on the location, then modify the past. If the change is incorrect, the same flashbacks will appear, and the portal will have to be opened again. Once the correct changes have been made, the story will move forward with reality reflecting the changes that have been made.CharactersEthan Kairos: The protagonist and holder of the Hollow Pen.Sox: Ethan's pet cat.Timothy Kairos: Ethan's father and previous holder of the Hollow Pen.Pamela Kairos: Ethan's mother.Derek Karios: Ethan's uncle and Timothy's brother.
