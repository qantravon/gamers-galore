<root><id>26559</id><name>Metroid Prime Trilogy</name><description>OverviewMetroid Prime Trilogy is a single-disc compilation for the Nintendo Wii consisting of Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. The first two games in the series, originally released for the Nintendo GameCube, have been updated with 480p widescreen support, improved graphic effects, and motion controls similar to those found in Metroid Prime 3. The games have also been updated to include Metroid Prime 3's achievement system, which allows players to earn colored tokens used to unlock bonus materials. All three games are available to play from the start.The compilation was released as a Collector's Edition only. The North American version was packaged in a special metal case with a plastic sleeve while the European and Australian version came in a regular Wii game case with a cardboard slip case. The game also came with a small pamphlet of concept art that contained a summary of the trilogy's story. Nintendo went with a compilation in Western territories instead of the separate releases of the original Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 as New Play Control editions previously released in Japan.Nintendo of America discontinued Metroid Prime Trilogy on January 8th, 2010; less than half a year after the compilation was released. Nintendo of Australia followed suit on January 11th.GameplayMetroid Prime Trilogy adopts the control system from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and modifies them for the original two Metroid Prime games for the Wii. Using this control method, the player points at the screen with the Wii Remote and moves Samus with the Nunchuck. The biggest difference between the revised controls for the first two games and those for Metroid Prime 3 is that the Minus Button switches between visors, rather than entering Hyper Mode. Another key element is that the Spring Ball has been added for use in both of the original Metroid Prime games. This function is control by simply flicking the Wii Remote upward while Samus is in her morph ball form.MultiplayerThe four-player split-screen competitive multiplayer mode that appeared in Metroid Prime 2 is also included in its Wii incarnation. Because Metroid Prime Trilogy does not include the front-end menus of the stand-alone editions of the games, the mode is accessed from the main menu. Like the original version of the mode included in Metroid Prime 2, the multiplayer is limited to local four-player and does not feature online play.Changes from the OriginalsIn addition to adding 16:9 widescreen support and Wiimote and Nunchuck controls to the original Prime games, there are a few additional changes that should be noted for this compilation.There is a unified game menu, meaning the original menu themes are only accessible in the unlockables section.Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 have two selectable difficulties from the start instead of one.Like Metroid Prime 3, performing specific actions in the GameCube Metroid Prime games will earn the player tokens which can be used to unlock items in the Unlockables section.Sequence breaking in Metroid Prime has been changed to reflect the Players' Choice version of the game. Many breaks were removed while some are significantly harder to pull off like getting the Space Jump Boots first.The Fusion Suit, originally a Game Boy Advance link-up feature unlocked when connecting Metroid Prime to the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion can now be unlocked in the Unlockables section. It cannot be used in Metroid Prime 2 or 3.The special cannon effects (i.e. ice freezing over the cannon while charging the Ice Beam) and water splash effects in Metroid Prime have been removed. This was later explained as necessary because the original effects were only possible because of the static gun arm. With the Wii version offering motion controls that move the arm cannon analogous to the player's aiming movements, the effects were no longer working properly and thus had to be removed.In Metroid Prime 3, the word "damn" has been removed from an in-game cutscene and replaced with "No!"In Metroid Prime 3, a swinging gate in Elysia has been replaced with an energy field (Note: This energy field appeared in the European version of Metroid Prime 3). No explanation was given.Save FilesSave files from the standard edition of Metroid Prime 3 and Gamecube memory cards containing Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 game data are not compatible with the Trilogy versions of the games.SoundtrackMetroid PrimeTrack # Track name Size Length (mins)01 Title Theme 2.61 mb 2:1302 Menu Theme 3.01 mb 2:3403 Prologue Intro Theme 1.96 mb 1:3904 Samus Intro Fanfare 0.26 mb 0:0905 Deserted Frigate Orpheon 2.19 mb 1:5106 Desolate Frigate Orpheon 4.97 mb 4:1707 Item Acquisition Fanfare 0.23 mb 0:0808 Parasite Queen Boss Theme 3.41 mb 2:5509 Evacuate!
