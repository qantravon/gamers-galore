<root><id>29178</id><name>Domino Rally</name><description>OverviewDomino Rally is a game for the Nintendo Wii in which players take on the role of Minon, a hero who arrives on the scene when people desperately need someone to aid them. Using deliberately low polygon cutscenes reminiscent of games such as Katamari Damacy, Minon's help is requested under a number of bizarre circumstances. Once he agrees to help, Minon becomes the appropriate size and then solves the problems by creating and improvising pathways using dominos and other objects that topple in a similar manner. Originally released in Japan in 2007, Domino Rally was then subsequently published in localized editions in 2009 for the European (under the title Minon Everyday Hero) and North American markets.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13325">No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</game><game id="13795">Pepsiman</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2525000-dominorally.jpg</image></root>
