As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a "gachapon" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts.The game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop's Virtual Console.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4152">Military Madness</game><game id="2177">Famicom Wars</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2384526-sd_gundam_gachapon_2_fc.jpg</image></root>
