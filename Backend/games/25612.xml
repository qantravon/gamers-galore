Players can earn money working jobs fixing and modding cars at the workshop, which they can spend on outfitting their own car, from changing tyres to installing tubochargers to welding on new bodykits. Touch Mechanic takes advantage of the Nintendo DS touch screen allowing you to use the stylus to saw, sand, screw, spray, drill, weld and hammer your way to becoming a professional racing mechanic.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/935569-front_cover.jpg</image></root>
