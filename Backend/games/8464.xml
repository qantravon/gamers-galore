The game plays out in six small mini-games which form and support the overall story arc of the game of liberating an island of its newest oppressor, the dictator. The mini games all involve some sort of military theme and / or craft and the gameplay follows basic arcade tropes, involving shoot em ups and careful maneuvering.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="1214">Beach Head 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1270/815343-beach_headcover.jpg</image></root>
