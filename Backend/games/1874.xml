You are the pilot of a F6F Hellcat aboard the USS Wasp, a U.S Navy multipurpose amphibious assault ship. Your goal is to destroy the Japanese forces, that are nested on small islands. The Japanese forces have different means to destroy you: bunkers, turrets, barracks and foot soldiers. The Japanese also have air carriers, destroyers and battleships to aid them. The player is given a choice of three types of load-out before leaving the USS Wasp: bombs, rockets or torpedoes. The player also has to have an eye on his own ship as the Japanese will attack that as well as you. Your own carrier also serves as a means to refuel your craft and replenish your ammo.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12114">Jetstrike</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7900/277323-wings_of_fury.jpg</image></root>
