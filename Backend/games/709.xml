Characters can learn new spells and techniques mid-fight but cannot level up in the middle of a battle. Though very crude looking now, the game's graphics were considered to be impressive back in 1996 when it was released. There are three different types of battle in the game: The standard kill everything type. where the battle will not end until every enemy unit on the map has been defeated.The kill the target unit type. The battle ends when the player is successful in defeating/destroying a certain enemy.The A to B type. The main characters must fight their way to the exit, usually chased by enemy reinforcements.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20113">Shining Force</game><game id="14528">Shining Force II</game><game id="8306">Shining Force III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1666814-mystaria_the_realms_of_lore_box_front.jpg</image></root>
