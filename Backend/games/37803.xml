Rather than start at the dawn of the automotive era, the game begins in a Post World War 2 era setting and focuses on bringing modern engines, platforms and automotive concepts to market through the year 2020.Game Play DetailsGame play is divided into three sections; the engine designer, car designer and company management. Players will have the ability to create a wide range of engine styles - from economic 3-cylinder engines to turbocharged 12-cylinder race motors, and nearly everything in between and mate them to a sophisticated car design tool which allows for the creation of nearly endless car and truck platforms.Engine Layouts included at launchInline 3, 4, 5 and 6V6, V8, V10, V12Flat 4, Flat 6Aspiration included at launchNaturally AspiratedSingle TurboTwin TurboSuperchargerCar Building features included at launchEngine placement at front, middle and rearfront wheel drive, rear wheel drive, all wheel drive3,4,5,6-speed transmissions with and without synchrovaried clutch and differential typesInterior customizationvaried vehicle types; sports cars, family cars, trucks (with car shape manipulation)platform creation with model-specific variants (i.e. chrome vents on a deluxe version)Company Management features included at launchManage imports, exports of parts and suppliesManage a network of factories and dealershipsResearch new parts, buy expanded manufacturing capabilitiesMarket and Sell your cars, gain a company reputationPlay against AI Car companiesMultiplayer with co-opDevelopmentDevelopment of the title is actively underway with the developers at Camshaft Software offering frequent updates and a livestream of the process.
