Originally the free release was a "concept" version for the full game Gran Turismo  HD, this was the first concept version released outside of Japan. Gran Turismo HD was released with 10 cars including Ferarris which was a first for the series, and one track The Eiger Nordwand (including reverse track ) which is in the Swiss Alps. The game featured Time Trial and Drift Trial modes and also had regional leaderboards. GTHD planned to have a digital store for the purchase of cars that would later be usable in Gran Turismo 5, however shortly after releasing the game in Europe the full version was cancelled in order for Polyphony Digital to focus on development of Gran Turismo 5. Gran Turismo HD remains available along side GT5: Prologue in North America, but was pulled from the Playstation Store in Japan on September 30th , 2007.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6978">Enthusia Professional Racing</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/880/251013-gran_turismo_hd_concept_cover.png</image></root>
