<root><id>12208</id><name>WarioWare Twisted!</name><description>WarioWare: Twisted! is the third game in the franchise, and continues the same brand of crazy, fast-paced microgaming as it predecessors. Whereas WarioWare, Inc. used the D-pad and A button though, this installment uses only the built-in motion sensor with the A button. A rumble function is also built into the cartridge, which can be deactivated in the Option menu.The player has to play through a variety of microgames, which generally last around a few second each. The fun comes when these games are strung together in quick succession. The games are divided up into sets for each character, and each set has a Boss Stage, which generally lasts a little longer than standard ones. Completing a character's boss lets you move on through the story.The player also has the option to play a single microgame on endless loop like an independent stage. Beating a preset high score clears the game, as indicated by a crown.Story(Chronologically, this game takes place between  WarioWare Inc. and  WarioWare Touched!)Wario is playing on his  GBA. When he gets frustrated by the game he's playing, he throws it around and ends up breaking the system. Wario takes the busted system to Crygor, who throws in in one of his crazy inventions. The result is a system that has no buttons, but Wario discovers that the games are played by tilting it. Showing the new motion sensitive system to Mona and 9-Volt, he is once again inspired to sell them and make himself some cash.Character StoriesAfter each story (except Wario-Man's), the character makes their way to Club Sugar and appears on the dance floor. The epilogues are viewable in the Options after seeing them in the story.Wario: While Wario is working out, a mouse knocks him over. Wario chases it around his house, and in doing so disturbs a large stopwatch. Although he catches the mouse, the watch flies into the air and then lands on him, trapping him inside (which gives the watch a Wario-like mustache...). The watch opens up and four tiny Warios walk out, and the mouse chases after them. They dash back into the watch and a full-sized Wario pops back out, who kicks the watch at the mouse. It misses, but then bounces around the other room and and then lands on the mouse.Mona: Mona Pizza and Pizza Dinosaur - next-door to each other - both get a phone call. Mona gets an order, but Pizza Dinosaur's caller had the wrong number (they wanted Mona). So, naturally, they head out after Mona while she's out to deliver a pizza and ambush her on the bridge. Mona's three animal friends arrive to help her, but Pizza Dinosaur has a large dinosaur-styled armoured vehicle which is resistant to their attacks. Mona's monkey friend drops a banana on the road, which trips up the Pizza Dinosaur vehicle, allowing Mona to deliver the pizza successfully.Jimmy: Jimmy is once again setting the dance floor on fire, but this time, he's joined by his parents. Dinner is brought to the trio, but they're too busy taking snapshots with their cell phones to eat it.Kat  Ana: Kat and Ana are on a school field trip to Diamond Knoll. While they're walking along, Ana stops to look at a flower, but Kat keeps on walking. When Ana rushes to catch up, she finds Kat prodding a beehive with a stick. Of course, the bees get angry, so the girls run into a shack up ahead and shut the door. Then, a sinister monster appears in the darkness... Kat and Ana begin to charge up their swords with massive power, when Shuriken the hawk (carrying Shadow the dog) flies in through a window, and crashes into the monster, knocking it out. As the girls leave they discover that the bees have been waiting outside. The stage ends with them running from the angry bees.Dribble  Spitz: Dribble and Spitz are driving along down Interstate 310. Spitz is asleep, and Dribble is messing with the radio. All of a sudden, the cab breaks down, so the duo get to work trying to fix it.  Once the cab is fixed, they continue on their way. Dribble presses a small button on the dashboard, and the cab sprouts wings and takes off into outer space. Along their new route, they find an alien customer who wishes to go to Club Sugar.Dr. Crygor: At his off-shore laboratory, Dr. Crygor has completed his latest creation. The Gravitator is capable of altering gravity itself. The machine spits out a massive robotic suit, which Crygor uses to fly up in the skies... until Shuriken hits it. Fortunately, the hawk rescues Crygor as his suit falls to pieces, and gets him safely to solid ground.Orbulon: Orbulon is flying through space in his pig-shaped spaceship, manned by his bunny minions. Leaving them in charge, he falls asleep, but soon they follow him. They all wake up suddenly when the ship's computer warns them about a black hole about to destroy them. Orbulon activates the Warp Mode, but can't remember the password... Orbulon finally gets the password and the ship speeds away. They come across a moon and decide to land and rest, but the moon turns out to be a creature that eats the ship and spits it out towards earth.9-Volt: 9-Volt's class has a new student: 18-Volt (no relation to 9-Volt), who's into music. 9-Volt decides to invite the new guy over, who's fascinated by all of 9-Volt's retro games and systems. They plug in the NES and play some old-school games together. 9-Volt's mother storms upstairs and tells him to get to bed. Like any gamer, he tries playing on his GBA SP after she's left the room, but she catches him in the act.Wario-Man: The news is reporting that Wario's latest game has once again broken sales records. At Crygor's lab, a conveyor belt carries items to the Gravitator to convert into the game. Wario is sitting on the belt engrossed in his own game and falls into the machine, which spits him out as... WARIO-MAN! Dedicated to saving the world from it's money. Dr. Crygor throws Wario-Man back into the Gravitator, but he uses it to "power up." The contraption takes off into space, where it transforms into a colossal robot suit.ConclusionMona, 9-Volt, 18-Volt, Kat and Ana are seeing space from Orbulon's new spaceship. Wario-Man, still wearing his new suit, sees them and starts waving at them. Unfortunately the ship decides that he is a threat, and despite his cries of alarm, shoots Wario's suit to pieces, leaving him to fall back down to earth. He lands in the ocean near Dr. Crygor's lab, and claims that he is firing everyone. After the cast credits have rolled, one of the handheld systems fall back down into the ocean and Wario bobs back to the surface.Post-Story Remix ModesAfter the story mode, there several unlockable remix modes which mix all of the microgames together.
