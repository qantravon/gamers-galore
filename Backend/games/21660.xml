Unlike Super Bases Loaded, which was based on the first Super Professional Baseball, this game is instead based on a separate Jaleco baseball game Super 3D Baseball - a baseball sim that experiments with a 3D viewpoint, made possible with the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 graphics and a special DSP chip included in the cart. Jaleco's Super Professional Baseball II, the sequel to the first Super Bases Loaded, did not receive a US counterpart.As with previous Bases Loaded games, the team names and logos are fictionalized but use actual American cities involved in MLB. </description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4376">Base Wars - Cyber Stadium Series</game><game id="25171">Legends of the Diamond</game><game id="25267">Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3</game><game id="23470">Home Run King</game><game id="44224">Super Professional Baseball II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2134074-sbl2.jpg</image></root>
