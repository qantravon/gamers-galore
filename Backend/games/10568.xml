However, the train   is attacked by a monster, who kills everyone on board   except for the player and a young girl, Naomi. From here on out, the game is pretty much a non-stop chase as the monster pursues the player deeper and deeper   into the underground. Eventually, the player comes across a mysterious underground civilization known as the   Mesh. Â GameplayThe player has no weaponry whatsoever with which to defend themselves, and therefore running is pretty much their only chance of survival-- if the pursuing monster catches the player, it's  game over. As the player delves deeper and deeper into the underground tunnels beneath the city of     Tokyo, he has to try and find shortcuts in order to try and gain more and more terrain over the creature.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30087">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</game><game id="2364">Clock Tower</game><game id="34532">Echo Night</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/86736/1335455-hellnight.jpg</image></root>
