Louie must dodge the thug's attacks while avoiding other enemies, hopping over obstacles, darting under bird droppings, and collecting cans and money. On their quest to get back the dognapped Scraps, the player will encounter the greatest hits of videogame platforming stages. Junkyard to city to forrest to mountain to dessert to snowfield to the final castle. Each level must be completed before the countdown clock reaches zero. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2059531-scrapyard_dog__1990___atari_.jpg</image></root>
