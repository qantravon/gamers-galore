NessBots is a free web game in which you design and code your very own robot!
The game has two playing modes: Single player campaign, in which you must defeat challenges and solve pazzles to advance in levels, and PvP, in which you can fight and compete against other players online! 

This is not just a game - it's a challenge of programming skills and wits against other players!
