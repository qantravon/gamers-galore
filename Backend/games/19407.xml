<root><id>19407</id><name>Kingdom O' Magic</name><description>Kingdom O' Magic is a humorous point and click adventure game featuring a kingdom under threat from a mysterious evil. Similar in content and humor to that of Discworld, Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle.The two main characters in the game are Thydney the Lizard Bloke (John Sessions voices) and Shah-Ron the Girlie (Lani Minella voices) who are tasked with various quests, which take them through various locations, the majority of which are parodies on locations from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, such as Rivendull.The game does feature a combat mechanic, not often seen in point and click adventure games, you must select a spell to use, then the person you wish to use it on, but this often produces unintended, sometimes hilarious results.The game features three different quests, The Good Old Fashioned Traditional Quest, The Magnificent 7-11 Quest, and the Slightly Twisted Quest, each of which presents a higher difficulty level than the previous.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1536">Bored of the Rings</game><game id="18625">The Boggit</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/129539/1816262-kingdom_o_magic_box.jpg</image></root>
