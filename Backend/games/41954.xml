<root><id>41954</id><name>Warlords Battlecry III</name><description>The Campaign is a mixture of an overhead strategic map with real-time gameplay. Departing from the system used in Warlords Battlecry II, which consisted of a Risk-style board with territories, Warlords Battlecry III divides the world of Etheria into numerous locations (mostly cities) that players travel between, with various events at each. Almost all of the map locations have missions to play, some of which are not readily visible until other missions have been completed, as well as shops, academies, and/or mercenaries for hire.</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/6455-1.jpg</image></root>
