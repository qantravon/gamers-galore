Rather than being a visual novel, it is a hack n' slash action game with gameplay similar to the Dynasty Warriors series. It features 6 playable characters, and several campaigns with both retellings of the events of the first Hakuoki game and non-canon "what if" scenarios.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32719">Dynasty Warriors 7</game><game id="27210">Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes</game><game id="43703">MIYAKO ~Tsukiyomi no Yume~</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2417196-box_hwots.png</image></root>
