In addition to containing the typical options of season play and exhibition play, it also includes an edit-a-team mode and Ultra Leagues. In edit mode the player can name their team, choose the uniform colors, name every character, assign their stats, as well as choose from a wide variety of super powers each player may wield. In addition to the Ultra League, there are two leagues of standard baseball teams.Ultra PowersWhen using an Ultra League team (or if the player created their own), each player has access to an Ultra Power (or in the case of pitchers, between two and four Ultra Powers). Each power costs a certain number of Ultra Points to use, between 1 and 9, and provides an extra bit of oomph with which to wallop the opponents. The number of Ultra Points available is set before the game begins, and the player may choose to have unlimited Points.
