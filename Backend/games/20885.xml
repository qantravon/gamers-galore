<root><id>20885</id><name>Pinball</name><description>Overview Pinball was originally released in February 1984 for        Nintendo's       Famicom. It later appeared as "Vs. Pinball" in arcades on the NES-based arcade hardware that the company was using at the time. This arcade release contained different sound effects and some additional features.  The NES version, released in 1985 for the North American launch of the console, would later appear on the Game Boy Advance via the e-Reader peripheral.  The game was also made available as one of the NES titles hidden in      Animal Crossing on the     GameCube and as a download on the    Wii's   Virtual Console service.  Gameplay Pinball consists of a single virtual pinball table.  As in standard pinball, the player controls flippers to bat the pinball toward bumpers and other objects in order to score points.  There is also a bonus area of the table in which the player will temporarily take control of  Mario and move him back and forth across the bottom of the screen to prevent the ball from falling out of the bonus screen.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="11532">Video Pinball</game><game id="18314">Pin*Bot</game><game id="16223">Pinball Quest</game><game id="14033">Extreme Pinball</game><game id="17398">Super Pinball: Behind the Mask</game><game id="15088">Pro Pinball: Big Race USA</game><game id="15961">Rollerball</game><game id="22914">Patriotic Pinball</game><game id="14091">Addiction Pinball</game><game id="7203">David's Midnight Magic</game><game id="7843">Virtual Pinball</game><game id="5436">Metroid Prime Pinball</game><game id="4195">Muppet Pinball Mayhem</game><game id="10265">Pinball Hall of Fame: The Gottlieb Collection</game><game id="24088">Akira Psycho Ball</game><game id="32282">Pinball Yeah!</game><game id="25199">3D Pinball: Space Cadet</game><game id="11311">Austin Powers Pinball</game><game id="33974">Raster Blaster</game><game id="20159">Super Pinball II: The Amazing Odyssey</game><game id="5772">3-D Ultra Pinball: Thrillride</game><game id="1790">Rock 'n Ball</game><game id="40334">Super Pinball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362116-nes_pinball.jpg</image></root>
