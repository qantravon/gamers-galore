Each act has progressive levels of difficulty. For instance, in the diving, the player must land in progressively smaller receptacles, the final part requiring successful navigation into a tea cup!  The controls and player input required change with each act.  The game was released across most 8-bit computer systems. The game was included as part of a bundle on some systems. On the Commodore 64 this came in the form of a 4 game cartridge bundled with later hardware releases. Fiendish Freddy shared the cart with  Klax, International Soccer, and  Flimbo's Quest.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/890896-fiendish_freddy_s_big_top_o__fun___front.jpg</image></root>
