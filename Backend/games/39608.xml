The goal of each stage is to find one of the warps scattered around and fly through it, hopefully to the next stage though there are plenty that simply warp back to the current stage.Defeating opponents, often by ramming into them or shooting them, causes them to be stunned for a few moments and drop a capsule. Shooting these capsules reveal power-ups that range from new weapons, devices like smokescreens and mines that target enemies behind the player and the useful Radar item which highlights the destinations of nearby warps.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21861">Twinbee</game><game id="39936">Flying Hero</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2306730-topple_zip.jpg</image></root>
