It is notable for being one of the first 3D platformers, beating Mario 64 to the market by about a year. Unlike Mario however, Bug! is a very linear game, while you can go any which way you please, most of the game is made up of narrow walkways essentially confining you to a set path, in addition the game is structured much like a linear 2D platform game where Bug has to get from point A to point B, as opposed to the more freeform gameplay of later 3D platformers. The story was also fairly unique in that Bug was a movie star, and the whole scenario was merely a fictitious movie that players were shooting; in other words, none of the characters were ever in any real danger.PC VersionA PC port of Bug!, made by Beam Software, was released in 1996.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game><game id="22804">Sonic X-treme</game><game id="29099">Super Tempo</game><game id="6782">Sonic 3D Blast</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/1035701-bug___u____front.jpg</image></root>
