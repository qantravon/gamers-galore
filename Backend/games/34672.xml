Shadowrun is the third video game to be based off the Shadowrun pen and paper RPG, the previous two games being released on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. The Sega CD game is a mixture of a turn-based battle RPG and an adventure game bearing more resemblance to Konami's Snatcher rather than the previous two Shadowrun games. Because of Shadowrun's late release on the Sega CD it was never released outside Japan.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19250">Shin Megami Tensei</game><game id="3843">Shin Megami Tensei II</game><game id="15090">Policenauts</game><game id="12552">Snatcher</game><game id="38456">Cyberpunk 2077</game><game id="2448">Rise of the Dragon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1750316-919216_27062_front.jpg</image></root>
