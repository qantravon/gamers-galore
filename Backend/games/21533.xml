Cliffs of Dover will also feature DirectX 11 support and players can now slug it out over the skies of Europe in massive 128 player battles.Anti-Epilepsy Filter IssueJust before Cliffs of Dover's release, Ubisoft had 1C install a filter that would prevent people from having seizures while playing the game. But this had an adverse effect on the graphics, causing the game to have a very low frame rate, removing much of the visuals (Prop blurs, debris and muzzle flashes) as well as removing SLI support. There is no option to turn off the filter, and this caused an outrage within the sim community.In response to this, 1C released a patch several days after the release of Cliffs Of Dover enabling players to switch the filter on and off.AircraftRoyal Air ForceSupermarine Spitfire (Mk.
