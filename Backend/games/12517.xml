<root><id>12517</id><name>China: The Forbidden City</name><description>Set in 1775 historical China, in the Forbidden City in Beijing, the player is tasked by the Chinese emperor himself to solve a mysterious murder. Along the way the player will explore, adventure, talk and puzzle his way through Chinese bureaucracy and politics. Armed with a map, inventory and a first-person perspective. Basically, this game is like Cryo Interactive's other adventure educational games. Developed in collaboration with Canal + and French museum institution Réunion des Musées Nationaux. A lot of detail went into recreating the historic setting. Where Versailles got a lot of attention in its paintings and historic characters. Egypt got a lot of love in its depiction of ancient culture and architecture. This game shows the player a lot of the way the Chinese royal court worked. Not only through conversations. But also a bunch of puzzles involving forms and stamps and getting permission to do your investigating.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2640">Versailles 1685</game><game id="10419">Egypt 1156 B.C.: Tomb of the Pharaoh</game><game id="20362">Atlantis: The Lost Tales</game><game id="4118">Beyond Atlantis</game><game id="3341">Egypt II: The Heliopolis Prophecy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/128514/1769719-china_cover02.jpg</image></root>
