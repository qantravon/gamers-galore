The "Special" part refers to the fact that the player can occasionally find items that will allow them to do things they cannot normally, such as pull a block toward them. These are new additions and did not appear in the original game.The game is notable for being the first Famicom Disk System game to be developed and published by a company other than Nintendo. After this release, the FDS would see many more games from third-party publishers.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17545">Sokoban</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364887-fds_namidanosoukobanspecial_jp.jpg</image></root>
