Often referenced as one of the first games to integrate a cover system into its gameplay effectively, the game's use of blind fire while behind cover is also notable. Although these features have been praised by reviewers and mentioned as the inspiration for later games benefiting from similar mechanics, kill.switch was otherwise thought to be unremarkable.In a licensing deal with Destination Software, Inc., the game's development switched hands for a 2004 Game Boy Advance adaption, which received a similar mixture of praise and indifference from critics.GameplayMechanicskill.switch is a run 'n gun third-person shooter, with notably influential gameplay. During a Game Developer's Conference speech addressing the influences for Gears of War, Cliff Bleszinski cited kill.switch specifically as the inspiration for Epic's third-person shooter, which expanded upon the promise of ducking down and taking cover behind walls by allowing the cover to feel more interactive. It's often overlooked that kill.switch also allowed players to suppress enemies with blind fire or even aim while stuck to a wall, mechanics that are not only borrowed by the Gears of War franchise, but by many other recent top-selling releases.Although kill.switch may have borrowed the cover system from earlier, on-rails games such as Time Crisis, its execution of the concept in a free-control third-person manner was the best use of this mechanic seen at the time, building upon similar ideas found in WinBack: Covert Operations and then later in The Getaway.OperationsPrologueTrainingMiddle EastOpening MoveSlight Change Of PlanWhat's In The BoxSomething You Should Know [Xbox Only]Caspian SeaThink Like A GunThey Can Bill MeMinimum Safe DistanceNorth KoreaDon't Hate The PlayerAlarmedSubmissionLaunch PartyTemple RuinsFurious AngelThe Rabbit HoleClever GirlAll The Things She SaidArcher BaseFalse FrontThe Real ThingCheckmateVersusWeaponsM4: The M4 is a compact assault rifle which provides reliable firepower.M203 Grenade Launcher: Provides devastating effects when firing upon an area.AK-47 - You know what this is.AKU: Compact, but powerful, the AKU's a decent automatic weapon in a pinch.AKUG: Slight variant on the AKU.
