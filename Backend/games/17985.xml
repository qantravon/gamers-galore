The game was developed by Paragraph and published by Bullet Proof Software. At the bottom of the screen are six male heads. Pairs of hats fall from the top of the screen, and the player has to stack the hats on top of the men's heads. Once five of the same type of hat are stacked on top of each other, that stack is cleared and the player is awarded points. Super deformed versions of Pajhitnov and Pokhilko appear in the game as characters who assist the player in removing hats and rearranging stacks of hats. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="19197">Yoshi</game><game id="10628">Kirby's Star Stacker</game><game id="17641">Dr. Mario</game><game id="24052">Trash Panic</game><game id="23234">Tetris Party</game><game id="9151">Edtris 2600</game><game id="4757">Egaint</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2371415-hatris_fr_ntsc.png</image></root>
