Exciting Boxing was developed solely for the Famicom and included a special inflatable controller. The idea was that hitting the inflatable boxer triggered sensors inside the controller that would tell the game where the player hit and with how much power.The goal of the game is to make it past seven boxers, each the champion of their respective weight category from Flyweight to Heavyweight and, like Punch-Out!!, the seven come from all over the world.</description><genres><genre id="20">Boxing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23965">Punch-Out!!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2329004-exciting_boxing_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
