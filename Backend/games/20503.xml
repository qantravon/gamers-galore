The game ships with the Wii Balance Board, a floor-scale-shaped wireless peripheral containing multiple pressure sensors which the board uses to measure the player's weight, body mass index, and center of balance. Gameplay consists of roughly 40 activities the player can use, including various yoga poses, muscle workouts, aerobic exercises, and balance games. Wii Fit keeps track of user's statistics in two ways; through a "Wii Fitness Age" monitor, which runs a daily body test based on the user's age, weight and athletic ability, and through an activity log, which gives the player the option of keeping tracking of other physical activities not related to Wii Fit, like using the piano, stretching, and playing sports. While Wii Fit is the principle software intended for the Balance Board, a number of other Wii games have since integrated some form of support for it.ActivitiesYogaDeep BreathingHalf-MoonWarriorTreeSun SolutionStanding KneePalm TreeChairTriangleDownward-Facing DogDanceCobraBridgeSpinal TwistShoulder StandStrength TrainingSingle Leg ExtensionPush-up and Side PlankTorso Waist TwistsJackknifeLungeRowing SquatSingle Leg twistSideways Leg LiftParallel StretchTriceps ExtensionArm and Leg LiftSingle Arm StandPush-up ChallengeJackknife ChallengeStretch ChallengeAerobicsJoggingStep aerobicsHula Hoop and Super Hula HoopRhythm boxingBalance gamesSki JumpingSki and snowboard slalomsHeading Scocer ballsTable TiltTightrope WalkBalance BubblePenguin SlideLotus Focus</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="44">Fitness</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="20643">My Weight Loss Coach</game><game id="21099">Wii Music</game><game id="9439">Wii Play</game><game id="22415">Yourself Fitness</game><game id="22481">EyeToy: Kinetic Combat</game><game id="21041">Quick Yoga Training</game><game id="23979">Personal Trainer: Walking</game><game id="24302">Gold's Gym: Cardio Workout</game><game id="24481">EA Sports Active</game><game id="24140">Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009</game><game id="24645">My Fitness Coach</game><game id="26537">Daisy Fuentes Pilates</game><game id="26768">Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2010</game><game id="26788">My Fitness</game><game id="26859">Yoga for Wii - Entertainment for Body &amp; Soul</game><game id="27296">Walk It Out</game><game id="28433">The Biggest Loser</game><game id="29029">My Body Coach</game><game id="29030">Cyberbike</game><game id="30346">EA Sports Active 2.0</game><game id="31711">Your Shape Fitness Evolved</game><game id="31743">Zumba Fitness</game><game id="32357">EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp</game><game id="33185">NewU Fitness First Mind Body, Yoga &amp; Pilates Workout</game><game id="36440">Billy's Bootcamp</game><game id="39303">Family Trainer Series 4: Jogging Race</game><game id="40010">Family Trainer: Fuuun!
