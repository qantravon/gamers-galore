Its original release for the SNES in Japan (in 1992) came with improved graphics and eventually a fan translation. and later for the Game Boy Color which was localized in English for its North American release in 2000.Both of these classic Japanese RPG's played an important role back in the Famicom days in laying the foundation of the genre. Many of the genre staples like a turn-based battle system and experience points are part and parcel of both these games. Dragon Warrior I tells a very simple tale of a warrior called The Hero who must save the world from the wrath of the evil Dragon Lord. Dragon Warrior II (released in 1987 in Japan) built upon its predecessor's strength by increasing the number of playable characters from one to four and adding a more intricate plot.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4793">Final Fantasy V</game><game id="6336">Final Fantasy VI</game><game id="5739">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</game><game id="8403">Final Fantasy</game><game id="18601">The Final Fantasy Legend</game><game id="5827">Final Fantasy Legend II</game><game id="19592">Final Fantasy Legend III</game><game id="3966">Pokémon Red/Blue</game><game id="8210">Pokémon Gold/Silver</game><game id="9249">Chrono Trigger</game><game id="2516">Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom</game><game id="3638">Final Fantasy Mystic Quest</game><game id="267">Golden Sun</game><game id="17473">Lufia: The Legend Returns</game><game id="3928">Tengai Makyou II: Manjimaru</game><game id="23450">Tengai Makyou: Ziria</game><game id="13974">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue/Red Rescue Team</game><game id="6141">Mega Man Anniversary Collection</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1875227-box_dw1a2.png</image></root>
