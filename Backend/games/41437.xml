The sub-title, The Real-Time Adventure, is a reference to the game's introduction of a real-time, persistent, open world, where time continues to elapse, day-night cycles adjust the brightness of the screen to indicate the time of day, and certain stores and non-player characters would only be available at certain times of the day. The game also gives players direct control over the player character. The game also features a fantasy story, full-colour 2D overhead scrollinggraphics, and RPG elements. It won the 1987 Game of the Year award from Japanese gaming magazine Oh!X.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/139866/2424197-14517.png</image></root>
