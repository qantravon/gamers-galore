Happy souls are worth more when "harvest" day arrives.PlotYou are the best Dungeon Lord there is, yet something has gone wrong. Your ex-girlfriend hatched a diabolical plan, leaving you on the bottom of the hierarchy, yet at the top of the dungeons. This is clearly bad, since we all know the deepest dungeons are the best.
