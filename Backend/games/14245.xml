Throughout the game enemy crabs attempt to attack you, and should they touch you, you will lose a life. More lives can be obtained by collecting the golden coins which appear in each level at the same time the secret door does. You do not have the ability to jump in the game, but instead the world must be explored by using a series of ladders in each level. The defining mechanic of the game is that you have the ability to transform objects and enemies in the world into whatever object your wand is currently set too.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1446">Lemmings</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/176/1291463-fgodmom3.gif</image></root>
