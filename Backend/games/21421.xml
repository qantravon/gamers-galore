At release the game proved to be a moderate success both financially and critically. A sequel, Star Trek: Judgment Rites, was released a few years later. The game was developed and published by Interplay.PlotRemoved from known Star Trek canon, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary used the then new chapter format of game play, deviating from the widely used single story arc. In doing so it made the game more manageable to play.  By utilizing several characters throughout each mission/story you were awarded a score based on your performance on that mission.  In all there were 7 missions/stories in the game. They were:Demon World.Hijacked.Love's Labor Jeopardized.Another Fine Mess....Feathered Serpent.That Old Devil Moon.Vengeance.Alternate VersionAs was customary in the Early days of the CD-ROM drive craze, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary  would later be re-released in a CD-ROM version that also included the voices of the original cast to add another level of authenticity to the title.Additional NotesEven though the game was designed to run in the early days of MS-DOS, the title is still very playable through the use of DOSBOX emulation.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7486">Star Trek: Judgment Rites</game><game id="17852">The Oregon Trail</game><game id="16298">The 7th Guest</game><game id="3871">Oregon Trail II</game><game id="4372">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</game><game id="16666">Dune</game><game id="3633">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</game><game id="3019">The Secret of Monkey Island</game><game id="11852">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3619/192497-startrek25thbox.jpg</image></root>
