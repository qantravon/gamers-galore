The game is notable for the odd design choice of having the camera follow who's in the lead regardless of weather or not that's an actual human player. If a cpu biker gets to far ahead he will freeze while the other player catches up to prevent the screen from scrolling away from the player.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6787">Supercross Circuit</game><game id="21451">Trials 2 Second Edition</game><game id="15429">Excitebike 64</game><game id="24891">Moto Chaser</game><game id="33391">Suzuki's RM 250 Motocross</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1410111-intellivision_motocross.jpg</image></root>
