The game involved illegal street racing in a variety of licensed cars, including those from Subaru and Nissan. Throughout the game, players were challenged to win the affection of different ladies by completing challenges to impress them. Upon doing so they would unlock some video content of these women. One feature the game possessed that its closest rivals did not, was a damage system. This system could effectively bankrupt a player if they were not cautious, as damage repair costs were extremely expensive. Need for Speed: Underground had a similar, urban feel to its game style, but SRS possessed an open-world system - something that was only implemented with Need for Speed: Underground 2's release. This may have been a response to SRS boasting this feature beforehand.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9651">Need for Speed Underground 2</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="21307">Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="23347">Test Drive</game><game id="10370">Street Legal</game><game id="7152">Street Legal Racing: Redline</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1799379-box_srs.png</image></root>
