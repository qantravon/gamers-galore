<root><id>265</id><name>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Hard Evidence</name><description>OverviewAs in all the previous CSI games, the player has five cases to lay his hands on and investigate. The goal of each case, of course, is to find the culprit and discover the truth as led by the evidence. To solve the case, the player has a handful of crime scene investigation tools (i.e. rubber gloves to collect basic, big pieces of evidence, tweezers for bullets found in walls from gun fights and fingerprint powder for, if you haven't already figured it out, collecting fingerprints.) at his disposal. If the player gets somehow stuck in a case, there's always going to be the partner to come and ask for some advice. Each case the player gets a new partner, eventually getting to see and ''work'' with every main character from CSI: Vegas. At the end of each case, the player gets an evaluation score based on how well he's collected and followed evidence and if the player has asked any advice to his partner.The voice acting is done by the show's original cast with exceptions of Catherine's and Sara's characters who are voiced by Edie Mirman and Kate Savage respectively.CSI CrewFor each case you undertake you'll be backed up by another CSI member who will help you asses the crime scenes, interview witness, and offer their insights into the evidence. These CSI staff members are:Gil GrissomGil Grissom, the head of the LVPD CSI graveyard shift. He'll pop in from time to time in order to check up on your progress on the current case.
