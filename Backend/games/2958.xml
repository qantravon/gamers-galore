The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20234">Top Shop</game><game id="4187">Romance of the Three Kingdoms II</game><game id="9459">Culdcept</game><game id="24070">Culdcept DS</game><game id="1655">Shanghai</game><game id="26837">Scrabble Interactive: 2009 Edition</game><game id="2340">The Game of Life</game><game id="24299">Dokapon Journey</game><game id="12812">Star Wars: Monopoly</game><game id="39818">Tetsudou-Oh</game><game id="829">Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise</game><game id="41133">Bounders and Cads</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362073-nes_monopoly.jpg</image></root>
