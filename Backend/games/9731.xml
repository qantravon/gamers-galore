More missions, more crafts, more enemies. And yes, the graphics resemble Virus, but the gameplay is completely different as you have to take a more strategic approach. The controls are not easy to master but the game rewards the time you spent learning it.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/687824-1130592402_00.png</image></root>
