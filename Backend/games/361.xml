Your objective is to connect three colors together and detonate them. Chains however can be longer than three colors, and there are various power-ups that you can chain together to make multicolored combos. There is a meter on the screen, and if it runs out, (by missing too many colors) it's game over. Unlike most puzzlers, Fantavision is actually a level based game. There is no endless mode at all to speak of. At the end of each level, players can save their firework display and replay it from a variety of different camera angles and through various filters. Also just to be weird there are 1960's styled retro-future, live action vignettes that appeear between levels,</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1826">Boom Boom Rocket</game><game id="24378">Big Bang Mini</game><game id="18373">We Love Katamari</game><game id="40352">Fireworks</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png</image></root>
