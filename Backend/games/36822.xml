C.P.U Bach can more easily understood as a software program that allows the user to assist the program in creating music. The user does not create music directly. Instead, the user selects from a set of variables, including type of music and instruments. The software produces a musical concert from the variables selected. The music created is unique to the variables selected, and is not pre-recorded. The game was intended to show the power of computers to create music with a limited amount of user input. Imitating the style of the famous composer Johann Sebastian Bach was thought to make it especially impressive.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21099">Wii Music</game><game id="492">Electroplankton</game><game id="21427">Korg DS-10</game><game id="27155">Korg DS-10 Plus</game><game id="23869">LSDJ</game><game id="647">MTV: Music Generator</game><game id="32895">MTV: Music Generator 2</game><game id="33487">MTV Music Generator 3: This is the Remix</game><game id="29493">Music 3000</game><game id="34616">Music Composer</game><game id="8305">SimTunes</game><game id="32683">PixelJunk 4am</game><game id="25032">EZ Muze: Hamst3r Edition</game><game id="31559">Drum Studio</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/143145/2065194-c.p.u_bach_box_back.jpg</image></root>
