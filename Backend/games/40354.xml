<root><id>40354</id><name>Super Racing</name><description>OverviewSuper Racing is a top-down racing game that allows the player to compete in a series of Formula 1 races, first by doing a time trial "practice" on each course to determine their starting position for the actual race, which includes CPU opponents. Upon starting the game the player can choose from a "Real Mode" and a "BGM Mode" - all that is that different is that the latter option provides background music.The game takes a few measures for the sake of realism, including coming into the pit stop area if the car is getting too damaged and letting players select from a model that emphasizes speed or one that emphasizes turning. Real names from the F1 racing circuit are used, for both the car manufacturers/sponsors and the 1988-appropriate professional racers, albeit with a few minor name changes to avoid copyright issues.It is one of the few Sega Master System games to never see an international release.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23929">Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race</game><game id="2140">Micro Machines</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2358717-superracing_sms_jp_front_medium.jpg</image></root>
