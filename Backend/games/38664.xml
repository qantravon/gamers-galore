The mission structure is very similar to Monster Hunter, as there is a hub where players get missions that they must complete within a time limit and then are sent into the world to find their target.  Mercenary Kings was announced with a Kickstarter goal of $75k, and reached $116k of that goal. It did not reach any of its stretch goals. An unfinished version of the game with 60 missions was released via Steam Early Access on July 22, 2013.A Playstation 4 version of the game was announced during the Sony E3 2013 Press Conference, though there is no release date for it yet.
