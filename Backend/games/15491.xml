No longer property of Technos Japan Corporation, Double Dragon V is very different from previous games in the franchise. Double Dragon V was released on August 5, 1994 in North America (for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis) and April 5, 1995 for the Atari Jaguar (by Telegames). Developed by Leland Interactive Media and published by Tradewest, Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a 2D fighting game based on the Double Dragon cartoon series, rather than being a side-scrolling beat-em-up like its predecessors.The game's plot loosely follows the Double Dragon cartoon series that was also produced by Tradewest. In the game, the Shadow Master creates a virus known as the Shadow Plague. In order to prevent the Shadow Master from unleashing the virus into Metro City, Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee must fight a variety of characters in one-on-one tournament battles.GameplayBilly Lee vs. SickleCapitalizing on the incredible popularity of the tournament fighting genre in the 1990s (originating from Street Fighter II), Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is similar to many other fighting games from that time period. Players can use weak, medium, or strong punches and kicks to dispatch their opponents, utilizing a six-button layout similar to Street Fighter II. The Genesis version allows for a three-button layout, where allowing players to press the start button to switch between kicking and punching.Special moves are activated by holding down one direction, and then quickly shifting directions and hitting a certain button (e.g. holding left for two seconds, quickly pressing down and punch simultaneously will unleash a special attack from Jimmy Lee). This combination of button inputs was criticized by fans and critics who found it strange to have to quickly switch directions without sliding the control pad.The Quest Mode takes players through a story.There are several modes available in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls. Tournament Mode is the default single player fighting mode, in which the player can fight through every character in the game in a random order. The multiplayer mode, VS. Mode, is a traditional two-player arena fighting mode, allowing players to choose whichever character they want. There is a second single player mode, Quest Mode, which adds a story, but is essentially the same as Tournament Mode. Quest Mode has two stories available; the Lee brothers fighting the Shadow Master, or one of the Shadow Warriors fighting to become his apprentice. Additionally, there is a mode that allows players to choose two computer controlled characters, and watch them fight each other.Another feature of Double Dragon V are Overkills, which are finishing moves that give a different losing animation for the defeated character. Each character has a special animation, triggered when they are killed with a specific attack. For example, the Lee brothers' Overkill is a flash of light, leaving the Lee brothers as a skeleton, with only their sword remaining.CharactersBilly LeeBilly LeeBorn on October 23, 1969, Billy Lee likes milk and doesn't like the Shadow Master.
