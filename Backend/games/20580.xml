<root><id>20580</id><name>Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution</name><description>OverviewSid Meier's Civilization Revolution is a turn-based 4X strategy game developed by Firaxis and published by 2K for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo DS on July 8, 2008. A spinoff of Sid Meier's PC-oriented Civilization franchise, the game is simplified for both seventh-generation video game consoles and handheld devices.Similar to the other games in the franchise, Civilization Revolution features a fast-paced alternate history in which players (as one of sixteen historical figures) develop a civilization alongside other civilizations, and attempt to win in one of many ways (such as capturing the capital cities of opponent civilizations or being the first to build and launch a space ship towards Alpha Centauri).A modification to the Nintendo DS version was released for all iOS devices on August 6, 2009 and all Windows Phone devices on March 26, 2012.GameplayAdvisors pop up throughout the game with useful info and advice.In translating the Civilization experience to consoles Firaxis has a goal of integrating the rapid turn-based style of the original games with a more streamlined console-friendly control scheme. Like other Civilization games, players choose a historical figure such as Lincoln, Cleopatra, Stalin, Bonaparte and Catherine the Great to lead their civilization. With a scaled progression of time, your small village becomes a bustling metropolis as it moves through the ages. You may, with the advice of animated advisers that pop up throughout the game, decide to keep peace with other societies. On the other hand, you may decide to squash those poor, uncivilized tribes with an example of advanced firepower. The choice is up to you, though interactions with other leaders will be shaped with that character's historically-noted personality.As with all Civilization games, power is not the only route to victory. You are allowed to play in a number of different styles, each of which can lead to winning a match.Domination: You must capture and hold each of the other 4 civilizations' capital cities.Technology: Be the first to launch a space ship and discovery the planet Alpha Centauri.Cultural: Acquire 20 Great Persons, wonders, and/or captured cities and build the United Nations wonder.Economic: Amass 20,000 gold and build the World Bank wonder.Other single player modes include Game of the Week and Scenario. Game of the Week is a weekly match in which players compete asynchronously over the Internet. The map, starting location and competing civilizations are the same for everyone. The best scores are posted online, broken down by difficulty, to show you how you stack up against players around the world. To prevent cheating, the save option is disabled in this mode.Scenarios are unique matches that add their own win conditions and rules.MultiplayerIn addition to the single-player mode, the game also has online support on consoles. This allows up to four human players and one AI player to compete in multiple modes of ranked or unranked matches.Head-to-Head: Two human players face off against each other and 3 AI controlled civilizations.Teams: Two teams of two humans and one AI civilization fight for supremacy.Free-for-all: Four human players and one AI in an all out brawl to become the best civilization.CivilizationsThere are sixteen civilizations in the game, each has unique attributes that they gain at the beginning of each era.
