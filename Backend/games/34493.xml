It features a stark comic book-esque look, with a black, white and red aesthetic similar to MadWorld. The game has 120 vehicles spread across 6 different classes: Muscle, Sedan, Wagon, Coupe, Truck and Monster Truck which players can use to race in 20 levels located in 5 different arenas.Mayhem is somewhat unique in it's use of anaglyph 3D which can be viewed with any standard anaglyph (red/blue) glasses. However, the game does not require the use of the 3D graphics and can be played without any eyeweare by adjusting the options. For comparison this is the same type of 3D found in Rad Racer and Minecraft.Game ModesMayhem features 4 different game modes:Demolition Derby - Every man for himself in a destruction contest to be the last one standing.Banger Racing - Race and battle your way around the track to come in first place.Domination - Battle other cars to try to knock them into the pit.Eliminator - Players must race around the track and stay in the front, as players in last place are eliminated from the race after each lap.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37034">Dirt Showdown</game><game id="10084">Mario Kart 64</game><game id="9509">Ivan "Iron Man" Stewart's Super Off Road</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1828908-box_mayhem.png</image></root>
