The game was developed by Hudson for the Gameboy Advance and was published by Bandai in Japan on October 24, 2003. Similar to the rest of the Tengai Makyou series, Oriental Blue was never released outside Japan but in 2013 an unofficial translation patch was created by Romhacking Aerie. This release marked the first time an RPG in the Tengai series was playable in English.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24011">Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart</game><game id="23975">Magical Vacation</game><game id="44185">Langrisser Millennium WS: The Last Century</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/834407-918788_26687_front.jpg</image></root>
