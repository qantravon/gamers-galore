<root><id>17782</id><name>Xenon 2: Megablast</name><description>Developed by The Bitmap Brothers for the Amiga and Atari ST as a sequel to the original Xenon (also developed by them), Xenon 2 is widely regarded as a class of the 'SHMUP' genre. It is also one of the Bitmap Brothers' most renowned games, responsible for a large part of their cult following in retro gaming, and long-standing good reputation.Part of the game's legacy stems from its difficulty, considered extremely steep even by genre standards.It was later ported to many platforms including the PC (which added a post completion bonus mode) and the Sega Genesis.The Bomb the Bass song "Megablast" was used on the sound track to this game. Its presence explains the game's subtitle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="289">Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</game><game id="5146">Xenon</game><game id="948">The Chaos Engine</game><game id="12019">Magic Pockets</game><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="16085">Dominator</game><game id="2763">Frenetic</game><game id="998">Gemini Wing</game><game id="14837">The Reap</game><game id="499">Tyrian</game><game id="6784">Tyrian 2000</game><game id="16253">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389671-genesis_xenon2megablast_pal.jpg</image></root>
