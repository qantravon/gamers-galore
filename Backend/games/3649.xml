Furthermore, Bulboids only emit white light, thus providing a need for the use of prisms to split the light into separate colors for each specifically colored Globos. Gluons  Accompanying the Bulboids and Globos are the Gluons, a set of items that can be used to redirect or break light into set colors.Later levels become gradually more complex.  Mirrors: These can be used to reflect the light in a 90 degree angle across the stage. Both sides are usable. Filter Blocks: Filter the color into the color of the block itself. Prisms: Prisms split pure light into different colors to be fed to hungry Globos. T-Splitters: Split the light into two directions. They cannot be rotated. Cycloids: Cycloids filter light in the same way as Filter Blocks, but will rotate through an assortment of differing colors.Globos and Bulboids in action.
