Reletively unique for a console game at the time the gameplay was mostly in 3D with your character able to move around planets in any direction he or she saw fit. As mentioned earlier the main gimmick to the game was that you could transform into other vehicles, this was fairly cool but also fairly cumbersome as rather than having one buttoon to transform. Each transformation required a different button combination, which the player was pretty much forced to memorize.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3984">Star Fox</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364695-snes_vortex.jpg</image></root>
