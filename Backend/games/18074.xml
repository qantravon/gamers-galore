<root><id>18074</id><name>Cyberia</name><description>A shortened version of the game, consisting solely of the first half of the story, was released along with graphics cards under the title  Cyberia: Mission Norway. A sequel,  Cyberia 2  : Resurrection, was released in 1995 for PC only  GameplayCyberia relied heavily on two major styles, puzzle solving and on rails shooting. The majority was based around the puzzle solving, with the player taking control of a hacker named Zak as he wandered the halls of various complexes, usually watching employee's video emails. However, Zak would sometimes find himself in control of a few vehicles, which is where the on rails shooting came in. At the beginning of each game the player could specify the difficulty of both independently, although both couldn't be set to easy as the game considered it "too easy".
