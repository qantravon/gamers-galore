The game is a 2D sidescroller where the player takes Bloodrayne from left to right through 15 levels of brutal killing (despite the excessive blood however, the game is rated T for Teen).Let me have a bite.Bloodrayne has a variety of moves such as a bite attack where she can suck on an enemy's health to restore her own or infect them, turning them into a walking grenade. She also has a dash move to get behind enemies and dodge attacks.This is WayForward's first foray into Xbox 360 and PS3 development, as BloodRayne: Betrayal is set to appear on XBLA and PSN in Summer 2011.SoundtrackThe original soundtrack for BloodRayne: Betrayal was composed by Jake Kaufman and was released on September 8, 2011 via Bandcamp. Kaufman admittedly cites Castlevania: Symphony of the Night as an influence for the score.Tracklist:TitleDusk FallsThe CrabpuncherStage CompleteSanguine NightmareRavelVampires' BallCastle RisingThe Crimson DemonBetrayalKaganPeaceful MoonPoisoned HallsZetagamaEscapeCursed Dawn (End Credits)Bonus GalleryDusk Falls (NES)The Crabpuncher (NES)Sanguine Nightmare (NES)Vampires' Ball (NES)Castle Rising (NES)The Crimson Demon (NES)Betrayal (NES)Kagan (NES)Peaceful Moon (NES)Poisoned Halls (NES)Zetagama (NES)Escape (NES)Stage Complete (NES)</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25637">Shank</game><game id="12036">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</game><game id="31659">Moon Diver</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1839014-box_brayneb.png</image></root>
