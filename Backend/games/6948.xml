<root><id>6948</id><name>Dark Colony</name><description>Dark Colony is an RTS released in 1997  by SSI and GameTek for Windows and Mac OS.  It is set on Mars in the year 2137, where humans have discovered that grey aliens (called Taar) have nefarious plans for them, and must be stopped.     Dark Colony is a fairly standard "me-too" game in the vein of Starcraft.  Players must build bases, mine resources, and produce units to defeat other players.  There are two playable races, Humans and Taar.   Each race has nearly identical units, differently mainly in appearance.  Most notably, Dark Colony was one of the first RTS games to feature a day/night cycle, and each race gains advantages or disadvantages based on what time it is.  </description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13062">StarCraft</game><game id="1552">Dune 2000</game><game id="9719">Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</game><game id="17543">Destroy All Humans!</game><game id="19524">Final Liberation: Warhammer Epic 40,000</game><game id="9185">Destroy All Humans! 2</game><game id="4301">Area-51</game><game id="196">X-COM: UFO Defense</game><game id="4777">X-COM: Apocalypse</game><game id="10005">Dark Planet: Battle for Natrolis</game><game id="5205">Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand</game><game id="5921">M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration</game><game id="5817">WarGames: Defcon 1</game><game id="44250">Tridonis</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17172/787163-darkcolony.jpg</image></root>
