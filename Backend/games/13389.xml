The maps are viewed  from a     top-down perspective and feature the units, terrain, roads, water and buidlings as well as a    grid system to visualize the range of movement capabilities. In turns, the factions would move their units. The mission goals vary from map to map and can include the capture or protection of buildings or annihilatin of the enemy or enemy forces.
