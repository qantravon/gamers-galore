The player avatar, chosen from one of four vampires (both male and female), is one of the vampires sent to find the scrolls. The player must talk to NPCs, discovering clues and making friends, to find their way to the scroll. Vampires must feed on blood as well, of course. The ending is determined by how many characters have been befriended, and how many have been eaten.Gothos utilizes  FMV technology.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="507">Riana Rouge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1797070-gothos.jpg</image></root>
