Scores vary from 100 points to 500 points. As expected, harder to land pockets are rewarded with higher score totals. Unlike modern pinball machines, these games from the 30's and 40's had no flippers. Players would pull back the spring and hope for the best score possible. These machines where more about luck then skill. Where could find this thing back in the day?Most likely this particular machine was found in drug stores, bars, nickelodeons and any other retail environment where you would see drop claw machines and other such devises today.  DetailsAccording to the Internet Pinball Machine Database states that 10 balls cost a nickel. It could be altered to only allow the player 5 balls for the same price.The cabinet measures 31 1/2 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 6 3/8 inches high. </description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/389/533007-01___wow_.jpg</image></root>
