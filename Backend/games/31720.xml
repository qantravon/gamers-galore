Unlike Wii Sports or Kinect Sports, MotionSports has a more realistic graphical look and does not feature player avatars like many other Kinect titles do.  Playable sports include football, soccer, skiing, boxing, horseback riding, and hang gliding. MotionSports also adds new interactive elements to each sport. For example, during the skiing game, you can throw snow balls at your opponents to slow them down.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31703">Kinect Sports</game><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="31802">Deca Sports Freedom</game><game id="36666">Big League Sports</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2250697-box_msports.png</image></root>
