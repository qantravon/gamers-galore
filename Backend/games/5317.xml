You gain points for eating all of the patches of grass on the screen while the screen scrolls in random directions. The screen scrolls in all four directions (up, down, left, right). The walls of the level are always in a different pattern for each level, and if you touch the walls you lose a life.Â  As a result, careful planning is required to ensure that you don't get trapped into a corner. There are in total seven levels that increase in difficulty as you go through.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1370420-splat3.jpg</image></root>
