<root><id>98</id><name>John Elway's Quarterback</name><description>OverviewOriginally an arcade unit, John Elway's Quarterback allowed up to four players (two per side) to play at once. You could play either as the quarterback or the halfback in addition to defense. The game continued on a pay as you play basis at a rate of twenty five cents per quarter of action. Despite carrying the name of NFL star John Elway, the game was not sanctioned by the National Football League so it contained only generic teams from various cities.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21713">NFL Fever 2003</game><game id="20848">NCAA Football 09</game><game id="6811">NCAA Football 2005</game><game id="21706">NCAA Football 07</game><game id="2632">Mutant League Football</game><game id="20784">Football Manager 2008</game><game id="7532">NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl</game><game id="3259">NCAA Football 99</game><game id="16279">NCAA Football 2004</game><game id="9305">NCAA Football 2003</game><game id="16392">NCAA Football 2002</game><game id="20711">Madden NFL 09</game><game id="21413">Madden NFL 08</game><game id="16585">Madden NFL 07</game><game id="6648">Madden NFL 06</game><game id="4222">Madden NFL 2005</game><game id="11911">Madden NFL 2004</game><game id="15987">Madden NFL 2003</game><game id="10845">Madden NFL 2002</game><game id="8822">Madden NFL 2001</game><game id="12373">Madden NFL 2000</game><game id="13996">Madden NFL 99</game><game id="8679">Madden NFL 98</game><game id="12957">Madden NFL 96</game><game id="6279">Madden NFL 97</game><game id="7715">Madden NFL '95</game><game id="7106">Madden NFL '94</game><game id="9640">NFL GameDay 2000</game><game id="3333">NFL GameDay â€˜98</game><game id="7848">NFL GameDay '99</game><game id="14735">NFL GameDay '97</game><game id="2356">NFL GameDay 2001</game><game id="14892">NFL GameDay 2002</game><game id="18016">NFL GameDay 2004</game><game id="13056">ESPN NFL 2K5</game><game id="6937">ESPN NFL Football</game><game id="10530">NFL 2K3</game><game id="14001">NFL 2K2</game><game id="805">NFL 2K1</game><game id="4659">NFL 2K</game><game id="8417">NFL Blitz</game><game id="2849">NFL Blitz 2000</game><game id="12669">NFL Blitz 2001</game><game id="20653">NFL Blitz '99</game><game id="21512">NFL Blitz: Pro</game><game id="9044">NFL Blitz 20-02</game><game id="4352">NFL Blitz 20-03</game><game id="4166">Blitz: The League</game><game id="20920">Blitz: The League II</game><game id="4829">NFL Fever 2002</game><game id="17081">NFL Fever 2004</game><game id="1700">Joe Montana Football</game><game id="8073">NFL Sports Talk Football '93 Starring Joe Montana</game><game id="164">NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana</game><game id="2708">ABC Monday Night Football</game><game id="455">Super Play Action Football</game><game id="5629">Backyard Football 2002</game><game id="27106">Joe Montana's NFL Football</game><game id="14074">Walter Payton Football</game><game id="44147">Football Fury</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361911-nes_johnelwaysquarterback.jpg</image></root>
