<root><id>40530</id><name>Goal!</name><description>OverviewGoal! is a soccer sim developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco for the NES and was released in all regions. It is not to be confused with Dino Dini's Goal!, a soccer game created by Virgin Games and an unofficial sequel to Kick Off, nor is it to be confused with its SNES sequel Super Goal!, which was released in the US as simply Goal!.Unlike many soccer games at the time, the game uses an isometric perspective of the field rather than a straight horizontal or vertical view of the pitch. This would become a more common viewpoint in later soccer games, including EA's FIFA series among others.The game is based on the World Cup international soccer tournament and allows players to choose from national sides only. These sides include:Group A: Argentina, Holland, Denmark, USA.Group B: England, Italy, Japan, France.Group C: Brazil, Spain, Algeria, USSR.Group D: West Germany, Poland, Belgium, Uruguay.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12955">Soccer</game><game id="12888">FIFA Soccer 95</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361761-nes_goal.jpg</image></root>
