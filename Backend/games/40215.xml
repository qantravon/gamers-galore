Players take control of all 4 players, each of whom has different weapons and ranges from where they can kill enemies. Players must strategically place them around the map to handle the oncoming waves of enemies, while the missions themselves have pieces of them randomly generated. Each character has unique team buffs, special attacks, and individual upgrade trees. Defeated enemies leave behind cash, which can be used to buy new weapons at vending machines.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2350737-borderlands_legends.jpeg</image></root>
