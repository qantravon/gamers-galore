Boppin’ was developed by  Accursed Toys and was published by  Apogee Software (of  Duke Nukem and  Commander Keen fame). GameplayBoppin’ involves both platforming and  block matching. Players control two characters named Yeet and Boik who must make their way through levels and throw blocks at diagonal 45 degree angles. The objective of each level is to throw blocks at other blocks of the same type, eventually making certain shapes and freeing creatures trapped within. The fact that blocks can only be thrown at a specific diagonal angle complicates the game, and requires the player to creatively use walls, refractors and elevators to bounce blocks into their appropriate place.The game featured a  shareware episode titled “Bothersome Hunnybunz,” in addition to three paid episodes. The Amiga version of the game featured 150 levels, while the MS-DOS version featured 160. Both versions included a  level editor.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7001/315696-bopsw_064.png</image></root>
