Between quests, players can explore the town, healing themselves and buying and selling items at the store. Combat is for the most part button mashing. Each class has a different type of main attack, but those can change with the different items you find throughout the game. Each class also has its own set of spells that unlock as you level up, which deplete your mana. As you deal damage to the enemies, your Alter Ego meter fills up, which allows you to transform into a larger beast momentarily. Potions, which you can find or buy like other items, can refill not only your health meter,  but your mana and Alter Ego meters as well. The game costs 800 Microsoft Points on the Xbox Live Marketplace.   Overview Arkadian warriors is an action RPG that was developed by Wanako Studios for the Xbox 360 Arcade.
