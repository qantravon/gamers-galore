Once you steal it, he will want to "play with it" a bit around and return it to his designated place. After you complete all missions for him, the Buzzard becomes available for use anytime from the Algonquin docks. It will be always dyed in gold paint.Skylift - you can see this big helicopter in the mission "For the Man Who Has Everything". You can't fly it neither in single nor in multiplayer.Swift - The Swift is available during a night club mission and also the mission where you take the Celebinator on a tour of the city. It's parked at the west side of Algonquin where a Buzzard is normally parked until the Buzzard appears later.Akuma - a fast bike, that trades security for maneuverability and aerodynamics. Good for stunts.Faggio - the classic Faggio scooter bike from Vice City and San Andreas. It's handling is probably it's only redeeming feature.Vader - a rare street bike that spawns randomly in Liberty City.Blade - a fast boat that can be usually found at the West Algonquin docks.Floater - another fast boat, widely used in the triathlon challenges.Smuggler - another fast boat, widely used in the triathlon challenges.Buffalo - Call Henrique and ask him to drive the vehicle to you.

This can only be done after completing a certain percentage of the game.F620 - Call Henrique and ask him to drive the vehicle to you. This can only be done after completing a certain percentage of the game.Schafter - The Schafter is parked out front of the Maisonette 9 club when doing some night club management missions that require you to leave the club.Serrano - This is a modded version of the Serrano.

A pipe bomb behaves exactly like a grenade, as it can be cooked to shorten its detonation time.PistolAutomatic Pistol - The CZ 75 is a pistol with low damage, but can fire as fast as a machine gun. However, this gun eats ammo like crazy so make sure you stock up if you intend to use it.ShotgunSawn-off Shotgun - This sawn-off shotgun is similar to the shotguns not included in TLAD, but with two big exceptions. One, it can only carry two rounds at a time so for those of you who loved to go trigger happy with the combat shotgun, this might not be for you. On the plus side this gun can be used while on a bike, allowing some quick kills if you are close enough.ShotgunAutomatic Shotgun - This Armsel Striker kind've looks like a traditional grenade launcher but instead fires shotgun shells. This gun, like the automatic pistol, takes a lot of ammo but can quickly take out enemies and is somewhat effective on vehicles. The gun also reloads quicker than a normal shotgun since it doesn't need to be pumped.Grenade LauncherGrenade Launcher - The HK69 grenade launcher is a very nice weapon that can fire grenades quickly and accurately. The grenades take about 5 seconds to detonate so take that into account, but they will blow up on contact to a vehicle or person. The grenade launcher is also single fire so prepare to reload with each shot.New weapons in the Ballad Of Gay TonyThrown WeaponsSticky BombsSatchel Charges can be used to tag vehicles or objects for remote detonation.PistolsPistol .44The √ÅMT Automag Model 180 is a highly accurate handgun.Submachine GunsAssault SMGThe P90 is a compact submachine gun, its lightweight design makes it ideal in urban environments. It is the only submachine gun that cannot be fired from a vehicle.Gold SMGFor the man that has everything.ShotgunsExplosive ShotgunThe AA-12 is an automatic shotgun capable of rapid fire action. The addition of explosive shells can turn this into a formidable weapon.Sniper RiflesAdvanced SniperThe DSR-1 is a long range sniper rifle with a high rate of fire and added zoom function.Machine GunsAdvanced MGThe M249 SAW is a light machine gun with a high rate of fire. It is capable of firing 900 rounds a minute.Miscellaneous EquipmentParachuteEscape a falling Helicopter with style!Or do you feel like Base jumping off of a building? Well now you can!
