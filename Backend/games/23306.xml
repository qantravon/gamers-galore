The game was later ported to the PS2 and released on April 24, 2008 with all adult content removed, but had additional scenarios created to for it to replace them. H2O was Makura's first game, and performed very well in sales. It came in at #2 of the national bishoujo game sales rankings in Japan, putting it just behind Summer Days. The sequel, called Root After and Another, was released on October 26, 2007.GameplayPlayer input is extremely limited in the game, even for a visual novel. There is only a single choice they must make, which determines whom of the three available girls the protagonist ends up with. H2O also differs from other visual novels in how it presents its dialogue. Where normally dialogue is presented in a text box at the bottom of the screen, in H2O the text box covers the entire screen. It can, however, be hidden so the player is able to fully enjoy the artwork.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23279">Happiness!</game><game id="23307">Root After and Another</game><game id="23374">Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru</game><game id="23482">D.C.
