Users simply followed the on-screen instructions to learn how to play the piano, tapping keys indicated by the screen. Eventually, the user would learn to recognize the various notes and learn the musical notation, and could progress to playing the music without the use of indicators.Due to the rarity of the bundle, specifically the keyboard peripheral itself and all its necessary cables, copies of the Miracle Piano Teaching System - whether it's the NES, SNES or Genesis version - command high prices among collectors. </description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22167">Synthesia</game><game id="27919">Rock Band 3</game><game id="34464">Rocksmith</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1501912-miraclep_front.jpg</image></root>
