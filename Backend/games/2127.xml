It is a quiz show hosted by Chef of South Park Fame. In between rounds of answering questions players compete in various minigames. The game is not trivia about South Park, the show as you might assume. It is trivia about topics that relate to South Park, such as the band The Cure. The opening screen has Chef preforming his hit song Simultaneous.The game was not very well received due to how thin the game is, as there is nothing outside of the trivia, and there is not much trivia.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20926">Buzz!
