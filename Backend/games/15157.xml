After the robbers blew your bank to smithereens, you must collect all the money with your trusty vacuum. As you are collecting the money your vacuum begins to fill, expanding until full. (Holding up to 32 "bills") Once full you must return the money to the vault. (Center, highlighted yellow by the Vectrex overlay) As time passes the robbers will continue to spawn (Maps start with 1 robber and go up to 4) and they will also get anxious and begin to get faster. At the 4 corners of the board there are "special rooms", that when entered your vacuum becomes supercharged. While supercharged, your vacuum will hold infinite money and also suck up the robbers themselves. Also while supercharged you cannot deposit money into the vault, any money collected during the charge can never be deposited into bank and does not add to the size of the vacuum. The supercharge lasts only 10 seconds. After all the money is retrieved, the board flashes and resets the game to the beginning while keeping track of score.     Scoring 1 Bill/Money collected = 10 points1 Bill/Money returned to vault = 20 pointsFull Vacuum load returned = 640 pointsSupercharging = 50 pointsRobber eaten = 100 points If robbers are eaten consecutively with same supercharge, scoring is doubled with each robber (i.e. 4 robbers eaten with same charge, 1st robber = 100 points, 2nd robber = 200 points, 3rd robber = 400 points, 4th robber = 800 points) </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11244/1755997-clean_sweep.jpg</image></root>
