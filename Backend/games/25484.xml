The premises is similar to that of Guitar Hero, except that in this case you don't actually play a guitar but simply tap to the beat of the song.The game uses a rewritten codebase and graphics engine, first seen in Tap Tap Dance, and subsequently used as the base for all Tap Tap releases and spinoffs to date.Playing The GameThe basics of TTR 2 are very simple, and anyone familiar with Guitar Hero will be able to pick this up quickly. The player begins by picking a song, and then as that plays, colored balls will come scrolling down the screen. It is then simply a matter of hitting them in time with the beat and getting as many points as possible. While that sounds extremely simple, the game features several more complex manuevers like double taps, holds and shakes. The second one is indicated by a glowing trail following behind the ball that's coming down, and the shakes are indicated by arrows which point out what direction you need to shake your phone in. As you score more hits, you start racking up multipliers and eventually you'll unlock the Revenge Mode (at 5x multiplier), which can be activated by shaking the iPhone. The goal is, of course, to get as many points as possible by hitting as many of the colored balls in time as you can.The game also features several multiplayer modes, such as a 2-player versus local game, and unlike the first game Tap Tap Revenge 2 allows players to go online and compete against each other around the globe. The last multiplayer mode--which isn't really what one'd call a multiplayer game--is the ability to play a song, and then e-mail your score to a friend, who can then try to best that score.Song ListCharm City Devils- 10,000 MilesCharm City Devils- Let's Rock-N-RollSaving Abel- 18 DaysPheonix- 1901School Boy Humor- Camera ShySchool Boy Humor- Cheating MyselfSchool Boy Humor- Everyone Who BreathesStill Lost Bird Music- Chocolate HeartMatt Nathanson- Come On Get HigherThieves Like Us- DesireSarah Borges- Do It For FreeVincent Van Go Go- Don't GoVincent Van Go Go- Swiss TunnelVincent Van Go Go- Do You KnowA Cursive Memory- EverythingA Cursive Memory- BankAnberlin- Feel Good DragMorgan Page- Fight For YouJason Damato- Floating Down A RiverThat Was Something- For the FameThat Was Something- She Is The West CoastSenses Fail- Four YearsSenses Fail- Calling All CarsSenses Fail- Buried A LieSenses Fail- Can't Be SavedSenses Fail- Bite To Break SkinSenses Fail- Lungs Like GallowsSenses Fail- Rum Is For Drinking, Not For BurningSenses Fail- Wolves At The DoorSenses Fail- Garden StateAll American Rejects- Gives You HellThe Kin- Go (Go Your Way)Anarbor- Halfway SoberAnarbor- Let the Games BeginAnarbor- Where The Wild Things Are (Monsters)Winston Giles- Harder And FasterWinston Giles- She Wants To Be Adored311- Hey YouThe Ettes- I Heard TellPitbull- I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)Stroke 9- It's Curtains For YouStroke 9- Little Black BackpackStroke 9- Tap Tap DomiNationStroke 9- Who I AmStroke 9- The OneStroke 9- The Yeah SongReggie  The Full Effect- JReggie  The Full Effect- Congratulations Smack  KatyJET- K.I.A.JET- She's A GeniusJET- Start The ShowBen Harper- Keep It TogetherBen Harper- Steal My KissesAardvark- KutwellAsher Roth- Lark On My Go-KartKudu- Leave Me AloneBecca- Liquid SmogBecca- Sad But TrueSlow Runner- Lower your StandardsBrooke Waggoner- Lungs Speed, Lungs SpedBrooke Waggoner- DayloverAFI- MedicatePanic!
