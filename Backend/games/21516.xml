To compensate for that, the player starts out with 50 lives, instead of 3-5 in normal platformer games.Rafael is only given a dagger which hits enemies at close range, and some enemies are impervious to it and can only be killed by having a block fall on top of them. Rafael can push certain objects throughout the game to accomplish his goal. In some rooms, the prince can only advance to the next room by aligning various steeping stones in the correct places to advance the room including: cement blocks, honey jars, candles, and the elevator.ItemsTo advance from room-to-room, the player must carry a key that matches the color of the door they intend to open. Pink key opens the pink door, blue key to blue door.. and so on and so forth. There are 6 key colors in total:RedBlueLight BluePinkGreenand Yellow.Items in the game such as rings, crosses, money bags, and pieces of treasure add a point score though do not contribute towards helping the player complete the game.Air pack: A few of these can be found in various rooms of the game, and allows Rafael to breathe underwater for a brief period of time.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42956">Lutter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361200-nes_castlequest.jpg</image></root>
