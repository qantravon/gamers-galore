As a RAH-66 Comanche pilot, you were assigned to various anti-terrorism campaigns, ranging from escort missions to search and destroy missions. The gameplay was a mixture of simulation flying and first-person shooting, creating a unique mechanic that few games have tried since.  Graphics Comanche 4's graphics were highly praised. Using an engine based on new voxel technology (the Voxel Space engine), the developers were able to create much more detailed and realistic terrain than in any other game at the time. The environment reacted to the helicopters presence; grass and trees swayed, crewman ducked and shielded their faces and dust kicked up as your helicopter approached the ground. Also noteworthy were the detailed explosions due to the use of voxel technology.  Sequel While Comanche 4 was received fairly well by critics, and development of Comanche 5 was well underway, it eventually was canceled in late 2004 due to the U.S. military's stoppage of the RAH-66 program.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11478">Comanche: Maximum Overkill</game><game id="20091">Jane's Combat Simulations: AH-64D Longbow</game><game id="37289">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark 2</game><game id="14098">Enemy Engaged: RAH-66 Comanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum</game><game id="39084">Enemy Engaged 2</game><game id="3172">Gunship!</game><game id="32297">Ace Combat Assault Horizon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/703898-comanche4_front.jpg</image></root>
