John will consume air if he stays in these areas, and will consume it a lot faster if he shoots a firearm. Should the oxygen run out in a room John will die. "Air grenades" can be found to replenish a room's air, as can first aid kits which will heal John's health and appear very similar to Resident Evil's first aid sprays. Deep Fear's shooting takes place in third-person from varying camera angles, due to every screen in the game having a unique fixed position for it's camera. The game is also known for it's generally sub-par voice acting, much like the original Resident Evil.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5842">Resident Evil</game><game id="9418">Resident Evil 2</game><game id="377">Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</game><game id="8804">Condemned: Criminal Origins</game><game id="27715">Resident Evil</game><game id="39916">B.L.U.E.
