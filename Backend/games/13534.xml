<root><id>13534</id><name>Kururin Paradise</name><description>The second in the Kururin franchise, Paradise involves navigating complex levels with a constantly-rotating robot. Spring objects within levels change the direction of rotation when collided with, and an unlockable ability allows for increasing the speed of rotation. The player has three hit points. After three collisions with objects in the level (discounting the aforementioned springs), the level is re-started. Some levels have intermediate points that replenish health fully. However, they do not save progress. If the player loses all of his or her hit points, they still restart the level from the beginning.Almost all of the game is in Japanese.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16403">Helious</game><game id="17253">Irritating Stick</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/782162-kururinparadise.jpg</image></root>
