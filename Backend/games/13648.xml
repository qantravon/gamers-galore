<root><id>13648</id><name>Code name Hell Squad</name><description>Known as Hellpigs before its release, Code name Hell Squad is an adventure game with some action elements. Instead of pointing and clicking on the screen to move the character players manipulate him with the joystick or keyboard, and can also shoot at enemies or pick up and use items.Similar to The Cave, Hell Squad features multiple playable characters. Players can switch between the four squad members at any time. This is useful because squad members regenerate health when they are left alone and, more importantly, can pass items between each other at will (unlike, for comparison, The Cave). This mechanic plays out in many instances, such as finding a key with one squad member and passing it to one who is trapped.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
