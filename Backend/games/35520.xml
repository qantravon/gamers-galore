Payday features six different scenarios in which the players must cooperate in order to complete the given objectives, with settings ranging from a bank, to a prison, to a corporate office building. All of the scenarios are independent of each other and can be played in any order, and there is no overarching narrative.Players can choose to play as either an assault, sharpshooter, or support class. Each class can be leveled up over the course of play, and as new levels are reached, new weapons, items, and abilities become accessible. Abilities affected by the leveling system include healing, ammunition dispersal, and binding hostages. Respawns are determined by the number of hostages the player is willing to trade. Objective locations and path requirements vary from session to session, and some optional objectives become available at times that, while not required, can speed up the players' progress in the mission when completed.Over the course of a mission, the police will come in waves and the AI will adapt based on the player's performance. Police officers utilize a variety of armaments, including smoke bombs and tasers, and some wear heavy armor, requiring more firepower in order to successfully take them down.CharactersThere are four different playable characters:Wolf (Bloody mouth mask)Dallas (American flag mask)Chains (Vertical eyes slit mask)Hoxton (Droopy face mask)LevelsThere are six different levels, or "Heists," as the game calls them:First World BankHeat StreetPanic RoomGreen BridgeDiamond HeistSlaughterhouseDownloadable ContentOn August 7th, 2012, DLC titled "Wolfpack" was released for the game.
