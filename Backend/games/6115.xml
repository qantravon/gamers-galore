Gameplay is similar to Warhawk and Terminal Velocity, though with relatively confined mission areas and a fast moving jet, the player has little margin for error, as moving out of mission bounds result in instant death.The game and it's expansion pack Operation Jumpgate were later re-released in one package for the PlayStation, PC and Pippin under the name Shockwave Assault.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17169">Warhawk</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73970/1286293-shockwave_au_front.jpg</image></root>
