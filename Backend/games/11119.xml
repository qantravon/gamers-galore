Crystal, who always accompanies Madison, can switch between shooting left and right. Crystal acts as a sort of option, as she takes no damage and only dies when Madison dies.Players choose a weapon at the beginning of every stage, but weapons must be recharged (weapon will be unavailable for the next stage) before another use.There are four different power-ups in the game: Firepower, Speed Up, Speed Down, and Life Up.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14220">Forgotten Worlds</game><game id="566">S.C.A.T.: Special Cybernetic Attack Team</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389607-genesis_troubleshooter.jpg</image></root>
