AppStore ControversyMaciej Biedrzycki, a Codeminion employee, created a blog post on October 23 announcing they had recieved a complaint filed by MumboJumbo, creators of the similar franchise Luxor. In the post, Biedrzycki goes on to say that MumboJumbo has accused Codeminion of "infringing Luxor copyright, confusing customers, stealing Luxorâ€™s look and feel, and even stealing their source code". While it is true that StoneLoops will appear when 'Luxor' is typed into the AppStore search bar, the claim of stolen source code has yet to be verified.According to Codeminion, Apple approached the Luxor developers asking if removal of said quote from the Codeminion website would allow the complaint to be dropped, but MumboJumbo persisted and StoneLoops of Jurassica was removed from the AppStore. As of November 18, StoneLoops is still missing from the store.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17012">Zuma</game><game id="13308">Luxor</game><game id="11623">Tumblebugs</game><game id="5040">Magnetica</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6347/1098304-img_0681.png</image></root>
