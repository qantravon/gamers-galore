Unfortunately, the game was canceled but a demo of the beta build of Bounty Arms was discovered by Kid Fenris from the Lost Levels forum. The demo was found on the fifth volume of Demo Demo Playstation, a line of discs used in Japanese store kiosks from 1994 through 1997. The demo features half of the game's first level but does not allow either character to take damage. A promotional video along with many magazine scans of Bounty Arms have also been uploaded to the internet, which can be found at Unseen 64 and Kid Fenris' blog.GameplayBounty Arms is an overhead action game with a perspective similar to Ikari Warriors and Mercs. Players control Rei and Chris, two women who wield mechanical arms called Relic Arms. A Relic Arm is basically a giant whip that can be used to attack enemies, deflect bullets, reach across gap, and create a large fire ring when the player holds down the attack button. Bounty Arms was also going to have a co-op mode that was never finished.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6850">Commando</game><game id="3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</game><game id="10360">Mercs</game><game id="1619">Ikari Warriors</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5450/897627-bounty.jpg</image></root>
