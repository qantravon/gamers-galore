During the game, Gohan is telling Goten stories about                    Goku, his father, who died before he was born. As each story                    is told, it is your job to play out the battles as they occurred                    in the series. Cinematics help to tell the stories in graphic                    detail. Other characters from the series will occasionally come                    to help Gohan tell the stories. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5317/283014-tglabel.jpg</image></root>
