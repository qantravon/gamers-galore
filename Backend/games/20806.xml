Romero wrote all the text and dialogue for the GBC version. The game didn't make it to the US market but instead only made it to PAL regions.The GBC version was more well received than its 3D counterpart.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2388">StarTropics</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1975582-cover.png</image></root>
