Players would use footage provided in the game to create a music video to either "Jump", "I Missed The Bus", or "Warm It Up."When the Make My Video series went into development, Digital Pictures operated under the assumption that music video shoots produced a wealth of unused footage, which would serve to populate the series' core gameplay mechanic. However, they soon discovered that this was not the case. Instead, they populated the non-music video footage options with royalty-free videos, including political speeches and black-and-white stock films.ReceptionThe game was met with universal disdain from the enthusiast press, and even made Seanbaby's Crapstravaganza list of the 20 worst games of all time at #18.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10517">Make My Video: INXS</game><game id="18613">Power Factory Featuring C+C Music Factory</game><game id="5307">Make My Video: Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch</game><game id="13898">Moderngroove: Ministry of Sound Edition</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117445/1681403-img156.jpg</image></root>
