It is notable for being the first "pure" adventure game in history that was set in a real 3D world; sprites or digitized images are used instead of 3D models, effectively making it a "2.5D game" visually similar to DOOM. Uncommonly for adventure games, Under A Killing Moon allows full maneuverability. The player can rotate the camera, change the viewing angle, zoom in and out, etc.; it is even possible to look for clues underneath desks, chairs, etc. Other features include an online hint system (that decreases the player's score with each use), extensive support for additional sound/music devices, and full-motion video technology: cutscenes and much of the dialogue are presented as movies with real actors.</description><genres><genre>Adventure</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10241-1.jpg</image></root>
