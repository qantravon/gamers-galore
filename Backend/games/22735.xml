However, it should be noted that very few of the characters have voice acting. The gameplay is relatively simple, and it is targeting the 'casual' gaming market. There are pranks and office competitons as the two main events. Though the game was released on the PC in November 2007, it is currently being ported to Xbox Live Arcade, Nintendo DS, Playstation 2, and the Nintendo Wii (through WiiWare).</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11300/448273-the_office_vg_gp5.jpg</image></root>
