However, unlike in previous Yoshi games, this does not produce a Yoshi-egg that will then be used as a projectile weapon, it causes Yoshi to become a more corporeal, solid Yoshi. Like in Kirby's Epic Yarn, the original yarn Yoshi can run into enemies without consequence and they will act like he is not even there. Once Yoshi turns solid, though, they will run away in fear since Yoshi can now harm them.Not much more has been shown so far, although the doors leading "behind" the fabric from the Kirby game seem to be back and collecting gems seems to be a focus again as well. The game is played on a 2D plane but the camera shifts to a 2.5D perspective in some of the released screenshots.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31730">Kirby's Epic Yarn</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2419601-i68uufqcifxtn.jpg</image></root>
