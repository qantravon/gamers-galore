<root><id>10776</id><name>Operation: Overkill II</name><description>Combat Different versions of Overkill had one of two combat mechanics. These were timing and reflex based with the added twist of connection speed affecting success.  The space bar was used to stop the "gauge" and determine a hit, the effectiveness of the hit, or a miss.   Method 1 used numbers, usually 1 to 7.  The target number was displayed, then the counter would display the numbers in ascending or descending order.  The goal was to come closest to the target number for the best hit...........1..........2...........3..........4...........5..........6..........7.........  Method 2 used letters A-B-C and was generally more forgiving.  The target letter was displayed, then the counter would display the letters in ascending or descending order, and any letter could appear first.  The addition of a buffer zone and the overall speed of the gauge was affected by the player character's level and combat ability. ........aaAaa........bbBbb........ccCcc.......aaAaa........bbBbb........ccCcc.......</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23902">TradeWars 2002</game><game id="15201">Legend of the Red Dragon</game><game id="32244">The Pit</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
