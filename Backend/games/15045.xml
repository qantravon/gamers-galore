However, it was later ported to Game Gear and that version was sold internationally.A notable feature of this game's original Master System release is that it included a special dial-like paddle controller: The type of device that all Arcade games of the Breakout sub-genre used, such as Warlords and Arkanoid (and Breakout itself). The Game Gear version would not require this special controller, instead substituting in the portable system's normal D-pad controls.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/1516838-586860_39278_front.jpg</image></root>
