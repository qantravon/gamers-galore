Instead, the robots that must be destroyed are Stardroids, who have come from outer space to prey on the Earth.StardroidsMercury (gives Grab Buster)Neptune (gives Salt Water)Mars (gives Photon Missile)Venus (gives Bubble Bombs)Pluto (gives Break Dash)Uranus (gives Deep Digger)Jupiter (gives Electric Shock)Saturn (gives Black Hole)Terra (gives Spark Chaser)Other robots fought in this game include Dark Moon (a Yellow Demon-like robot,) along with Enker, Quint, Punk, and Ballade (all four from the previous Game Boy Mega Man titles.) Dr. Wily does indeed make an appearance in this game, even though he does not at first appear to be involved. Though the player does fight against him, he is not the final boss of the game. The final boss is Sunstar, leader of the Stardroids.New FeaturesMega Man V includes a new support unit in addition to the older Rush and Beat . This new robot is a cat named Tango, who functions similarly to how Beat did in older games, moving about the screen and attacking enemies. Also, in MMV the charged buster is replaced with the Mega Arm, which fires out a fist projectile with a limited range. This Mega Arm can be upgraded to grab enemies for extra hits and also to pick up distant items.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27310">Action Man: Search for Base X</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1806090-box_mmgb5.png</image></root>
