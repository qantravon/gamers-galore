Vol. 2: Reminisce left off. Haseo fails to kill Ovan, and an AIDA-infested Sakaki has returned as well with only vengeance on the brain. There are problems within the G.U. and CC Corp. that are ever increasing the difficulties faced in the game combined with the problem of AIDA. A brand new tournament has opened as well, causing more scares amongst players of  The World.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1695">.hack//G.U.
