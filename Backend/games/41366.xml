In order to do so, they must "hold the diamond" by controlling its movement with their finger. If the player loses control of the diamond for a moment, the game ends. While holding the diamond, the player must steer it clear of missile assaults, giant squids, large walls, and must use it to attack bosses.When bosses are defeated, the player earns coins which can be used to revive in the middle of the playthrough. The baseline for revives is 300 coins. These coins can also be purchased via  in-app purchases, going as high as $5.99 for 20000 coins.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2420644-mzl.mubnvuja.png</image></root>
