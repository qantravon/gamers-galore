It is an unlicensed title, and is actually a censored version of an earlier unlicensed title,  Bubble Bath Babes. Clusters of multi colored bubbles travel up the screen and the player has to try to get groups of four or more of the same color to clear those bubbles and score points. This can cause some neighboring bubbles to move upward, creating situations that allow for multiple combos.Â  FeaturesTwo Player ModeFour Stages Three Difficulty LevelsFive Speed LevelsThree Different Background Tunes</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19017">Super Bust-A-Move</game><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="15214">Bubble Bath Babes</game><game id="5487">Columns</game><game id="17641">Dr. Mario</game><game id="3289">Hot Slot</game><game id="15655">Peek-A-Boo Poker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/220464-mermaids_of_atlantis.jpg</image></root>
