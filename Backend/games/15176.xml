Once every platform on the map has been marked, the game continues to the next stage.The player is not able to stop, but can change direction instantaneously and jump to avoid enemies coming at them, and also to reach higher platforms. The levels scroll either direction, so the player may choose to reverse their course if there's a particularly high concentration of enemies ahead.Each set of levels is varied by their appearance, with different graphical indications of where you have been.The game is an adaptation of Jaleco's classic City Connection, for the NES.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13232">City Connection</game><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/651173-1220198260_00.png</image></root>
