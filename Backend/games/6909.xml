Gameplay The craft under the player's control is armed with a laser, which fires continuously while the fire button is held down, and an unlimited supply of bombs which are released with every individual press of the fire button.  The craft is also equipped with a shield which can be powered up for extended periods, but which needs time to recharge between uses. If damage is sustained to the craft, the ship is not instantly destroyed.  Instead, armaments are removed one by one.  The first hit removes the shield, leaving the craft more vulnerable.  The second hit removes the laser, leaving only the bombs as offensive weapons.  The third hit destroys the craft.  Damage could be repaired at the end of a stage by successfully landing the craft on a platform, upon which the pilot would disembark and take an elevator down to a fresh, undamaged ship.  Certain platforms would be risky to land upon, as some of the landing pads were guarded by an intermittent burst of energy that could destroy a ship that landed at the wrong time.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13745">R-Type</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8272/1357569-gatesofzendocon_front.jpg</image></root>
