It is one of the early adopters of the    Move Controller as well as utilizing    stereoscopic 3D. The game consists of fast action    top-down shooting, collecting    gems and using    powerups using competitive score-boarding and timers as the main push to the game.    The idea is that the players pilot Drones through the galaxy to collect parts of 'Equilibrix' that is supposedly meant to stabilize the universe and prevent the expansions of 'G-Noids'.    The PS3 version will have a future update that will add stereoscopic 3D.HistoryStarDrone was first seen on the Orb Games limited flash portal www.tastyplay.com, then moved to    Big Fish Games. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35657">Rotastic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1736090-stardrone_feature.jpg</image></root>
