There are a total of 100 races to partake in. At the end of each race, the player is given a star rating. He is rated on which place he finished in and how many of the side objectives he completed during the race (accumulate a certain amount of drift points, do a certain number of jumps...). There are different types of events, from straightforward lap races to elimination races. Races can also be taken online with up to four players.Acceleration is handled with the R button while boost and drift are mapped on the face buttons. During races, players accumulate adrenaline by picking up power-ups and driving recklessly. Adrenaline is the game's boost and it can be used whenever the adrenaline bar is full. Players are rewarded for finding shortcuts or taking down other racers.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24103">Asphalt: Urban GT 2</game><game id="38497">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</game><game id="35647">Ridge Racer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2114367-box_asphalti.png</image></root>
