<root><id>3845</id><name>After Burner III</name><description>OverviewControl an F-14 Tomcat through over twelve levels of dogfights and air-to-ground combat.  Use of the Vulcan machine gun and missiles, as well as a turbo boost from the After Burner make for an exhilarating, though sometimes chugging flight. Critical ReceptionWhen released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of  4,6,5,7 adding, "...After Burner has long been the forefather to arcade dogfighting, and After Burner III is no exception.  This is a welcome addition to my Sega CD lineup".  A second reviewer though disagreed stating, "...the music is good but even the opening animations are unimpressive, with minor scaling and rotation.  The game play needs some work...". TriviaThe game was also known as Strike Fighter, which it was known as in the Japanese arcades before being adapted to become an After Burner sequel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22852">1941: Counter Attack</game><game id="3629">After Burner</game><game id="3142">Blue Lightning</game><game id="38156">F1 Tornado</game><game id="13742">G-Loc Air Battle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11174/288482-after_burner_3__u_.png</image></root>
