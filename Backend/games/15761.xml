<root><id>15761</id><name>Radar Mission</name><description>Gameplay  This  Battleship- like  game requires that the player hits the enemy boats without knowing where they are. The enemy also gets to try and destroy you're ships, which is unlikely due to the poorly written A.I. Players may make it even more unlikely by setting the options to "rare hits" Where the bots hitting chances are lower.  </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5356">Battleship</game><game id="16290">Battleship: The Classic Naval Warfare Game</game><game id="9193">Battleship: Surface Thunder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/783178-585872_38698_front.jpg</image></root>
