<root><id>12657</id><name>Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai</name><description>Temple Of Apshai is one of the first graphical RPGs ever commercially released, originally for the TRS80 back in 1979. Heavily influenced by DnD, players equip their character with gear, and head into dungeons to loot the treasure chests within. Fighting, movement and object manipulation is all handled with one-key presses, so the action is relatively uncomplicated by modern standards, but there is no denying the game's place as one of the key relics of gaming history.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9589">Akalabeth: World of Doom</game><game id="16408">Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness</game><game id="9180">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</game><game id="25832">Dungeon Campaign / Wilderness Campaign</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/540190-cover150dpi_1_.jpg</image></root>
