After numerous wars and several environmental disasters, only two world powers remain; the United Civilized States (UCS) covering the American continent, Western Europe and North Africa, and the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) covering the coherent landmasses of Eastern Europe and Asia.   The damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities. Australia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there. Most of the world's population forgot that this land ever existed.   Conflicts between UCS and the ED escalated and became the final world war. This war will decide who will get the last of the available natural resources and ultimately rule the world.       PC System Requirements   Windows XP or Windows Vista  1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended)  256MB RAM (512 recommended)  3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)  Mouse  Keyboard.    </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4608">World War III: Black Gold</game><game id="16970">Earth 2160</game><game id="39722">Tryst</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/1701396-mac_earth2140.jpg</image></root>
