Someone suggested SPISPOPD as an example of a name that was too unwieldy to catch on.  As tends to happen, people went crazy with it. The developers went and decided to have some fun with it and made this game. As an interesting side note, the game was reportedly made in 48 hours. The game play was as simple as possible:  you play a man attacking killer pumpkins with an axe.  The levels incorporate a lot of mazes and basic puzzles, and periodically a giant pumpkin boss. Popular CultureNote that these are references to SPISPOPD, though most are a result of   DOOM, not SPISPOPD the game.idspispopd was the no clipping cheat code in the original DOOM .There was a dialog reference in the first DOOM novel.The Smashing Pumpkins included a DOOM sample in "Where Boys Fear to Tread"</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11534/335159-smash.gif</image></root>
