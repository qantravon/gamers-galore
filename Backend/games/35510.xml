Both will also feature a new voice cast for all of the characters, who will be directed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, who had previously provided vocals for tracks featured across the series. The original voice cast of Silent Hill 2 have also signed waivers to allow their voice-overs to be used in the updated Silent Hill 2, and so the original voices will be available as an alternative option.</description><genres><genre id="15">Compilation</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9418">Resident Evil 2</game><game id="39248">God of War Saga</game><game id="40089">Outlast</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2132187-box_shhdc.png</image></root>
