<root><id>39641</id><name>Cinders</name><description>OverviewCinders is a visual novel (self described as an atmospheric visual novel) developed by MoaCube, a Polish developer, based on the fairy tale Cinderella. Their main intention in development were to make the characters deeper and to make the main character more proactive, rather than her lucking into falling in love with the prince and living happily ever after. It's also harder to do this, due to the amount of choices in the game; there's 120 decision points, and most of these decisions impact things, however slight, even dictating Cinders' personality. The script was written by Ayu Sakata.System RequirementsPC System Requirements:Core 2 Duo 3 GHz2 GB RAMGraphic Card 256 MB (GeForce 9500 GT or better)1.75 GB HDDWindows 7(SP1)Mac System Requirements:Intel Macs with at least OS X 10.5</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42339">Heileen</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81005/2368105-timthumb.png</image></root>
