Unlike Mortal Kombat it featured 2D sprites rather than digitized characters, but it featured similar amounts of blood and violence. It was a success in arcades presumably because of controversies surrounding it. BloodStorm is most notable for featuring Daniel Pesina, the actor who portrayed    Johnny Cage in the first   Mortal Kombat and  Mortal Kombat II, in advertisements.
