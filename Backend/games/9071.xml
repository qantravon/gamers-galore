The Silver Zephyr, Count Cannoli, has a wand, Goodstyle, which allows him to create different disguises so he can became a master of disguise. With greed in his mind, Wario sets out to get into the TV Show and steal the Goodstyle wand and loot the world. After being successful in retrieving the wand, Wario sets out to loot as much as he can only to stumble upon a Wishstone. Each Wishstone grants a wish, and so begins a race between Count Cannoli and Wario to retrieve all five Wishstones.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8224">New Super Mario Bros.</game><game id="1239">Kirby: Squeak Squad</game><game id="10347">Yoshi's Island DS</game><game id="23692">Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?</game><game id="6282">Drawn to Life</game><game id="9882">Super Princess Peach</game><game id="25552">Mighty Flip Champs</game><game id="23282">Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure</game><game id="20748">Super Mario Bros. 3: Super Mario Advance 4</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6087/596537-wario.jpg</image></root>
