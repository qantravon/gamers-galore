<root><id>27299</id><name>Supreme Ruler 2020</name><description>OverviewDeveloped by BattleGoat Studios, Supreme Ruler 2020 allows players to take control of a nation of the world or in some scenarios fragmented regions of former nations. The player is challenged to dominate the world based on either scenario goals or chosen victory conditions. The gameplay targets the more "epic" approach where campaigns can be played over multiple sessions taking days or even weeks to complete. The near future setting allows players to play known regions of the world with a certain degree of familiarity.The final release version of Supreme Ruler 2020 was version 5.6.2. Work continued on the series through an expansion pack. The core game plus expansion pack have since been released as a Gold Edition.PC System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows® 98/Me/2000/XP/Vista/Windows® 7Processor: Pentium III 800 or higherMemory: 512MB RAMGraphics: 3D Graphics Card with 16MB Video RAMDirectX®: DirectX 8.1 (included) or HigherSound: DirectX Compatible Sound Card</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9617">Supreme Ruler 2010</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331144-box_sr2020.png</image></root>
