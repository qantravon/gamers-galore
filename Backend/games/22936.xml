The game attracted controversy for its portrayal of the popular drinking game beer pong, which has been referenced as encouraging binge drinking. The game's original title, Frat Party Games: Beer Pong, was changed in order to lessen the negative connotation associated with the game, and to make it more conformant to the traditionally "kid friendly" Wii system.The game was later ported to the PlayStation 3 on October 22, 2013, with updated graphics and PS Move support.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26885">Ultimate Party Challenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/589795-qqns_r5njp5_axnl5i6zbuw_uz6sgt6_.jpg</image></root>
