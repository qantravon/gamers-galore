It is the spiritual follow up to Future Wars (Les voyageurs du temps: la menace) using the same user interface and controls.On the Amiga the game is most notable for having spoken lines in places using synthesized speech. This is only available if you have more than 1MB of RAM.There is also some confusion regarding the name, as noted above. The game was released in the U.S. under the name James Bond: The Stealth Affair however it was not possible to get the James Bond license in Europe and was then renamed Operation Stealth. However it is probable assume that the game wasnâ€™t initially intended to be released as a James Bond game since the storyline features many contradictions to the James Bond character (for instance, being employed by CIA).StoryThe game begins in Washington where James Bond (John Glames in the European version) arrives at the CIA Headquarters. He is told that an ultra-modern aircraft has been stolen and may have been landed in Santa Paragua. Glames catches a flight to Santa Paragua and begins his search for the missing aircraft.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36097">Assault Dragon: The Day 5</game><game id="600">Future Wars</game><game id="3942">Cruise for a Corpse</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/905334-picture_3.png</image></root>
