To do this, he must collect income while avoiding the red tape scattered around the environment. At the end of each quarter, he must carefully manage his investments by meeting with his investment advisor, Toodles, who will maximize his tax-sheltered investment returns. He can then proceed to talk to a certified public accountant called Waggie who will charge a fee of $1,000 in order to upgrade his tax-sheltered investments. However, he must always be careful not to run into Eggie, the IRS agent who will audit him resulting in fines of half of his current balance.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12642">Porky's</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5911/946240-taxavoid.jpg</image></root>
