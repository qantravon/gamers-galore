<root><id>35961</id><name>Tamori's Picross</name><description>Tamori's Picross (or Tamori no Picross) was a Picross game very similar to Mario's Super Picross broadcast over the Satellaview network in Japan each week from April 23 until September 9 1995. The broadcasts coincided with a radio show named "Sunday Seminar with Dr. Tamorosu Sabachichikarejji" and while the game was named after Japanese celebrity Tamori, he did not appear in the actual game. The puzzles were re-broadcast until March 1996.Little else is known about the game. By the very nature of Satellaview it's very difficult to track down working copies of the game (the first dumps only started appearing in early 2010) and the only official information is on this page on Jupiter's website.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6944">Mario's Super Picross</game><game id="39587">Simple 1500 Series Hello Kitty Vol. 02: Hello Kitty Illust Puzzle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2104/1844449-tamori_title.jpg</image></root>
