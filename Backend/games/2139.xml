The cockpit was built on hydraulics, which simulated flight by moving the player roughly 25 degrees in both a horizontal and vertical axis, in a rough representation of the fighter's in-game movement. As the cockpit was enclosed on almost all sides, spectators who stood too close to the moving cockpit could be injured, so large screens (simulcasting the gameplay) were frequently mounted above the cabinet. This deluxe version often cost upward of $1.00USD for a single credit.Stereo speakers were placed at the ear level for the deluxe cabinet version, creating a very immersive (and sometimes deafening) play experience. The arcade controls consisted of a flight stick with multiple buttons and a throttle stick which could be used to slow down the aircraft or activate it's afterburners. The addition of the throttle was the most notable change from the original After Burner.There 23 stages in the game: Stages 5, 13 and 23 are non-playable landing cutscenes and levels 8 and 17 are canyon bombing runs. The remaining stages involve air to air combat using an unlimited cannon, and a limited supply of missiles. The missile supply is restored approximately every 2-3 levels in a non-playable air-air refuelling sequence, as well as in the first two landing cutscenes. Cameo's from the vehicles in Hang-On, and Out Run, make appearances during the first two landing cutscenes, driving down the runway in front of the F-14 as it is taking off.Points were rewarded for both distance traveled and enemies destroyed. For unknown reasons, the designers decided to reward players with literally millions of points for performing any sort of action in the game, making the high score table sometimes showing players with scores in the billions.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11696">Captain Skyhawk</game><game id="13742">G-Loc Air Battle</game><game id="22852">1941: Counter Attack</game><game id="3605">Ace Combat 2</game><game id="19273">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</game><game id="20037">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</game><game id="9920">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</game><game id="17336">Lock On</game><game id="23098">M.A.C.H. 3</game><game id="3629">After Burner</game><game id="3142">Blue Lightning</game><game id="38156">F1 Tornado</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2368941-genesis_afterburner2_eu.jpg</image></root>
