The USA and USSR have  joined forces as the ISDF (International Space Defense Force) against  the Scions, an alien race that has begun terrorizing the edges of the  solar system. An investigation of an attack on    Pluto reveals a "Dark  Planet," and players, as Lt. John Cooke, are tasked with carrying out  various missions there.GameplayBattlezone II is a unique mix of first-person shooter, vehicle shooter, and real-time strategy. For example, the player can pilot a vehicle around the map, then hop out, enter a building, and command forces from an overhead perspective. Tasks like directing units and building structures can be done from any mode with the help of the function keys, which are bound to unit groups and constructor units. Basic real-time strategy elements are present in the game, such as   tech trees and  harvesting resources to build units.ReceptionWhile pre-launch enthusiasm for the game was high, this quickly dissipated upon release. Buggy gameplay and steep system requirements marred the game's reputation, even after a significant number of issues were alleviated by patches. The game still managed to receive a few positive reviews, but did not sell particularly well.LegacyAfter Pandemic Studios ceased patching Battlezone II after version 1.2, Pandemic programmers Nathan Mates and Ken Miller released      patch 1.3, an unofficial patch that they developed in their spare time. Patch 1.3 enabled user-created mods, which the programmers hoped would foster a dedicated mod community and increase popularity of the game. Today, a few active mod communities remain, including           Battlezone II Mod Development,          Battlezone Universe, and the     Battlezone II Map Room.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="249">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</game><game id="24943">Uprising X</game><game id="38485">Digital Combat Simulator: Combined Arms</game><game id="23315">Carrier Command: Gaea Mission</game><game id="10683">Uprising: Join or Die</game><game id="16260">Uprising 2: Lead and Destroy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23546/863564-battlezone_ii___combat_commander_coverart.png</image></root>
