<root><id>33650</id><name>The Young Ones</name><description>The Young Oneswas a British television show that originally aired in 1982. This game from Orpheus attempts to take some of the broad character traits and a few direct references from that show and drop it into an adventure game.  The game allows you to play as any one of the four main characters from the series, and the action is carried out via a menu system that lets you move to different rooms and interact with various objects. A "talk" function is also included, which usually causes your character to give some sort of clue about a way that you can interact with the world.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1671103-youngonesc64.jpg</image></root>
