It is the first in Hudson's long-running series of the same name. The goal is for each player to drive a train around a board by rolling a die and trying to make as much money as possible, a la board games like Monopoly or the Game of Life.The game and its series is not to be confused with Momotaro Densetsu, an earlier RPG from Hudson featuring the same characters.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39818">Tetsudou-Oh</game><game id="40208">Momotaro Dentetsu DS: Tokyo &amp; Japan</game><game id="40214">Momotaro Dentetsu Jr.</game><game id="40217">Momotaro Dentetsu G: Gold Deck o Tsukure!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/558289-momotarou_dentetsu_box.jpg</image></root>
