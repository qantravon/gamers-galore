The goal is to defeat a demon using a multi-pronged sword which requires some assembling before the final battle.The game is a spiritual successor of sorts to Taito's earlier The Legend of Kage, as it shares a similar sense of speed and high-leaping action. The game is also quite reminiscent of Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden games, with the difficult to avoid enemies and the array of ninja powers at Victar's command.Though the game did receive an American version, it was greatly reduced in size to fit onto the standard 2mb cart. This includes losing almost half the stages in the game, several of the powers and a newly truncated ending sequence. Demon Sword's cover also inexplicably features a tanned western barbarian, rather than the svelte pale figure in red the game depicts.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14416">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</game><game id="10701">The Legend of Kage</game><game id="3506">Werewolf: The Last Warrior</game><game id="12568">Master Chu And The Drunkard Hu</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361653-nes_demonsword.jpg</image></root>
