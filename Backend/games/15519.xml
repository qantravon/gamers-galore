<root><id>15519</id><name>Dragon Castle</name><description>Dragon Castle was  a PC based game released in 1999. The game takes place in a standard medieval era, with you fighting against enemies who have invaded your land. To emerge victorious you must destroy the enemy castles using dragons. Each level has different objectives, including the 'cookie cutter' search for a princess.   Of the twenty levels that appear in the game, the nineteenth level is most commonly regarded as the hardest, as it pits you against a much stronger opposing force and tells you to eliminate all the hostiles to succeed. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14708">Sword Master</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
