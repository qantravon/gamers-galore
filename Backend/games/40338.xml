The protagonist makes their way through a horizontally-looping level by climbing up to the exit, defeating enemies along the way. There's a few RPG elements too, such as gaining experience points to level up and grow stronger as well as finding extra treasures and power-ups hidden inside chests, including a set of sub-weapons that more or less mirror the ones found in Castlevania. These are powered by a replenishable "WP" stat, similar to hearts.Matou no Houkai is Carry Soft's (or Carry Laboratory's) second and final game for the Famicom Disk System after Mystery Quest, and also the last game it ever developed. It closed its doors shortly afterwards.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16241">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2357843-matou_no_houkai_fds.jpg</image></root>
