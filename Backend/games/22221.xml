It is a platformer with puzzle and action elements. It was released as an arcade game in 1983, and was never released for any other platforms. The game was later ported to the NES as Super Arabian in 1985. Its Middle-Eastern setting is often thought to be an inspiration for the Prince of Persia series, but the gameplay between the titles is very different.GameplaySome levels are familiar to Arabian stories.The player controls an Arabian prince who must make his way through multiple levels and settings to save a princess. The prince will journey through deserts, castles, ships at sea, and many other environments. The obstacles in the princes way are genies who can damage the prince when they exit their magic lamp. The genies can be defeated only if they are inside there lamp. The main goal of each level, aside from completing it, is to collect letters spelling Arabian. The players score at the end of a level will vary depending on the amount of letters collected and the order the letters are collected in. The game play stays very much the same through out the game. The final goal is to save the princess from her tower to complete the game.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7028">Super Arabian</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7439/737766-arabian_arcadeflyer.png</image></root>
