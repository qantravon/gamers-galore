The player will invariably control Napoleon and his French army in any of the conflicts depicted with the final and most difficult map being Waterloo, the battle Napoleon famously lost to the British-Dutch forces towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars.Napoleon Senki was in the midst of a wave of serious military strategy games made for the NES, which included the NES version of Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition released on the same day in Japan. Though limited by the computing power of the NES, the game is quite busy with the amount of units (which move of their own accord) the player must keep track of on the field at once. This is especially the case in the larger scale battles, where both the player and enemy sides have troops numbering in the dozens.Featured Battles1796 - Italy - First Italian campaign1798 - Egypt - Egyptian expedition1805 - Austria - War of the Third Coalition1806-07 - Spain - Peninsular War1809 - Austria - War of the Fifth Coalition1812 - Russia - Invasion of Russia1813 - Germany - War of the Sixth Coalition1815 - Belgium/The Netherlands - Battle of Waterloo</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2340050-napoleon_senki_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
