<root><id>27591</id><name>RAZE</name><description>OverviewRAZE was planned to be a 3D fighting game that featured large environments similar to Bushido Blade.  The game differentiated itself from Squaresoft's fighter by allowing up to four players fight at once.  Interplay had licensed TSR's Forgotten Realms universe in order to include many Dungeons  Dragons mechanics including weapons, spells, magical items, and other powerups.  The game never saw retail release, and while the reason was never given by Interplay, it can be assumed that it had something to do with Wizards of the Coast purchasing the Dungeons  Dragons property from TSR in 1997.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6399">Bushido Blade</game><game id="6226">Bushido Blade 2</game><game id="3712">Power Stone 2</game><game id="20100">Power Stone</game><game id="10872">Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
