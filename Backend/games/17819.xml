<root><id>17819</id><name>Jetfighter II</name><description>This flight simulator puts players in the cockpit of various US Navy fighters in an attempt to retake the west coast of the United States after it is invaded by the Soviet Union. Most missions are flown from a carrier off of San Diego, but as the campaign progresses, land bases on the mainland become available. This allows land-based fighters, like the F-16, to be used against the commies. (Note: While the F-16 is operated by the US Navy, it is only used as an aggressor, and not for combat use. However, since the game's concept is far-fetched anyway, it's best not to worry about it.) Players can fly everyone's favorite, the F-14, as well as the agile and well-rounded F/A-18. The now-defunct Northrop YF-23 Black Widow is flyable, hypothetically modified for carrier use. F-16's can be employed once land bases are recaptured. Of note is that the YF-23 can be armed with a KEM, or kinetic energy missile. These small projectiles are loaded in packs of a few dozen at a time. Although they lack warheads, they travel at extreme speeds and deliver their damage from impact, rather than explosion and fragmentation. They are unguided, but fly in a laser-straight line. Thus must be precisely aimed to be effective. They are best employed against large, slow Soviet bombers until you get the hang of them. In game, they bridge the gap between guided missiles and cannon. The KEM is based loosely on the developing technology of the hypervelocity missile.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
