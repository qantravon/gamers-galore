<root><id>41822</id><name>Need for Speed: Shift</name><description>Aimed at a hardcore gamer-style audience, Shift reverts to the touring-car simulation style of its 2007 predecessor, NFS ProStreet. Although the gameplay of these two titles are similar, Shift recreates car handling much more realistically than ProStreet, and does not contain a story. Upon starting the career mode, the player must do a lap of the track to decide on car settings. Once completed, the player is welcomed to the 'NFS Live World Series', and must earn stars in races to earn money, and unlock new races.</description><genres><genre>Racing</genre><genre>Sports</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/845-1.jpg</image></root>
