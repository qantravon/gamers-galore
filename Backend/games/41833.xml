<root><id>41833</id><name>The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II</name><description>BFMEII is a real-time strategy game. Similar to The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, the game requires that the player build a base with structures to produce units, gather resources, research upgrades, and provide defenses. Units are used to attack the enemy and defend the player's base. Players win matches by eliminating all enemy units and structures. Unlike the first game, the player can build an unlimited number of structures anywhere on the map, allowing for more freedom in base building and unit production. Players can build fortresses to defend their base. They can also construct arrow and catapult towers on building plots around a fortress to provide defensive support, and build walls adjacent to fortresses in any direction and length to provide basic protection. The game's HUD, called the Palant√≠r, shows the player's hero units and their abilities, a mini-map, and objectives.</description><genres><genre>Role-Playing</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/994-2.jpg</image></root>
