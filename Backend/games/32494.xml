Overview: This 1996                   Bloodlust Software's release is a campy gorefest fighting game similar to                       Time Killers   as it deals with the time travel topic. However Timeslaughter  is  clearly distimctive because of the excessive use of graphic and verbal     profanity. In terms of gameplay Timeslaugter is simillar to any other                      Mortal Kombat knock-off of the nineties - with special moves, 3 round bouts and                    fatalities, which involve decapitation, impalement and some more sophisticated ways of mutilating the opponent like e.g. using their intestines as bagpipes. When the battle is over each character verbally abuses the fallen foe, what is a definite highlight of the game due to a massive dose of black humor and pure stupidity involved (the same thing can be said about endings).  The game is played with 8-directional input and 6 attack buttons with weak, medium and fierce punch and kick commands. Playable characters:  10 basic fighters.     The basic roster has 10 selectable characters: -           Asylum -         Chi -             Jinsoku -            Lazarus -  Mojumbo -    Pierre -               Ug  -                 Vlad-       Savage -      Spice   Using cheats adds 4 more playable deviants: - Buddy - Portal - Ravage - Staine</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21419">Time Killers</game><game id="11807">Xenophage: Alien BloodSport</game><game id="21282">Thrill Kill</game><game id="22505">Tattoo Assassins</game><game id="32641">Executioners</game><game id="32642">Nogginknockers</game><game id="17992">Nogginknockers 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4462/1484150-225px_timeslaughter_titlescreen.jpg</image></root>
