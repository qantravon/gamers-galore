The North American release didn't come out for almost another year, assumingly to replace that pesky English with some good ol' fashioned American voices. It also removes the "with Mel B" part of the game title (probably because most American's don't know who Mel B is), and simply goes with the staggeringly generic title "Let's Dance."</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32388">Get Fit With Mel B</game><game id="27859">Just Dance</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/2299053-letsdance360.jpg</image></root>
