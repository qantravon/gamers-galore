<root><id>9304</id><name>Cyclone</name><description>After the success of Tornado Low Level the creator Costa Panayi made another flying game, this time with a helicopter instead of the previous low level flying Tornado jet.The objective in this game was less aggressive than before. You had to collect aid packages and rescue stranded residents from a series of randomly generated islands. The reason for this was an approaching cyclone, that as it got closer to the helicopter would push it around, making it harder to control.As you collected the aid packages, by hovering low over them to lower a winch down and pick them up, you used fuel which gave the game a limited time in which to be completed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7275">TLL: Tornado Low Level</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/36683/1026456-cyclone.jpg</image></root>
