Around 400 kits were produced. Despite its sequel-like name, Part II contains much of the same level design as its predecessor, though it's four levels shorter than the first game. Some weapon changes were also made, and references to a contest that appeared in the first Vindicators have been removed.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
