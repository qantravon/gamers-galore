Developed by Guy Lima, Jr. and Stefan Mikaelsson, Continuity 2 furthers the ideas presented in the original and adds iOS functionality to expand the puzzle experience. In short, the player has to rearrange the tiles to enable the character to collect a key to unlock the door. But that is only the beginning: the player may also flip the iOS device to alter the gravity in the game.There are a total of 50 levels in the current edition of Continuity 2. If you're into collecting items, then you can collect all the coins in each level. Also, the game has time attack mode which is connected with game's Game Center achievements. Sadly, the Continuity 2 currently doesn't have leader boards.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21170">Portal</game><game id="29745">VVVVVV</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/32858/2091829-004.png</image></root>
