The disc includes over 5 hours of Breakbeat, Garage, House, Techno and Trance music as mixed by DJs Tall Paul, Ferry Corsten, Paul Dakeyne, Krafty Kuts and Paul Jackson but, unfortunately, lacks any way to import music of your own. Each track has a pre-scripted "music video" but users can remix and customize the visuals using the Visual Mixer.  Visual Mixer      Through a series of menus users can rearrange 180 Animated 3D objects, 1000 unique images, 80 full 3D backgrounds, 400 original video clips, 30 Particle systems, 20 user-controllable real-time effects and even enter their own text to display on the screen.     Release Though an American release was originally planned, Ubisoft chose to focus on the European market where the names moderngroove and Ministry mean something. The game was released in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy and distributed through a total of 34 European and PAL countries.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10517">Make My Video: INXS</game><game id="10670">Make My Video: Kris Kross</game><game id="5307">Make My Video: Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch</game><game id="18613">Power Factory Featuring C+C Music Factory</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/840010-475962_60968_front.jpg</image></root>
