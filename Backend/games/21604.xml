Although on the surface this title seems to largely involve waggling the Wii remote, it does differentiates between horizontal, vertical, and forward movement, which is specifically required to perform certain attacks.There are four different characters you can play as, each with their own playstyle. Saki for instance can sheath her sword and use melee and grapple attacks. Flicking the Wii Nunchuk will also cause her to sprint. Reiko can use a gun, which is controlled using the Wii remote's IR pointer. Although main attacks are performed using motion controls, buttons or dpad are also used for certain attacks. For example, Aya can throw knives using the dpad.Bikini Zombie Slayers also features split screen cooperative play.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13072">Devil May Cry</game><game id="16741">Devil May Cry 2</game><game id="890">Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening</game><game id="6681">Devil May Cry 4</game><game id="6602">Ninja Gaiden Black</game><game id="18546">Ninja Gaiden Sigma</game><game id="20553">Ninja Gaiden II</game><game id="6959">God of War</game><game id="11314">God of War II</game><game id="20592">God of War: Chains of Olympus</game><game id="8720">Dead Rising</game><game id="20690">Left 4 Dead</game><game id="1224">Dynasty Warriors 3</game><game id="10139">Samurai Warriors</game><game id="21348">X-Blades</game><game id="32109">Dragon Sisters</game><game id="35948">Lollipop Chainsaw</game><game id="36707">Devil May Cry HD Collection</game><game id="39749">Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2193297-box_obzs.png</image></root>
