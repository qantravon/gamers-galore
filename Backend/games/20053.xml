<root><id>20053</id><name>Moon Ranger</name><description> Moon Ranger is an unlicensed game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was published by  Bunch Games, a subsidiary of  Color Dreams. When ruthless resource-harvesting aliens land a mining ship on the Moon, the Earth's destruction seems imminent. It is up to the Moon Ranger to combat the invasion force in the depths of space and on their ships.   Moon Ranger is broken up into two gameplay segments: side-scrolling shooter and platformer. Neither part is well-conceived, and the game meets the typically low standard of quality of most Color Dreams titles. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20049">Tagin' Dragon</game><game id="8332">Mission Cobra</game><game id="14143">Castle of Deceit</game><game id="18497">Galactic Crusader</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8230/262571-moon_20ranger.jpg</image></root>
