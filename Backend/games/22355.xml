In Japan the game is known as Wild Speed and was published by Taito Corporation.The Fast and The Furious was designed by Eugene Jarvis who also designed the Cruis'n games, and was the second game released by Jarvis' company Raw Thrills.GameplayThe Fast and The Furious plays very similarly to the Cruis'n series of games also designed by Eugene Jarvis. There are 12 total tracks and 16 cars to choose from. The tracks in the game are all based on real life locations.PIN NumberAfter entering enough credits to play the game, players can enter a pin number using the built in number pad. This PIN number saves the players data, including money earned for another play session. RacesEach race is straight-forward with no short-cuts or alternate paths. Players can step on the gas, release it, and then press it down again rapidly for a small boost and the car will pop the front wheels into the air. When the front wheels are in the air and the player either hits another car or a jump, the car will jump higher in the air and do flips.Cruis'nThe Fast and The Furious was ported in 2007 to the Wii under the name Cruis'n. The game had every instance of The Fast and The Furious license stripped from it and other cosmetic changes were made to have references to Midway.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22354">Cruis'n</game><game id="19022">Cruis'n Exotica</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2549854-fast+and+the+furious.jpg</image></root>
