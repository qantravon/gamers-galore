Originally conceived as a trilogy of games, development of the sequel was shelved for years after the original game failed to sell as well as anticipated by its publisher, Ubisoft. This new entry in the trilogy will be developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and designed by series creator Michel Ancel. The game was announced at Ubidays 2008 on May 29, 2008. According to Ancel, the game was still in the pre-production stage at the time of the announcement. It has been said that the difficulty of the game will go down a notch because Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, doesn't want to repeat the disastrous sales of the first title.Since the initial announcement and release of a reveal trailer in 2008, Ubisoft has shown nothing of the game publicly. Three years after the initial announcement on June 7th, 2011, Ancel made a claim on GameTrailers TV that the publisher is waiting for the next generation of consoles for "the power needed to deliver the experience he wants from the game". He would not comment on whether or not the recently announced Nintendo Wii U had the power he needed when asked.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19467">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/112/207466-beyond_g_and_e_2_teaserscreen_02.jpg</image></root>
