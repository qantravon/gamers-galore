A zone is 20 metres around where the tag was dropped, and other players can see on a map and through the camera where others have claimed a zone. Other players can Tag over someone else's and take that zone after a certain time, which is based on each player's rank in the game.Players gain more art work to tag with by earning "Taggitz," which players receive by tagging zones and taking over others.The beta began on the 20th of November, 2012.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2479374-tag.jpg</image></root>
