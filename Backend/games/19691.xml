Exploring their relative’s attic they discover a treasure map for the island. What follows is their adventuring for treasure on the island.Gameplay Similar to the original Bubble Bobble game mechanics; in Double Shot, you trap enemies in a bubble and then pop it before they can escape. Bub shoots a green bubble, Bob shoots a blue bubble, and Bubu shoots a red bubble. Some enemies can only be trapped by one color bubble, while others can only be trapped by two different bubbles simultaneously. So picking the correct character for each encounter is an important element of the game’s strategy.    There are 100 stages, and every 10 stages you fight a boss character. If the player loses all their lives they must complete a touch screen minigame to continue on. Double Shot supports co-operative multiplayer for multiple DS cards, up to three players.    </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7395">Pokémon Trozei!</game><game id="19154">Pokémon Pinball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2179/1766482-__bubble_bobble_double_shot_ds__.jpg</image></root>
