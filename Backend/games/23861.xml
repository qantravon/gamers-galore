It's primarily text-based, with some top-down exploration. Using dialog trees, the players responses and actions will affect how each girl feels about them. Players will gain and lose hearts depending on their choices, and some options will alter which girl gains and loses hearts. Some choices can also result in Keitaro getting sent home, causing an early game over, or getting smacked and losing health.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/672524-front_cover.jpg</image></root>
