The player must navigate through the levels and use Explodemon's unique ability in order to perform a variety of tasks that will allow him to move onward: destroy enemies and/or objects, throw himself through the air and solving environmental puzzles.  The developers have described the game as: "a loving   parody of badly translated action games and everything that they embody"  Availability The game is available for purchase through the        PlayStation Network.  Comparisons to 'Splosion Man While observers may notice quite a few similarities between the two games; both being puzzle-platformers with an exploding main character,  Explodemon! has actually been in development for years before  'Splosion Man, and coincidentally, both games were      announced on the very same day: April 1st, 2009.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5251">Mega Man</game><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="17452">Alien Hominid</game><game id="22696">The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai</game><game id="20483">Bionic Commando Rearmed</game><game id="11021">Cloning Clyde</game><game id="20743">Metal Slug 7</game><game id="11913">Mega Man Maverick Hunter X</game><game id="7238">Mega Twins</game><game id="20733">Castle Crashers</game><game id="2253">Astro Boy: Omega Factor</game><game id="33981">A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2198059-explodemon.png</image></root>
