When you made your choice you find yourself in a vast (depending the map) world, with the majority of it obscured from view by a fog of war. It is your task to raise cities, recruit new troops and advance your magic research. Meanwhile, you can recruit heroes and send them out to explore the lands, fight myriads of monsters, hunt for treasure and so forth.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16369">Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade</game><game id="9446">Dominions 3: The Awakening</game><game id="21978">Master of Magic</game><game id="24369">Elemental: War of Magic</game><game id="15533">Disciples: Sacred Lands</game><game id="15406">Disciples II: Dark Prophecy</game><game id="21130">Disciples III: Renaissance</game><game id="1915">Heroes of Might and Magic V</game><game id="14391">Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest</game><game id="10692">Heroes of Might and Magic IV</game><game id="12466">Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Succession Wars</game><game id="25912">King's Bounty: Armored Princess</game><game id="22154">King's Bounty: The Legend</game><game id="10935">Darklands</game><game id="35244">Disciples III: Resurrection</game><game id="37248">Warlock: Master of the Arcane</game><game id="5921">M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15405/831605-age_of_wonders___shadow_magic_coverart.jpg</image></root>
