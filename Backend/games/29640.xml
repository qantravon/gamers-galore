Also, depending on the game mode, there is a choice of a 3x3 and a 5x5 playfield. Depending on the color of the panel, the panels are supposed to be lifted to the correct height. Yellow panels stay at the regular height, orange ones one section up, dark green ones two sections up and light green panels three sections up.The three throphies.Depending on how well you do, the game awards you with three kinds of throphies and an expression by Mr. Colpile himself. He is the one that is walking around on the top screen while you solve puzzles on the bottom. If you make too many steps lowering or lifting the panels, Mr. Colpile will just be sitting indifferently. If you manage to stay in the average steps required, he will encourage you by saying „Very Good!“ and if you will do it in the genius step range, he will be amazed and say „Marvelous!“.The game modes featured in Colpile are:Endless – Puzzles are automatically generated.Time Attack – Solve 3 puzzles as quickly as possible.Versus – The objective is to solve puzzles faster than the other player.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/45471/1232440-me0001100782_2.jpg</image></root>
