Even though the game was in 3D, combat is essentially on a 2D-plane with foreground/background sidestepping. Warriors Rage is also where Asura first appeared in the Samurai Shodown franchise. As important as this game is to the storyline, it was never officially released in North America. However, Warriors Rage did get a sprite-based port to the Neo-Geo Pocket Color as Samurai Shodown! 2.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24879">Samurai Shodown 64</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5166/840151-samsho64_2.jpg</image></root>
