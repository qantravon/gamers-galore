During a game, if a piece is captured, a short video plays of the captured character being caught. Because all the pieces have their own animation for capturing all the other pieces (barring the king), there are 140 total animations. Specifically, there are 60 western themed animations, 60 pirate themed, and 20 other animations: one for completing tutorial mode, one as an introductory cartoon, and three each for pirate story mode, western story mode, winning pirate, losing pirate, winning western, and losing western.AwardsEditor's Choice Award, Children's Software Revue (US)Outstanding Award, Educate On-line (UK)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/18175/840376-lego_chess.jpg</image></root>
