Last but not least, you could paint the car in all sorts of colours, although this could be changed later in the game. Afterward, the player could drive around the town and engage in various mini-games which were accessible throughout the town, which would involve the own car, such as racing around tracks or a destruction derby.The game is based on a range of mini toy cars, manufactured by Mattel and the strongest competitor of Matchbox, that is, until the latter was acquired by Tyco.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1166">Badlands</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9470/392381-hotwheels.jpg</image></root>
