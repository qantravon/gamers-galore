It was created in 1999 by Scholastic. The gameplay consists of clicking on certain places to start a photo-hunt. A poem is shown at the bottom of the screen, and a voice will narrate the poem (for children who can't read). Then you must search for the objects and click on them once you have found them. When an object is clicked on, it performs an animation to show it has been found, and a jingle plays. Sometimes you will to click and drag an object to another area. Once you have found all the objects in the poem, one of the objects moves to reveal a piece of a map behind it. You must click on the map piece to continue. The game is based around getting all these pieces and arranging them to create the map which shows where the treasure is hidden. Once you beat the game, it starts over with a second "campaign" where all the pictures are the same but the objects you must find are different. There are three "campaigns" in total.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/49304/1295551-i_spy_treasure_hunt.jpg</image></root>
