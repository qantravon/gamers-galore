When a word is formed, pressing the OK button will submit it and the player will recieve a certain number of points, depending on the length of the word. Making words fills a progress bar at the top of the screen; when it's filled, the next level is unlocked, although the player can stay and solve words on the current puzzle before choosing to move on. However, making a word that uses all available letters in the level will solve a "longest word" and unlock the next level immediately, regardless of the fullness of the progress bar.Twist PuzzleTwist puzzle has only one row instead of the two in Basic. In this mode you will get a series of jumbled letters as before, but you will not get to rearrange them per letter; you will need to tap in between them to swap their positions to make a word, and then submit it. This requires you to arrange words in your head more so than Basic puzzle.AwardsText Twist Puzzle Pro, like many iPhone games, has a set of awards, similar to Xbox 360 Achievements or PS3 Trophies. Awards can be won by reaching certain milestones in either Basic or Twist Puzzle modes, or by solving longest words quickly. These awards appear to have no in-game reward and simply catalogue your accomplishments in the game to show to friends.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13683/952811-text_twist.jpg</image></root>
