Developed during the summer of 1979 while Richard Garriot was a teenager working at ComputerLand in Clear Lake City, Texas. Copies were originally distributed by Garriot in plastic bags, before the rights were bought by California Pacific Computer in 1980. The original name was DD28b, since it was based on Garriot's 28th game inspired by the Dungeons  Dragons ruleset. Since it was written in BASIC for the Apple II, the source code was easily modified by other users and developers to hack their characters. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12657">Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai</game><game id="16408">Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/608559-aklabeth_1_.jpg</image></root>
