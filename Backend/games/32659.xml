Each maze has blocks that can be pushed in order to kill enemies. Additionally, there are several special blocks that the player can stack in a match three style in order to get certain effects. For example stacking 3 dynamite blocks together will kill all of the enemies in the level. The enemies also drop coins and diamonds as loot. In addition to pushing blocks, Kitten Kaboodle is capable of also jumping over or breaking bricks in order to traverse each maze.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="4196">Pengo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1176/1518295-kitten.jpg</image></root>
