The game contains some rudimentary AI of a very simple kind, and the ability to both bat and bowl. The appearance of animated multiple stick men as players must have been notable at the time - it compares favourably to the X and O graphics on Atari's American Football simulator of the time.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3859/912798-1181242105247.png</image></root>
