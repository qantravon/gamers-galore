You control the pandas, because they are cuter. The main objective is to destroy the camps of ninjas in each level. The way you can achieve this is simple: the Big Panda throws small pandas towards the ninjas. You can control the strength and orientation of these shots. You can win a level by clearing it of all ninjas. You get your score based on the number of remaining small pandas, the ninjas and objects you hit and your accuracy.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30199">Angry Birds</game><game id="32943">Angry Birds Seasons</game><game id="37783">Toy Shot</game><game id="40581">Angry Birds Friends</game><game id="38256">Shark Dash</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87771/1662239-pandas_vs_ninjas_android_2.gif</image></root>
