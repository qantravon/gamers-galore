The game is a mission based sandbox game similar to the Grand Theft Auto series, however in this game your car has weapons mounted on it. Another difference was that unlike in GTA you couldn't get out of the car and steal another one anytime you felt like it , you had to stick to your initial vehicle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10616">Streets of SimCity</game><game id="13200">Vigilante 8</game><game id="7468">Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense</game><game id="12318">Twisted Metal</game><game id="16436">Twisted Metal 2</game><game id="4635">Twisted Metal III</game><game id="10173">Twisted Metal 4</game><game id="6426">Twisted Metal: Black</game><game id="31754">Twisted Metal</game><game id="35487">Carmageddon: Reincarnation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1797233-box_roadkill.png</image></root>
