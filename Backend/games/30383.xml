<root><id>30383</id><name>DiRT 3</name><description>OverviewFollowing in the tracks of the critically acclaimed Dirt 2, Dirt 3 is an off-road racing game with a variety of events to complete. There are over hundred events to participate in, and drivers will race in many different environments around the world, including African plains, mountainous Aspen, Monaco and Norway. The player will work as a team with other drivers to win races. Developer Codemasters described it as their "biggest racing game" yet. On the 10th May, the game was submitted to Microsoft and Sony for certification.DevelopmentChangeable weather conditionsThere is a new scoring system in place that takes into account how close the driver comes to various obstacles, similar to the "near miss" bonus in the Burnout franchise. Multiple In-game replays, of 30 seconds in duration, can now be uploaded directly to YouTube (to DiRT3 community channel and the personal channel) to share with others. The graphic engine also got an upgrade with more varied weather effects, better lighting and damage model for the cars. Varying track conditions also make a return featuring rain and snow.The car handling will be more realistic than DiRT 2 as cars will drift differently based on whether they are front/rear/four-wheel drive. The car's weight distribution will affect the amount of traction available in corners. The cars also have independent suspensions that shift its balance and center of gravity while drifting. The Gymkhana cars are setup differently but use the same physics and handling model that the game uses throughout. The damage modeling has been updated to take into account where exactly the car got hit and the handling will change accordingly. The game has a system that allows the player to get punctures. If one drives on, the tyre will eventually shred off the rim.User InterfaceThe developers have moved away from the first-person menus of DiRT 2 to what they only describe as a "more stylized" 3D menu system. The game also shuns its Xtreme elements from DiRT 2 in favor of a more slick and minimalistic presentation. There will be a garage area where one will be able to view the cars. The loading screens will show the car which will be driven.LicensingDiRT 3 is the first game in the series since Colin McRae 2005 to feature the important World Rally Championship license. Along with the more dynamic environment model, it marks a bigger focus on rally. This shift coincides with the series' current figurehead, Ken Block, joining WRC in 2010. Block's famous Gymkhana will also make its first appearance. It's a stunt event, focused on extreme acceleration and executing tight drifts in confined spaces. In addition, DiRT 3 will retain the X-Games license. The game will feature Ken Block, Tanner Foust, Kris Meeke, Liam Doran and Sebastien Ogier.Game ModesThe single player campaign, named DiRT Tour, takes place over 4 seasons. Within each season there are 4 championships with multiple events in different disciplines and challenges that test the players driving skills with races and various gymkhana events.Returning modes from DiRT 2Rally - Standard rally mode, which will carry the WRC branding this time.Rallycross - DiRT's form of a standard race, usually on a closed-looped circuit.Trailblazer - Standard rally format with a twist. All cars are on the track at the same time and the player has no co-driver to help with the turns.Raid - Off-track racing with large all-terrain vehicles.CompoundDiRT's version of the GymkhanaAn open-ended playground to improve one's skills in the new Gymkhana mode. The Multiplayer party modes will be held at this Compound. The obstacle courses are based on Ken Block's Gymkhana videos. The compound is designed after the Battersea Power Station in the UK.
