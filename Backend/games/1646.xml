Specifically, this game covers the first generation of Dragon Ball, where Goku is still a child and the Saiyans have not yet entered the picture. Daimaou Fukkatsu roughly means "Demon King's Revival" and refers to Piccolo, then still the chief antagonist.GameplayThe game is a hybrid adventure/RPG, where Goku must solve various puzzles in order to proceed and also fight foes in an RPG-style combat system. The combat system uses cards to decide attacks; Daimaou Fukkatsu being one of the earliest RPGs to use this system.Cards also factor into the overworld movement too, as Goku moves along a board game-like path and can only travel a set number of squares decided by using one of his cards. Since high-numbered cards are also integral to winning fights, the player must be cautious about moving too quickly across the world lest they run out of powerful cards for the combat.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22891">Godzilla Trading Battle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/558370-dragon_ball_daimaou_fukkatsu_box_front.jpg</image></root>
