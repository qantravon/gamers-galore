In spite of the macabre death that begins the game it is full of Japanese comedic touches, such as absurd non-sequitur mini-games and an instance of perverted humor where the protagonist can search a girl's bedroom and find undergarments.It is also full of unique additions to the genre, presumably suggested by Sanma Akashiya himself in much the same way Beat Takeshi directed some of Takeshi's Challenge's odder design decisions. These include a little crab as a cursor for selecting items to interact with as well as the strange designs for some of the NPCs.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="39246">Loretta no Shouzou</game><game id="40535">Pro Yakyuu?
