The game plays similarly to Yie Ar Kung-Fu and also has similar music and sound effects, but is unrelated to Konami's earlier Arcade classic.The player can select from modes where they simply fight other opponents, or they can select a mode where the RPG aspects kick in and has a story to follow. The player character improves stats by fighting opponents which appear randomly, as with RPGs. The player can also face enemies at the temple, whom get progressively stronger each time one is defeated.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14551">Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi</game><game id="13557">Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/554744-keru_naguru_box.jpg</image></root>
