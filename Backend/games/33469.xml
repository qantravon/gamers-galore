It features several modes: "Bomberman," a traditional single-player Bomberman game, "Panic Bomber," based on the  puzzle game of the same name, "Point and Click," a second puzzle game in which the player clears space by clicking on two adjacent Bomberman heads of the same color, and "Bomberman Park," a collection of mini-games. Bomberman 64 was the last official Nintendo 64 game to be released in Japan, though the     last N64 game worldwide was released more than six months later.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/1662248-bomberman_64_japan.jpg</image></root>
