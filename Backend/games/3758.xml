As Kickle, you'll play through 4 "Lands," each consisting of a set number of stages. At the end of each "Land," Kickle must face, and defeat, a different boss. Each level can be cleared by collecting a red dream bag. Kickle is assisted in his efforts by his ability to breathe on enemies and turn them into an ice cube. He can then kick them into places to create walkways, bridges or shields to protect him from enemies.The game's Japanese name is Meikyūjima (迷宮島?, lit. "Labyrinth Island" or "Maze Island") and the NES version is actually a port of an older Arcade game.This game is very similar toThe Adventures of LoLo.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6430">Adventures of Lolo 2</game><game id="5026">Adventures of Lolo</game><game id="11353">Arkista's Ring</game><game id="1486">Astro Robo Sasa</game><game id="8997">Banana</game><game id="8802">Binary Land</game><game id="40940">Flappy Special</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10500/493393-kickle_art2.jpg</image></root>
