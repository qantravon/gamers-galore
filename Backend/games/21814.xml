<root><id>21814</id><name>Steel Horizon</name><description>Steel Horizon is an alternate WW2 strategy game, published by Konami America and developed by Climax Groups' now-defunct LA studio.Steel Horizon tells the lost tale of a naval Captain during World War II and his fight against the Nazis, the Japanese and the nefarious Babel Syndicate, a shadowy organization attempting to manipulate the war's outcome behind the scenes. Inspired by pulp novels, the Babel Syndicate has access to a variety of "super science" weapons, all fueled by a mysterious element known to the Nazis as "Neoteutonium."After selecting one of three possible flagships to command (battleship, carrier or submarine), the player embarks on the 25-mission campaign. Gameplay is a turn-based affair, in which the player builds units and tactically deploys them to accomplish their various objectives. Unlike most games in the genre, multiple ships can be grouped into a single "square" of the map. Battles, however, are resolved via real-time skirmishes involving multiple ships.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2525251-box_shorizon.png</image></root>
