While on-foot you have an arsenal of about 10 weapons that you collect as you progress through the game. While in a Vehicle you have access to some significantly more powerful weapons that are required to take down some enemies that attack you in vehicles of their own. The vehicle battles play out close to what you might expect out of a       Twisted Metal game, where you can ram people or shoot them to deal damage.    A unique feature of the game was that you didn't carry around an arsenal of different weapons.  Instead you had one rifle that would transform depending on the ammo you were using.System RequirementsCPU: Pentium-200 or equivalent (PII 266 or equivalent recommended)  or AMD K6 2  32MB RAM 300 MB of hard drive space 4x CD-ROM 3D Accelerator card Win 95/98 compatible sound card</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12318">Twisted Metal</game><game id="19869">Necrodome</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48176/1394112-foto_redline.jpg</image></root>
