With tables as diverse as a 45,000 year old prehistoric golf course to the outer regions of space, your pinball wizardry will be put to the test.Critical ReceptionWhen the TG-CD version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,6,5 adding, "...I really like the huge play field. This side-wise scrolling was a rare treat that I hadn;t seen before. There could have been more things to shoot at but what was there was done quite well".</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1731291-time_cruise.jpg</image></root>
