The game is broken up with a large persistent overworld and several smaller dungeons that contain valuables. The player can also enter houses and talk to the NPCs within, answering their questions with the "yes" and "no" prompts, and occasionally trading with them for useful items.Like Cleopatra no Mahou and a few early Famicom RPGs the player can't actually see their own stats beyond their current health and gold totals. Even though better equipment becomes available and makes a demonstrable difference in attack strength and defense, there is no way for the player to view directly how these stats have been affected.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16241">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</game><game id="4208">Ys III: Wanderers from Ys</game><game id="15158">Dragon Slayer</game><game id="12337">Dragon Buster</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2301291-chester_field_box_artwork.jpg</image></root>
