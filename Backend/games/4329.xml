<root><id>4329</id><name>Full Tilt! 2 Pinball</name><description>Full Tilt! 2 Pinball is a pre-rendered 3D pinball game developed and published by Maxis. It was released in 1996 and is, not surprisingly enough, a Windows PC only game and was distributed on CD's.Upon release it was advertised as having "...precisely modeled ball movement, three-way table nudging, realistic sound effects, and fast multi-ball action." and was at the time a solid competitor in the pinball simulator market. It is a direct sequel/successor to Full Tilt! Pinball and shares many similarities with it's predecessor.The game has three tables; Mad Scientist, Alien Daze and Captain Hero. The different tables provided different themes, but all have a common thread in the direction of comic books and sci-fi.The 'successor' to Full Tilt! 2 Pinball is the much more widely known 3D Pinball for Windows which came bundled with many Microsoft products in the late 90's and early 2000's. I say 'successor' because despite originating from the Full Tilt! series, it has fewer features and less impressive graphics as well as only one table.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25477">SlamIt Pinball: Big Score</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2920/1973197-full_tilt_2_pinball_cover.jpg</image></root>
