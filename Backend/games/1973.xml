Battles are turn-based and continue until one side has lost all their HP.Heracles no Eikou has a few minor improvements to the Dragon Quest formula, such as giving shopkeepers portraits or changing Heracles' sprite to reflect armor changes.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/569563-hercules_no_eikou_box_front.jpg</image></root>
