The player can draw a line through at least two adjacent balloons in order to pop them. Once the balloons have been popped the remaining balloons will fall upwards to fill the newly created gaps. More balloons will fill the screen from the bottom, with the object being to remove bubbles so that those that move upwards form groups of three or more of the same color. These will then also be destroyed from the screen, earning the player points.Balloon Pop Remix features a story mode, puzzle mode, endless mode, and multiple mini-games. One such mini-game has players dragging bubbles of different colors into matching containers at the top of the screen. As the timer in this game ticks down, bubbles start appearing in colors that don't match any container, keeping a player on his or her toes. Dragging a bubble to a non-matching container takes away points.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40469">Pop'n Pop</game><game id="40471">Balloon Pop Festival</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2339036-balloon_pop_remix.jpg</image></root>
