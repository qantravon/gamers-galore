<root><id>20877</id><name>The Dog Island</name><description>This exploration game, primarily aimed at children, sees you choose a breed of dog to play and undertake an adventure to the Dog Island to find a herb with which to cure the illness of your brother or sister. Gameplay is primarily quest-based, with a cast of dog characters to help throughout the island, but the game is also open-world once areas have been unlocked within the game. The title is a tie-in to a range of soft toys and other products.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12893">Animal Crossing</game><game id="37136">My Pet Puppy 3D</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5479/309713-the_dog_island_cover.jpg</image></root>
