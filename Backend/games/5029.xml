With the action seen from behind, the ship races over the inhospitable, lava-encrusted planet surface with enemy fighters launching plasma fire at it, all the while avoiding geysers of lava.The object of the game is to set a high score. This is achieved by staying alive as long as possible and taking down enemy fighters. The player spacecraft is protected by an energy shield, which loses power with every hit by an enemy plasma weapon. When the shield energy is depleted, the player ship explodes. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives.Technical SpecificationsXyphr was released for the PC platform (MS-DOS).
