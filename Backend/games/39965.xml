Though most of the game has Kamen Rider Black on foot, there are sequences where he must ride a motorcycle over obstacles before reaching the next boss battle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42249">Ultraman: Kaijuu Teikoku no Gyakushuu</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2340626-krbtsm_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
