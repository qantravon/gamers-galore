<root><id>20644</id><name>Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast</name><description>GameplayOriginally developed for the        Gamecube for use with the       DK Bongos peripheral, production was later moved to the      Wii, where instead of the bongos, you use the     Wii remote and Nunchuck. The Remote acts as the right drum pad and the nunchuck the left, shaking the remote makes    Donkey Kong or one of his friends fly to the right, and the nunchuck makes him or her move to the left.Â   The key to winning involves timing your   boosts when strings of  barrels are ahead. Blasting through a barrel lengthens the duration of the current boost, and if done efficiently, can provide a huge advantage.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15990">Diddy Kong Racing</game><game id="20645">Mario Kart Wii</game><game id="15550">Kirby Air Ride</game><game id="18757">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</game><game id="11656">Rockman Battle &amp; Chase</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2267067-box_dkbb.png</image></root>
