<root><id>42078</id><name>A Game of Thrones - Genesis</name><description>A Game of Thrones: Genesis is a real-time strategy game and acts as a prequel to the novel series A Song of Fire and Ice. During the campaign the player lives through the years -740 to 299.

The player does not build up the settlement, but begins with one - territorial gain is achieved by politics. With the help of ambassadors the player and the AI try to achieve contracts with other cities and rulers. Possible actions include weddings, spying, assassins or secret contract - possibly while another house has an official contract with the partner. However, every action influences the piece meter - when it runs out, war begins. Then the game becomes a traditional real-time strategy game in which units with different advantages and disadvantages fight against each other.</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre><genre>Role-Playing</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9371-1.jpg</image></root>
