Whirlo's own child is endangered, so he leaves to search for a cure to save his son despite the many dangers in- and outside the village.The game is a straightforward platformer with a high-jump mechanic. The player can charge a jump by crouching, allowing Whirlo to jump high distances. Whirlo also has his trusty pitchfork weapon, with which he can perform stabs, downward thrusts and spinning air dash moves - however, all but the basic stab will take Whirlo out of commission for a few seconds before he can recover, thus leaving an opening for enemy retaliation.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34094">Jelly Boy</game><game id="4182">Plok</game><game id="7450">Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2304645-569362_7323_front.jpg</image></root>
