Werner sets out on an adventure, to become a Dragon Knight and avenge his father.GameplayDragon Lore is a    point and click adventure game seen from the    first person perspective, with static backgrounds and a few animated objects (very similar to    Myst). The inventory system and general atmosphere of the whole game feels very much like an RPG, despite the fact that character progression of any kind is almost non-existent. Fighting with enemies depends largely on equipment found and some enemies are not defeated in face to face confrontation, but by solving puzzles.Technical difficultiesIn the time of its release (1994), Dragon Lore was a very problematic title to run. Not mentioning the obvious lack of CD-ROM drives and their high price in this era, those lucky few who had the ability to run CDs on their PC, sometimes had to perform some "magical rituals" on exec and config files before the game even started. Lack of compatability with many sound devices (especially those integrated with motherboards) was also a huge issue.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16507">Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</game><game id="7885">Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny</game><game id="8033">Lands of Lore III</game><game id="17367">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</game><game id="1129">The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</game><game id="17285">Anvil of Dawn</game><game id="7999">Lost Eden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/46/363394-dragonlorefront.jpg</image></root>
