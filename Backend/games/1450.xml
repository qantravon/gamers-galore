A different level design is incorporated into the Mega Drive version, but the general premise is the same.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9183">Jackal</game><game id="21880">Twin Hawk</game><game id="18432">Fire Power</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9238/611119-f2_8.jpg</image></root>
