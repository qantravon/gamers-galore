It is not the same game as the  first DKC as the locales were different that conclude at some factory with a showdown against         King K. Rool. Like the first DKC, you play as        Donkey Kong and       Diddy Kong as you travel through jungles, caves, and more. Most of the same enemies from DKC are in this spin-off even though there are different bosses. The animals are also in this game with      Rambi,     Enguarde, and    Expresso. Due to the Game Boy's limitations, only one character is shown on the character screen compared to two, but you can switch characters by pressing the select button. Its save feature is also different from Donkey Kong Country being that you have to get all four KONG letters to save your game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18676">Sonic Blast</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="9551">Disney's Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3509/698794-donkeykongland_gb_na.jpg</image></root>
