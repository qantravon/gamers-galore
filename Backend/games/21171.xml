It is bundled with wireless motion-sensitive microphones with built in LED lights which change according to the song being played. Lips also enables you to sing from your own music collection from most USB-capable MP3 players.Lips is a standard karaoke game, which tracks your singing pitch and rhythm, following in Sony’s SingStar style. Microsoft and developer iNiS (best known for Elite Beat Agents and the Ouendan series on Nintendo DS) use the master recordings for all of the songs in the game. Many of the songs are backed by the performer’s original music video.Downloadable tracks also are available and most include the original video. The current downloadable list of tracks is below. The downloadable tracks are either 180 or 160 Microsoft Points each. Track-packs of three songs are 440 Microsoft Points.Pre-orders of Lips came with a code to download a new song every week for two months free of charge from the Zune Marketplace. These songs were selected by the Zune team.Freestyle modeYou can play every song you like in Freestyle mode. Using this mode, you can sing along with your own music to gain points.ExpansionsAlthough it might seem like it, there is actually no real sequel to the Lips game. Lips only has expansions which you can buy on a disc, with the option to buy it with or without the two original microphones. You can play the expansions without having to own the original Lips disc, but to achieve an S-rank, you will need the original disc plus all of the expansions. Besides the first Lips, the current expansion packs are:Lips: number one hitsLips: party classicsLips: I love the 80'sWhilst you were able to fill your Star Stream meter by shaking your microphones in the original Lips, this is no longer possible in the expansions. The expansions have a couple of new features that are new:You have to shake your microphone at the right time to follow a rhythm shown on your screenYou get combo points for singing flawless sequences, which can give you a huge score boostYou have to do special moves when a silhouette appears on the screen to gain extra pointsWhen playing an expansion, you can choose if you want to be able to see the other lips songs as well. If you select a song from another Lips "version", you will have to insert the right dic for that song and when you're done singing it you'll have to insert the disc from the version you were playing again.CompatibilityAs of a September 2009 update, Lips' wireless microphone is compatible for use with Rock Band 2 and every younger Rock Band version. The microphones are also compatible with Guitar Hero Metallica and every Guitar Hero (and DJ hero) version released after that.You can also buy a Microsoft microphone similar to the Lips microphone and with the same compatibility separately.Song ListThe song list for Lips includes:"Take on Me" by a-ha"No One" by Alicia Keys"Potential Break Up Song" by Aly  AJ"Complicated" by Avril Lavigne"Stand by Me" by Ben E.
