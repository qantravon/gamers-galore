This time, however, instead of using perspective and camera  manipulation, the game uses colors and time manipulation to engage the  player. Gameplay echoshift is slated to debut with  roughly 45 levels spread over 9 differently themed worlds. There are  expected to be about 30 different types of puzzles, revolving around the  concepts of color coding and time manipulation. From gameplay videos  released at E3 2009, the time mechanic appears to only work in one  direction; you play a level up to a certain point, and then trigger a  replay up to that point. There is currently no indication that time will  run backwards, or change behavior in different levels. Extras It  has been stated that there will be extra levels made available to  download through the PSN.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="8669">Exit</game><game id="23189">Exit 2</game><game id="1710">Mercury Meltdown</game><game id="6382">Archer Maclean's Mercury</game><game id="18285">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14741/1240047-es.jpg</image></root>
