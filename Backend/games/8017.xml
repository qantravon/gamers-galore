Fidel Castro's heirs were unable to keep the revolutionary flame burning, and a surprise uprising has toppled the Communist regime. In it's wake, a fragile hope for democracy emerges. The interim President, Pedro Ebana, promises free elections, and requests international aide to safeguard said elections. For there are those in Cuba who still do not want a democratic regime, and they will do anything it takes - subversion, violence or open revolution - to make certain that Cuba's future is one that they will make for themselves.From the midst of chaos, comes the call for the Ghosts. Their mission: to ensure the integrity of the new Democratic Cuban elections and to thwart any attempts made to subvert them. As a violent revolution funded with drug money brews in the Western Provinces, it becomes clear that this will be the most dangerous mission the Ghosts have ever faced.OverviewTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder is an expansion for the original Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.
