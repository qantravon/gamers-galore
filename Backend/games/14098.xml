Owners of the previous game, Apache vs Havoc, can import the helicopters and scenarios into the updated engine, allowing you to pilot 4 helicopters throughout all six dynamic war scenarios.The game is fully multiplayer compatible with the previous game, whether or not all players own all the games.On February 10, 2003 Razorworks released the game's source code (game assets not included), and the mod community got started with enhancing the game engine, adding dynamic, reflective water, higher texture resolutions, better Track IR support and the ability to go through the start-up procedure manually. By the latest community release in 2011, more than 10 additional scenarios have been added to the game, and two additional helicopters have been made available to fly - the AH1Z Viper and Mil Mi-24 Hind. Many of the community improvements made it's way into the 2007 sequel Enemy Engaged 2, which largely reuses the assets and scenarios from the combined Apache vs Havoc and Comanche vs Hokum tandem games, and was developed and published by G2 Games rather than Razorworks.In 2009 both Comanche vs Hokum and Apache vs Havoc were released on GOG.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23043">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark</game><game id="37289">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark 2</game><game id="18759">Comanche 4</game><game id="3172">Gunship!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/44753/1442800-eech.jpg</image></root>
