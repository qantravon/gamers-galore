In several game modes players must first identify themselves on the screen running around in a lot of moving NPCs and then complete a specific goal, e.g. killing the other player, touching five objects or killing a specific NPC. In another mode one player plays as a sniper while up to three other players try to murder NPCs while hiding between them by acting like them. In a racing mode the sniper just one bullet and has to find the PC before he crosses the finish line.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/148570/2216408-398px_lynx_lynx2.jpg</image></root>
