Like Behave, Welcome to My Underground Lair attempts to be an operating system with an evil spin. The game comes with a calculator, a Pac-man clone , a 2D driving game, and a lot of other computer-related applications. The game goes very far to convince you that it is running something like Windows, even making you shutdown the game like a computer and starting up with an unavoidable DOS-like cutscene.FeaturesMojo MazeDomination'Kin' EvilRock Paper ScissorsAbility to change cursor, backgrounds, screensaverCustomizable sound effects"Internet" with information about Austin PowersFrickulator (Calculator)Movie Clip utilizing only blue/black colors from the moviesQuotes from the game"You did not shutdown the Game Boy properly.
