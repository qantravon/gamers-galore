As Link, the player must travel a vast ocean to find his sister. A full-on HD remaster of The Wind Waker for the Wii U is scheduled to arrive in October 2013.SettingThis game takes place entirely on an ocean overworld.The Wind Waker begins in a small island on the corner of a vast ocean, where all boys of Outset Island wear the familiar green tunic when they come of age.The Wind Waker is set on The Great Sea, a vast ocean with many small landmasses scattered throughout, but with no large continents.StoryLink's sister, Aryll, has been kidnapped....The game begins on Outset Island, Link's home. Whilst looking through the telescope given to him by his younger sister, Aryll, he spots a pirate ship approaching the island.The ship is following a huge black bird with a girl in its claws. The bird drops the girl into a thick forest atop Outset Island. Link finds a sword and enters the forest in search for the girl. After rescuing her, the pirates from the ship come to find her.It turns out her name is Tetra, the captain of the pirate ship. As they exit the woods, Link's sister is outside looking for him. After a moment of waving and smiling, the bird returns, but this time attacks Aryll. The bird flies away with her and Link sets off on the pirate ship to rescue her.....she is tracked down to a Forsaken Fortress....They hear rumors that the bird nests in a place called 'The Forsaken Fortress' in the North. They head there and send Link to find Aryll. However, Link is so excited when he is re-united with his sister that the bird notices him. The bird takes him to its master, a mysterious dark-caped figure with orange flame-like hair. The bird throws Link into The Great Sea and Link wakes up on Windfall island. He finds a talking red boat called The King of Red Lions.....the rescue attempt fails...He asks Link to locate him a sail so that they can travel across the sea in search for Aryll. After a sail has been acquired, the pair head for Dragon Roost Island to locate Din's Pearl, a magical orb containing the powers of the goddess, Din. They are told by the native tribe, the Ritos that they may have whatever they wish if they find out what is troubling the giant dragon, Valoo, who resides atop their island. After link travels through the following dungeon and defeats the creature that is causing Valoo to attack anyone who approaches him. As thanks, they present Link with the pearl....Link meets a talking boat who seems to know him....Behind the island, there is a pair of monuments to the wind gods. The King of Red Lions gives Link the fabled Wind Waker, a magical conductorâ€™s baton with the power to control the wind. One of the wind gods teaches Link how to use the baton to change the direction of the wind, allowing Link to travel to new islands. The god also mentions how his brother is angry and is creating huge cyclones on the Great Sea.Link heads to the Forest Haven where the second pearl, Farore's pearl, is located. Link requests the pearl from the Deku Tree. The tree is about to bestow it upon him when the Koroks, a race of tree-like creatures appear. They are unsettled and say that their fellow Korok, Makar, is missing. He entered the Forbidden Woods next to the Forest Haven and did not return. Link goes to find him and after this second dungeon, the Tree rewards Link with the pearl....an unpleasant history is revealed....Link heads towards Greatfish Isle, where the third and final pearl, Nayru's pearl, is said to be located. When they arrive the island has been torn apart and the Great Fish spirit, Jabun is nowhere to be seen. The Rito tribe postman arrives and tells Link that Ganondorf, the dark figure from the Forsaken Fortress, attacked the island in search for the pearl. Link returns to Windfall Island and discovers that the pirate's ship is docked behind a cliff. Link searches around for the Pirates and finally finds them in the bomb shop.He enters stealthily from the back entrance and overhears that they are stealing the bombs from the shop to use them to break into a cave at the rear of Outset Island, as this is where a 'great treasure' is located. This treasure is in reality the final pearl. Tetra notices Link and tells the Pirates that they will delay the journey until morning because she realizes that Link wants to find the treasure, for some reason. Link reaches the cave and Jabun presents him with the pearl.Link places the pearls in their monuments and they connect with each other with beams of light, that when viewed from above, resembles the legendary Triforce. In the center of the monuments, a huge tower emerges in the middle of the sea. The King of Red Lions tells Link that this is called the Tower of the Gods and that he must complete the trials within to earn the trust of the Gods....a long lost kingdom is found....After he defeats the creature created by the Gods, they open up a portal to the legendary kingdom of Hyrule. They arrive outside Hyrule Castle and Link enters, only to find the interior filled with evil creatures, frozen in time. Link enters an area beneath the castle and finds a mysterious sword in a pedestal. He removes the blade and all of the creatures return to life. After Link uses the sword to defeat the creatures, he heads out of the Castle. He finds that there is a magical barrier preventing his access to the rest of Hyrule.Link returns to The King of Red Lions and the pair return to the surface above, as Hyrule has been sealed below the sea. The King of Red Lions informs Link that the sword is the famed 'Master Sword' and it has to power to defeat Ganondorf. They return to the Forsaken Fortress with the 'blade of evil's bane' and attempt to rescue Aryll again. The Pirates arrive as Link finds his sister and they take Aryll with them so that Link can continue towards Ganondorf. The huge bird returns, but this time, Link fights it and manages to defeat it. Link meets face to face with Ganondorf, who informs Link that the sword has lost its old powers....its heirs unveiled....Tetra shows up to assist Link and Ganondorf, and the sorcerer says that the three have assembled at last. Before they can question him, Valoo and Prince Komali show up and attack Ganondorf. Link, The King of Red Lions and Tetra return to Hyrule to hide Tetra from Ganon. Before Tetra can ask why, they find a man where the Master Sword was. He tells them that he is the King of Hyrule, and that it is he who was speaking through The King of Red Lions. He tells Tetra to get out her golden necklace and he inserts a piece into it. It turns out that it is the Triforce of Wisdom and that she is, in fact the ancestor to Princess Zelda.She uncharacteristically submissively assumes her new identity of Princess Zelda as she is infused with the Triforce. She remains in the Castle to protect herself from Ganon's clutches. The King tells Link that they must find the two ancient sages to restore the powers to destroy evil to the Master Sword.....a great adventure reborn....The sages of the Wind and Earth Temples have been killed by Ganondorf to prevent the sword being revived. The spirits of the Sages tell Link that they must find their ancestors and return to the Temples to restore power to the sword. The Sages turn out to be the Korok, Makar and the Rito apprentice, Medli. After they restore the power to the Master Sword by clearing the evil creatures from the Temples, Link must assemble the eight pieces of the Hero's Triforce piece of Courage.The Triforce of Courage was split into eight pieces when the Hero of Time left Hyrule. Link eventually constructs the Triforce and travels to Hyrule again. Link approaches the barrier that was around the Castle and shatters it with the newly restored Master Sword. He enters Ganondorf's Castle and works his way to find Ganondorf....the fight for the history of Hyrule....Ganondorf has found Zelda and has stolen her Triforce of Wisdom, adding it to his Triforce of Power. Ganondorf summons Puppet Ganon, which attacks Link. Although Link defeats it, Ganondorf escapes with Zelda and Link follows them. Ganondorf reveals to Link that it was not he who destroyed Hyrule but the Gods, who flooded the kingdom when it appeared that Ganondorf was going to win, creating the Great Sea. A few Hylians were taken from their families and sent to the mountaintops; these formed the islands that the people of the Sea live on now. Ganondorf attacks Link in an attempt to take the final Triforce piece by force so that he can form the Triforce and restore Hyrule to its former glory, finally granting his wish for ultimate power in the process....lost.Ganondorf attacks Link and takes the Triforce piece. Just before he touches the Triforce, though the King of Hyrule appears and touches it first. Not caring about the cost to the kingdom he swore to protect, he selfishly wishes that Hyrule is sealed away forever. The walls of water around them begin to crash in and Ganondorf attacks Link and Zelda, intending to kill them before he is returned to his prison. They engage in a short, but epic battle, and eventually Link stabs Ganondorf through the head with the Master sword. Ganondorf is encased in stone and the walls of water begin to crash down faster. The King of Hyrule tells Link and Zelda that he will not return to their world with them, he will stay behind and die with his Kingdom.The walls cave in and Hyrule is completely submerged at last.Link and Zelda wake floating on the sea. The pirate's ship and many other friends from the adventure are there to greet them. Link returns to Outset Island with Aryll and everything is back to normal. The Pirates and Link in his now un-talking boat set off to find new adventures.Link and Zelda would eventually find a new land to call Hyrule which is seen in Spirit Tracks.GameplayControlsLink holds a pig above his headControlling Link is very much similar to the previous 3D entries in the Zelda series. He runs how you would expect, jumps automatically from ledges, and even the Z-targeting feature is retained - now mapped to the left shoulder button. However, he has a few new moves in his repertoire, such as the ability to crawl freely, parry, and counter-attack foes, but he can also learn additional sword tricks throughout his adventure. Wind Waker also featured music within combat which strung in tune with your various attacks.Controls are tight and it is not at all different in any major way to the previous titles on the Nintendo 64, so all those fans would feel right at home with the control scheme. The B button is used to attack, and used to roll and climb up objects, C buttons are to change the camera angles and to enable free look and the other buttons are for equipping items for use for example the Wind Waker and boomerang.SailingWith Hyrule flooded, getting around isn't quite so easy for Link. Early on in the game you'll encounter the King of Red Lions - a charismatic boat, and once you find a sail you'll be ready to sail the seas. The Wind Waker baton can be used to set the direction of the wind to help guide your sails smoothly.DungeonsDragon Roost IslandDragon RoostThe first dungeon in the The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which is located within Dragon Roost Mountain. This is home to the sky spirit Valoo and a race of the bird like people Rito. Valoo is upset and will not allow the Rito to collect his scales, which they need to fly.

The Great Deku Tree promises Link the pearl, once the annual Korok Ceremony has taken place. Unfortunately a Korok named Makar, fell into the woods, when flying over it, postponing the ceremony. The Great Deku Tree sees Link's arrival as fate, and sends Link to the Forbidden woods to save Makar.The Great Deku Tree gives Link a Deku Leaf, which allows Link to fly to the entrance of the Forbidden Woods.

Also, all Hylian text now appears in the player-determined game language.Gameplay-wise, the location of sunken treasure found via treasure maps are changed to be farther away from the islands, making figuring out where they are based on the shape of the islands more difficult.Visual StyleAlthough praised today, it was met with strong hate when first shown.At Nintendo's Space World event in 2000, Nintendo revealed the Gamecube along with a technical demo showcasing a duel between a realistic looking Link and Ganon. A year later at Space World 2001, Nintendo unveiled The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. This new title employed a cel-shaded art style - a departure from the more realistic look of previous Zelda entries and the demo shown the previous year - and gave the game a distinct look that can be likened to cartoons and anime. This caused much controversy among many, splitting the fanbase, some viewing it as childish, whilst others appreciated it as a fresh take on the series.The fan reaction after the debut trailer confused series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. While the game was bashed for its style, it set records with its high rate of pre-orders. The game also became a highly acclaimed title, getting an average of 95% on Gamerankings.com. It's graphics went on to be one of its most praised aspects.Other Info1 PlayerMemory blocks needed: 12Game Boy Advance CompatibleProgressive Scan compatible (480p) (NTSC-only)Dolby Surround Pro Logic IISoundtrackSoundtrack Cover ArtA double disc soundtrack CD was released on March 13th in Japan only.
