<root><id>39878</id><name>Kamen Rider Club: Gekitotsu Shocker Land</name><description>OverviewBased on the Kamen Rider tokusatsu anime and manga, Kamen Rider Club has the player control one of three masked heroes as they fight their way across this 2D side-scrolling platformer.It is yet another NES video game based on an anime license from Bandai, who used the then-recent 1987 Japanese TV series Kamen Rider Black to cash in on the name recognition.GameplayThe game is largely a 2D platformer that scrolls from left to right, though there's optional underworld levels that can be found by falling down holes or lakes. The player character can only attack by punching downwards, requiring that the player be in the air directly above enemies to attack them.Should the player character collide with an enemy without hitting them, the screen changes to that of what appears to be an RPG, as the player and enemy's stats are displayed at the bottom of the screen. The goal of these sections is to alternately tap the two buttons in order to build a power gauge and then keep it powered-up with judicial tapping in order to force the opponent against the opposite wall, which kills them. The game then returns to the 2D platformer level, sans the enemy the player collided with.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2335921-kamen_rider_club_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
