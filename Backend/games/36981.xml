Crackin' DJ tries to mimic the real life DJ-ing experience by having the player cut back and forth between two songs. The cabinet itself is well made with a quality sound system, elaborate lighting set-up, professional grade cross-fader and turntable that rotates during game-play. While the game was not a huge success when it was released, it has a strong cult following.Soundtrack1. Advertise2. Code Number 0033. Chocolate4. Hangover5. Glamorous Fingers6. Nightmare7.
