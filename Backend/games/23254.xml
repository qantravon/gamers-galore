The player is cast in the role of a draftee named Private Nathanial "Nate" Walker. The player will move through a set of linear environments including the jungle, a run-down mansion, Viet-Cong tunnel systems, trenches, and villages.   StoryAt the peak of the Vietnam War, a covert ops plane is transporting a top secret consignment known only as "Whiteknight". It mysteriously goes down over the jungles of Cambodia. A Special Ops team is sent out immediately to search and find "Whiteknight". Slowly, one-by-one they disappear, in the jungles, without a trace. One month later, one of the members of the Ops team stumbles out of the jungles alive. He is deranged, confused and mad. You are sent to the quarantine zone where they are holding the Ops member to try to get some information about "Whiteknight." As the game progresses, you learn why you were sent to question the Operative, why the Viet-Cong want to take you alive, and what "Whiteknight" is.  GameplayCombatCombat is very similar to other first-person shooters. The player can carry flares, frag grenades, a knife, a pistol and a rifle or shotgun. Ammunition is comparatively scarce in this game however, so calm, accurate fire using the iron-sights is needed to ensure that the player will have enough ammunition.  During certain moments, a "grapple attack" may occur. Players are required to hit the buttons in the order they appear to defend himself. If the player is successful, he is given the choice to execute his attacker one of two ways - either with the butt of, or a single shot from, his weapon.  Traps are present in a few areas as well. These include a horizontally-swinging bamboo traps, spiky logs that swing down from the treetops and spiked pits. If a trap is triggered, time slows and the player is given an opportunity to save himself by pressing the button that flashes on the screen.  Heads-Up DisplayThe heads-up display is contextual in that it is not shown unless the player is doing something. For example, reloading briefly shows how much ammunition the player has left, and looking at a a weapon on the ground prompts the player to swap his current gun or pick up ammunition if he is carrying that type of weapon already. Instead, the player's state is reflected in other visual and audio cues. For example, blood on the screen indicates damage, and stamina is reflected by how heavy Nate is breathing. This is an attempt by the developer to increase immersion. AtmosphereAs with many survival-horror games, immersion is an important part of Shellshock 2. In addition to the previously-mentioned HUD, lighting effects and sound design are utilized in an attempt to heighten tension. Critical Reception Shellshock 2: Blood Trails received mid to low reviews. Comments range from "boring" and "uninspired" to "dreadful" and "disaster." The main issues cited by critics include the imprecision of the control scheme, bad AI, and bad level design.  PC System Requirements Operating System: Windows Vista® / XPProcessor: Dual Core processor recommended 3GHz or higher single core processorRAM Memory: 1GB RAM (XP) / 2GB RAM (Vista)Graphics Card: 256MB with Pixel Shader model 3  (GeForce 7600 , ATI Radeon 1800 )DirectX Version: 9.0c (works on 10 but not specifically supported)Hard Drive Space: 8 GBSound Card: Dolby 2.1, compatible with DirectX 9.0c</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13142">Prisoner of War</game><game id="12815">Conflict: Vietnam</game><game id="23831">Tunnel Rats</game><game id="17429">Vietcong: Purple Haze</game><game id="9313">Men of Valor</game><game id="17723">Vietcong</game><game id="5083">Vietcong: Fist Alpha</game><game id="16586">Battlefield Vietnam</game><game id="4598">Wings Over Vietnam</game><game id="20777">Call of Duty: World at War</game><game id="4800">F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon</game><game id="20663">F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</game><game id="504">Platoon</game><game id="20465">Condemned 2: Bloodshot</game><game id="8804">Condemned: Criminal Origins</game><game id="10461">Clive Barker's Jericho</game><game id="10157">Clive Barker's Undying</game><game id="26423">Call of Duty: Black Ops</game><game id="21119">Wolfenstein</game><game id="526">NAM</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png</image></root>
