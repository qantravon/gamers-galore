It was released in 1993 by    Epic Megagames.  The game consisted of three episodes. The first episode was released as shareware with the other two episodes needing to be purchased.   The game was about an ordinary man, heavily implied to be Ken Silverman himself, who wakes up one night to discover his dog being kidnapped by aliens. He tags along on their ship and ends up on their homeworld, where he must defeat the murderous creatures and rescue his beloved pet.   Ken's Labyrinth was later released as freeware on November 16th, 1999. Since then it has been modded and ported to other platforms by the fan community. A port called  "LAB3D/SDL" was created by Jan Lönnberg which allows the game to be played on modern Windows and Linux systems.  Also, a modified version of this port, including high resolution textures was created by Jared Stafford.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7694">Wolfenstein 3D</game><game id="1505">Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold</game><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="621">Doom II: Hell on Earth</game><game id="22548">Hexen</game><game id="7364">Blake Stone: Planet Strike</game><game id="32989">Serious Sam Advance</game><game id="21358">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7001/285310-ken_003.png</image></root>
