Drash</name><description>Very much the black sheep of the Ultima family, this game was produced without any input at all from the series creator Richard Garriott. The game was created by Keith Zabalaoui, a friend of Garriott's who wrote the game for Sierra On-Line. The original Ultima games had been a great success, and the name Ultima was added to this title as an attempt to drive sales. Contrary to rumors, Garriott was fully aware of the game and consented to the use of the Ultima name to help out Zabalaoui, whose game would not otherwise have been published by Sierra.The game's plot and themes are largely unconnected from those of the main series, except for the name "Mt. Drash" itself, which was a location in Ultima I.The game was released for the Commodore VIC-20 only, and the game had a very small production run. Surviving copies are now very rare, which makes the game highly sought after by games collectors - so if you have a copy of this gathering dust in your loft...AvailabilityA 2003 fan remake of the game and its documentation are available at Dino's Ultima Page.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/1347905-ultima_3_drash_a.jpg</image></root>
