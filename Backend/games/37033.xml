The goal of each level is to destroy at least 90% of the given object, with 100% giving a perfect 3 out of 3 star rating for the level. It is possible to swap which bombs are currently being launched with the next one in the inventory. Extra bombs can be added to the inventory if they are freed from a power-up drop located on the board.It's possible to go back to any unlocked level and improve the score.GameplayTypes of BombsSpike Bomb – basic bomb, point and shoot.Ghost Bomb – goes through the ice and is able to be steered by rubbing.Helicopter Bomb – tap to drop up to 3 purple crystals.Split Bomb – tap and it splits into 3 separate green crystals.These bombs are shot by a slingshot like mechanism at the bottom of the screen. Some bombs require additional screen presses after the bomb is launched. For bombs that drop multiple crystals each piece is independent, unless within a certain range of other bomb crystals. Each of them then need to be detonated by an explosion caused by another bomb (typically a Spike Bomb). Using the multiple crystals, and linking them into a chain reaction is an efficient way to clear the board and gives a bonus score multiplier.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30199">Angry Birds</game><game id="34035">Angry Birds Rio</game><game id="32943">Angry Birds Seasons</game><game id="33909">Trucks and Skulls</game><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="14228">Bust-A-Move</game><game id="40581">Angry Birds Friends</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/35153/2080204-img_1902.png</image></root>
