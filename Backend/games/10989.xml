Each team can have up to four characters, however the life bar of each individual fighter is shortened as more people are added to the team.Character Roster                            Ace Blanka Chun-Li                          Cracker Jack Dhalsim Doctrine Dark                            Guile                   Hokuto Ken             Nanase                Ryu                  Sakura                      Sharon                     Skullomania Vega                       Zangief Unlockable Characters          Area         Darun Mister       Garuda       Kairi      M.
