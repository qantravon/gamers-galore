Baseball features a license from the Major League Baseball Players' Association, allowing it to have real baseball players on the roster. However, due to a lack of the core MLB license, the game doesn't contain real teams, referring to all of them by city name only.  Despite having actual MLB players' names (although sometimes truncated), each character looked exactly the same (e.g., there weren't any black players, everyone was the same height, etc.).  The only visual differences among the players was whether they were right- or left-handed, and if pitchers threw overhand or submarine-style. Performance characteristics among the players were present however, with batting average, power, and even running speed distinctions between individual players being reflected in the game.</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5992">Major League Baseball</game><game id="5259">Super Baseball 2020</game><game id="16888">Championship Baseball</game><game id="11284">Konami's Baseball</game><game id="6751">Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball</game><game id="16272">Tecmo Baseball</game><game id="23470">Home Run King</game><game id="40067">Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium</game><game id="40362">Nekyuu Koushien</game><game id="40517">Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data</game><game id="40527">Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88</game><game id="40597">Ganbare Pennant Race!</game><game id="40929">Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium III</game><game id="41423">Shin Moero!!
