The first half of the game primarily deals with standard police activity, like hostage negotiation and traffic stops. Following proper police conduct will reward points, and will make it more likely that Jake Ryan will live through the encounter. The game's second half is a more traditional point-and-click game with Jake tracking down a drug smuggling operation on his own time.The game's concept was written by Jim Walls; a retired police officer who worked with Ken Williams on Police Quest, the Sierra On-Line adventure.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2912">Police Quest 2: The Vengeance</game><game id="12901">Daryl F.
