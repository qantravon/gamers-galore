<root><id>15107</id><name>Arkanoid</name><description>OverviewIn this game the player controls a paddle-like shuttle at the bottom of the screen called the Vaus. The Vaus is used to launch a ball at the bricks above and they explode upon contact with this ball. The goal is to clear all the breakable blocks on screen and then proceed to the next level.Some blocks drop power ups when exploded. Examples of these power ups include slowing down the ball, multiplying the ball by three, giving the Vaus lasers which can be used to break blocks, causing the ball to stick to Vaus allowing the player to strategically re-launch it elsewhere and making Vaus larger.Arkanoid was eventually followed by a sequel, Arkanoid: Revenge of DOH, as well as spawning numerous imitations and reboots. MusicThe music on the Commodore 64 version of the game, composed by Martin Galway, is the first published game tune on the platform to include sampled sounds (used for the drums).Galway took the piece that he had created the previous year for the Sinclair Spectrum game Cobra and adapted it for use on the C64.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4381">Alleyway</game><game id="21712">Ricochet Infinity</game><game id="21805">Touhou 01 - Highly Responsive to Prayers</game><game id="22352">Reaxxion</game><game id="23653">Space Out</game><game id="1089">Amiganoid</game><game id="24756">The Block Kuzushi Hyper</game><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="1055">Super Breakout</game><game id="838">Breakout 2000</game><game id="22819">iBreakout</game><game id="14124">Break 'em All</game><game id="2378">Bachelor Party</game><game id="25054">Bit.Trip Beat</game><game id="19344">Kirby's Block Ball</game><game id="13779">Krakout</game><game id="26185">bricks4ever</game><game id="27262">GloBall</game><game id="26465">Shatter</game><game id="27550">Act Out</game><game id="16576">Amegas</game><game id="27551">Quester</game><game id="818">Alienoid</game><game id="1891">Arcanoid</game><game id="11179">Tetroid 2012</game><game id="27688">Illusion</game><game id="843">Krypton Egg</game><game id="23747">Peggle Nights</game><game id="29660">Trajectile</game><game id="30059">Hyperballoid HD</game><game id="26724">Space Ark</game><game id="27971">Gem Smashers</game><game id="30765">AlphaBounce</game><game id="12116">Barkanoid 3 Gold</game><game id="16818">Barkanoid 2</game><game id="9327">Thunder &amp; Lightning</game><game id="27684">Aquanoid 2</game><game id="31263">Aquanoid GOLD</game><game id="31397">Barkanoid</game><game id="31502">Galaxi Barkonid</game><game id="31510">Aquanoid 3 - 3D</game><game id="31590">Break it 1</game><game id="31591">Break It 3</game><game id="31592">Barkanoid</game><game id="31593">Barkanoid 3</game><game id="8913">Popcorn</game><game id="34065">Paddle Baddle</game><game id="35673">Bit.Trip Complete</game><game id="372">Aquanoid</game><game id="36487">Ricochet HD</game><game id="35666">Wizorb</game><game id="36864">Dragon Dance</game><game id="37540">Zig Zag Cat</game><game id="32436">3D Brick Breaker Revolution</game><game id="36493">Hello Kitty to Issho: Block Crash V</game><game id="39307">Takahashi Meijin no Bugutte Honey</game><game id="2">Breakfree</game><game id="15045">Woody Pop</game><game id="34666">Jongbou</game><game id="39600">Simple 1500 Series Hello Kitty Vol. 03: Hello Kitty Block Kuzushi</game><game id="21953">Ricochet Lost Worlds: Recharged</game><game id="40115">Brick Zone</game><game id="40119">Vs Block Breaker</game><game id="40244">Breakout: Boost</game><game id="21976">Jirbo Break</game><game id="30668">Brickyard/Clowns</game><game id="10304">Construction Bob</game><game id="19253">Bananoid</game><game id="43449">Hello Kitty to Issho!
