<root><id>35123</id><name>Fortix 2</name><description>OverviewFortix 2 is a sequel to the original Fortix released in 2010 by developer Nemesys Games.Both games use core mechanics from the 1981 arcade game Qix as their foundation. Instead of a pixelated diamond as your avatar, this time you navigate the stationary playing field as a 2D sprite named Sir Fortix.Sir Fortix begins every level on the edge the screen and every time he moves a line is drawn in his wake. Once he moves in a complete rectangle that area of the game screen becomes fenced off (conquered).You complete each level by capturing specific objectives on the playing field while dodging flying dragons, turrets and other obstacles which are introduced gradually. Your nemesis throughout the game is the evil mage Xitrof -- also from the original 2010 game Fortix.There are currently 30 levels in the game, each with four difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard and impossible). According to the developers there will be monthly updates as well as DLC.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP SP3 / Vista / 7Processor: 1.5Ghz or fasterMemory: 512MbHard Disk Space: 300MbVideo Card: DirectX 9.0c Compatible video card with minimum 128Mb memory with Pixel Shader 2.0 and Vertex Shader 2.0 supportDirectXÂ®: 9.0cSound: DirectX 9.0c Compatible sound cardMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: Intel Core DuoMemory: 512 MBGraphics: 128 MBHard Drive: 400 MB</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33329">Anomaly: Warzone Earth</game><game id="6136">QIX</game><game id="30120">Cubixx</game><game id="38476">Urbanix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/1776527-header_292x136.jpg</image></root>
