Real Racing was released to worldwide critical praise, and a laundry list of awards and accomplishments. To this day, Real Racing remains the closest game on the iDevices to a racing simulator.  On April 1st, Real Racing HD was released as a   launch title for the  iPad with higher resolution graphics.  On September 9th, Firemint updated Real Racing to include Game Center support. However, that only included Achievements and Leaderboard support, and did not feature online multiplayer, one of Game Centers largest features.   Currently, the only multiplayer is via local wi-fi, or leaderboards, but an multiplayer-update has been submitted to Apple for approval.   No Game Center multiplayer in Real Racing, yet.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30689">Asphalt 5</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6347/1226061-img_0895.png</image></root>
