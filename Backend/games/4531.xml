Super Skidmarks was one of the Amiga's better top down racers that offered a variety of gameplay options. The player had a choice of 24 tracks to race on, and car choice ranges from F1 cars to motorized cows.Motor-Cow Caravan towing actionSuper Skidmarks was also a landmark racing game as it was the first to offer caravan towing as an option while racing. Although this was just a novelty feature, a lot of hardcore multiplayer users managed to master the art of using the caravan to push other players wide on turns.Tracks could also be raced in reverse, which was possibly a genre first at the time. Tracks consisted of sweeping banked curves with jumps and track crossings that led to potential crashes. However, the game did not feature a damage model.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18409">ATR: All Terrain Racing</game><game id="20350">Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament</game><game id="32330">TNT Racers</game><game id="9509">Ivan "Iron Man" Stewart's Super Off Road</game><game id="23897">Supercars II</game><game id="4339">Slicks 'n' Slide</game><game id="29358">Slicks</game><game id="13854">BMX Simulator</game><game id="2776">Super Sprint</game><game id="1166">Badlands</game><game id="26243">Little Racers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2374599-genesis_superskidmarks_gb.jpg</image></root>
