<root><id>35400</id><name>Chaos Rings Omega</name><description>OverviewA very similar game to the original Chaos Rings, with near identical gameplay, and a similar paced story. The game is much like the previous game, with reuse of assets, the same premise, which develops in a different way through the course of the game.The gameplay is built upon Chaos Rings's, being almost identical with its difference being the inclusion of the option to enter a fight, which triggers immediately a fight within the locale the character is in, and the option to avoid fights, that has the opposite effect, disabling random encounters. These options are activated or deactivated by two button on the top of the screen.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38627">Final Fantasy Dimensions</game><game id="13053">Final Fantasy VII</game><game id="11237">Final Fantasy X</game><game id="12277">Final Fantasy VIII</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1665/1787120-chaosringsomegalogo.png</image></root>
