Released in 2005, the game was developed by      Intelligent Systems and published by     Nintendo. Unlike many other GBA games, Dr. Mario  Puzzle League has a demo version that can be downloaded to another GBA. The demo version for Puzzle League is identical to that seen in    Nintendo Puzzle Collection, while the demo version for Dr. Mario has   NES sound and less animations.Gameplay   This version of Puzzle League is different from all previous versions.  Both games included on the cartridge are block-based puzzle games. The version of Dr. Mario is most similar to  Dr. Mario 64. As colored pills fall onto the screen, they must be matched with germs of the same color (as well as other pills). Four germs and pills of the same color in a row eliminate those four. Puzzle League is a completely different version from all other versions released. It is most similar to the version that can be downloaded to the GBA with Nintendo Puzzle Collection. In Puzzle League, blocks are constantly approaching the top of the screen. Players must flip blocks to match up three or more in a row.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21935">WildSnake</game><game id="13943">Pac-Attack</game><game id="10515">Magical Tetris Challenge</game><game id="29126">Arkedo Series - 02 SWAP!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12583/371655-dr_mario_and_puzzle_league_screenshot_001.jpg</image></root>
