The game features the same basic story, but has additional locales to visit, more puzzles and tells parts of the story from Nico's perspective. Some of the puzzles also make use of the unique abilities of Nintendo's game consoles and the animated facial expressions have been redrawn by Dave Gibbons.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8851-1.jpg</image></root>
