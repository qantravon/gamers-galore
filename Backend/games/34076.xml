The collection also features an all-new episode set between the events of the original game and its sequel. This game allows players to start with either the Interlude portion, The After Years, or the original Final Fantasy IV story. The only exception is you must complete the first episode of The After Years to open the other episodes, which can be played in any order.The game play is turn based, featuring the Active Time Battle system that debuted in the original version back in 1991. However, fans will find this version to be a bit more difficult than the "easy type" released outside of Japan as "Final Fantasy II"; the game mechanics and enemy difficulty is based on the "hard type" of the game (fans familiar with the PS1 and GBA releases of FFIV will recognize this difficulty. Also, if you are looking for even more of a challenge, you can make the game more difficult by turning on the ATB setting and adjusting the battle speed to the fastest option. Keep in mind that the game is defaulted with ATB off (Wait mode) which will pause the enemy actions whenever you are in the scrolling item or spell menus.The game has additional end-game content included with The After YearsTakashi Tokita directed this game so fans can be sure to expect a faithful telling of the original content. The cinematic cutscenes from the DS remake will also be in this version of the game; they will be digitally remastered to a higher resolution and higher sound quality. The game features high resolution 2D graphics similar to those used in the previous Final Fantasy remakes on the PSP. The game's soundtrack has been remastered to a higher quality but players can still have the option to play the OST.The game includes the extensive end-game content (Ordeal's Secret Cavern and Lunar Labyrinth) that was in the GBA version of the game. There is a bestiary in the game that streamlines data from all save files on your SD card. A gallery mode for viewing Yoshitaka Amano's artwork and a theater mode for viewing CG movies are also in the game. You can also select the gameâ€™s language from English, French or Japanese.
