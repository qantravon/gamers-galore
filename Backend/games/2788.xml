The organization of the game did improve lots. The Improvements could've been better though for detail and accessories. The trading is a little more realistic in this game comared to the other Nhl game that EA made in the past. For example, last years PC version rarely decline a  trade you purposed to make with the computer. This year, the computer reads it and makes a better decision on whether it's a good trade or bad trade...a bad trade will be   declined and a good trade will obviously be accepted.  Snapshot of PC's detail of NHL'00EA sports fixed up the accidentalglitches from their last make ofNHL (PC). Last NHL had a glitch that allowed you to  hit a player through the wall without braking the glass or wall. The player through the wall then would be stuck inthe stands triing to skate to thepuck.  Cover Athlete Defensemen Chris Pronger of the St Louis Blues, who went on to win the Hart Trophy for Most Valuable Player in the NHL that year.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="39">Hockey</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16447">NHL 2K</game><game id="17681">NHL Championship 2000</game><game id="6956">NHL FaceOff 2000</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1795327-box_nhl2000.png</image></root>
