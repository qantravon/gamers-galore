When these objects are broken, the player can sometimes collect power-ups which have either good, dubious, or bad use towards the game and gems which can aid the player in gaining lives.  Downloadable contentOn 2nd June, the first DLC pack for Hyperballoid HD was released through  PSN. This DLC pack adds the Original World level pack(being different from the first two packs in that there is no music, and the backgrounds are not based on a period of time or space, instead just using stock backgrounds), and one new trophy.</description><genres><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game><game id="24062">Arkanoid Live!</game><game id="21608">Arkanoid DS</game><game id="26619">Arkanoid Plus!</game><game id="17164">Arkanoid: Doh It Again</game><game id="14325">Arkanoid 4000</game><game id="8962">Arkanoid 2000</game><game id="14886">Arkanoid: Revenge of DOH</game><game id="8446">Block Breaker Deluxe</game><game id="26465">Shatter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1275252-screen_shot_2010_02_18_at_1.47.45_pm.png</image></root>
