As pirate king, the player rules over a tropical island and is tasked with amassing resources, building up the island's infrastructure, and managing its inhabitants. Additionally, the main source of income is in pirate raids, wherein your ships are sent to patrol various ocean routes to commit piracy. The goal, as ever, is to stay in power for the full duration of the game while fulfilling any number of side goals.The game has a number of scenarios available, and there is a customizable sandbox mode.GameplayA bustling pirate town. Observe the gambling pits, the dive bars and the houses of ill repute.One of the core aspects of gameplay is managing the island's population. Unlike Tropico, there are now two distinct population types: pirate and captive.Pirates serve on your ships and keep captives in line. They will not partake in any manual labor, and will demand a full complement of entertainment establishments on your island: grog, gambling, and wenches. Pirates are creatures of anarchy, and being around buildings which radiate lawlessness increases their satisfaction, while order decreases it.Captives are the lifeblood of your economy, and are gathered from shipwrecks on your island and taken on pirate raids. These slave laborers do all the heavy hauling, resource gathering, crafting and establishment staffing on your island. To be kept in line, they must be instilled with fear and order, both provided by various buildings at your disposal. Should they grow too bold, however, they will attempt to escape your island, and will attempt to reveal its secret location to the colonial powers. Captives can be press-ganged to piracy, though they will begin as the weakest, lowliest type available.Another core element is that of construction. You must provide buildings and infrastructure to keep both your populations in line and to increase in maritime strength. All construction projects require lumber at least, with increasing needs as complexity grows. Pirates will require entertainment facilities and homes to be satisfied, while captives require feeding tents and bunkhouses.Your pirate galleon, ready to set sail for plunder!Managing your fleet ensures a steady source of income and more exotic resources to your island. Players begin with a single sloop but may construct multiple ships of varying strengths to direct on a province-style strategic map of the Caribbean. Each section of the map has ratings for risk, wealth and traffic, as well as which colonial powers are likely to be encountered.Ultimately, the player must oversee these elements and more to stay in power for their full term. Pirate unrest and captive escapes must be managed, a steady source of income must be ensured, and relations with the colonial powers should ideally never reach an invasion.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7Processor: 1.6 GHzMemory: 256 MBGraphics: 128 MB DirectX® 9 graphics cardDirectX®: 9Hard Drive: 3 GBSound: DirectX-compatible</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="995">1701 A.D.</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="6724">1602 A.D.</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="2859">Cultures: Die Saga</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="2815">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="9828">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire – The Eastern Realm</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="4820">Dungeon Keeper 2</game><game id="32175">Dungeon Keeper 3</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="31820">Majesty 2: Pocket Kingdom</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="19932">Emperor: Battle for Dune</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="15960">Evil Genius</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="24980">Grand Ages: Rome</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14741/955066-tropico2.jpg</image></root>
