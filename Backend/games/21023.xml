(Oh shit son, Like you always wanted to!) Obi-Wan Kenobi and General Grievous duelin'!The game looks like the film of the same name (which is leading in to a Fall 2008 television series) with similarly fluid animation.You will fight with Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Grievous and many more. The are also new characters like Ahsoka Tano, a Twil'lek Padawan from the Togrutan race (the Togruta has 3 head tails and the Twi'lek 2). Fighting MechanicsThe fighting mechanics are very simple, you have to make controlled flicks with your wrist. It depends on what movement you make, what kind of attack you do.  Horizontal Slash: light and fast  Vertical Slash: medium and medium  Thrust: heavy damage and slow   Super Moves During load screens you can see commands for each characters super moves. These are movements with the controls similar to combos in other fighting games. Force Powers Like in almost every Star Wars game you will get to use Force powers.
