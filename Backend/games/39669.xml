The user can also use a pencil tool to write a score which plays the notes as they're added, useful if the user is working from sheet music.There also exists a "graphic player" mode which allows users to listen to (and also edit the tempo of) tracks they've created in the music composition mode while an animated scene involving birds and ships plays out above.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8791">Mario Paint</game><game id="21427">Korg DS-10</game><game id="39783">Doremiko</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2309374-famicom_composer_fds.jpg</image></root>
