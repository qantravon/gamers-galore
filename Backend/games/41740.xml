Perfect Choro Q is turn based racing and controls much like a golf game. The player takes turns with the computer opponents, which starts out with the player choosing which direction the car will go in (which is represented by a dotted line.) Once the desired direction is chosen then the power will be chosen by pressing the A button to stop the moving power meter.Perfect Choro Q also has some role-playing elements in that the player drives a car along an overworld map and has multiple destinations that can be chosen. </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2442293-perfect+choro+q+cover.jpg</image></root>
