Of the ten stages, Stage 4 was infamous as being the first to offer 2.5D action. Gradius III was also the first title in the series to offer customizable weapon sets. Most recently, Gradius III has been made widely available through Nintendo's Wii Shop as well as a PSP release in the Gradius Collection.GameplayThe game is infamous as being one of the hardest of the series, as the original arcade version had no way to continue the game upon losing all lives, and a continue system wasn't even in place to be used at the discretion of the owner and operator. The biggest addition is the ability for the player to edit their weapon load-out, that will come with power ups collected through the game. Players can choose predetermined setups or opt to customize their own, though certain variations of weapons are not available between modes.StagesThere are a few differences between the Arcade and SNES versions of the game including some stages being switched around to the SNES having less stages then the ArcadeStage #ArcadeSNESStage 1DesertDesertStage 2BubbleBubbleStage 3Volcano, UndergroundVolcano, UndergroundStage 43D High SpeedMoaiStage 5MoaiFireStage 6CellPlantStage 7FireHigh Speed ZoneStage 8PlantBoss RushStage 9CrystalMechanical Base10 (Part I for Arcade)Boss RushCell10 (Part II, Arcade only)Basen/aHidden Stage 1 (Arcade only)Gradiusn/aHidden Stage 2 (Arcade only)Salamandern/aBosses (SNES)Stage 1GoliathStage 2Bubble EyeStage 3Big Core MK III / Iron MaidenStage 4Twin VaifStage 5Vulture DragonStage 6Choking WeedStage 7BeaconStage 8Zub Rush, Death MK II, Crystal Core, Big Core MK II , Covered Core, Dellinger CoreStage 9Disrupt, Shadow Dancer X2Final StageBacterionPortsSuper NESThe SNES version of Gradius III was released in 1991 and included a reduced difficulty setting and additional load-outs. The slowdown from the arcade version is replicated on this version and doesn't include the 2.5D and Crystal levels present in the arcade version. This version is the only version to include a method to continue the game once all lives are lost. A port was released for Virtual Console on April 23, 2007.Playstation 2The Playstation 2 version of Gradius III was bundled with Gradius IV and was closer to the arcade version of the game and includes the feature that allows you to edit your weapon load-out. Because of the PS2's superior processing speed, an option is included to simulate the slow down of the original arcade game or to let the game play without any lag. This version doesn't have a continue option, but it does let you select any stage you have already cleared.PSPThis version was released in 2006 as part of the Gradius Collection. This version keeps the arcade tradition of not allowing you to continue once you have lost all lives.SoundtrackA soundtrack containing original music and arranged tracks was released by Konami on the Kings Records label on February 21, 1990. This music has been included on other Gradius themed albums, all released by Konami.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5015">Psyvariar: Complete Edition</game><game id="6596">Psyvariar 2</game><game id="119">Söldner-X: Himmelsstürmer</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="3458">R-Type III: The Third Lightning</game><game id="3007">R-Type Delta</game><game id="12266">Arrow Flash</game><game id="7778">Pulstar</game><game id="15999">Darius Twin</game><game id="22403">Metal Black</game><game id="4252">Last Hope</game><game id="18519">Phalanx</game><game id="11684">Contra: Shattered Soldier</game><game id="22998">R-Type Dimensions</game><game id="25402">RayXanbeR</game><game id="25802">Sagaia</game><game id="15505">Biometal</game><game id="14662">Scramble</game><game id="11296">Steel Empire</game><game id="29408">Chou Jikuu Yousai Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie</game><game id="28233">Progear</game><game id="28120">Söldner-X 2: Final Prototype</game><game id="31643">Hydorah</game><game id="32891">Darius</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11236/327583-01_front.jpg</image></root>
