You can also spend money on helper objects such as city maps, newspapers, energizing gum and, of course, film reels for your camera.  There are four main ways of travelling across the continents: boat, bus, train and airplan. Each have their pros and cons, e.g. the bus is the cheapest, but your character will be tired once he reaches his location, while the airplane is the most expensive, but also the fastest and your character gets his sleep.  When your character travels at night, he cannot replenish his energy by any other way than sleeping at a hotel. Furthermore, he is prone to attacks by robbers, who will take half of his money.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13692/943410-39c73cb5_00005303_4e_normal_globetrotter.jpg</image></root>
