The compilation was released in 2000 for the Dreamcast.PlotThe game takes place four years after the events of Street Fighter II. With the defeat of M. Bison and the Shadowloo organization, a new threat rises to power. A religious cult known as the Illuminati who are bent on restoring balance to the world by using terrorist tactics such as: kidnapping, DNA manipulation, and brainwashing. The leader of the Illuminati and the boss of Street Fighter III is a self-proclaimed god named Gill. With a strong belief that the world is going to end, Gill organizes the third World Warrior tournament in hopes of finding the strongest fighters to repopulating the world after it ends.Street Fighter III: New GenerationThe first Street Fighter III was released in 1997 in the arcades. The game features nine brand new characters with two returning characters from the previous games - Ryu and Ken.Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant AttackReleased just months after New Generation, 2nd Impact: Giant Attack adds more characters and stages and new gameplay features to the game.Another returning character from Street Fighter II, Akuma, joins the cast; along with two new characters to the series, Gill's younger brother, Urien, and Hugo. Yang, who was just a pallet swap of Yun, is now giving his own exclusive moves.Characters who shared music themes and stages in the first game, like Ken sharing a stage with Ryu, where now given thier own stage and theme.Existing characters' moves and combo variations have been altered in 2nd Impact. For example, Yun can now combo weak punch, weak kick, and medium punch; which is something he couldn't do in New Generation.2nd Impact also gives the bonus stage its own mode to be played at any giving time.GameplayNew Generation.Like many other Capcom fighting games, Street Fighter III uses six buttons; which are three versions of punch and kick - weak, medium, and fierce. Street Fighter III introduces new gameplay features, some of them coming from other Capcom fighting games.The most noticeable feature of the game is the parry mechanic. It's a gameplay feature that allows the player to parry any attack by pressing forward (High attacks) or down (Low attacks) on the joystick, or D-pad. The parry is use to avoid chip damage which is something that the player suffers when the player decides to block an attack. The air block that was in the Street Fighter Alpha games has be removed, but the parry can be allowed to be performed in mid air.The super combo, now renamed as "super art," returns in Street Fighter III, but now the player must only chooses one of three super arts that each character has. Each super art varies in terms of length of the meter, and the amount of stocks the super art can hold. This adds a tactical aspect to the game.Leap attacks are also feature to be use against ducking opponent. The player taps down twice and punch to do a short jumping attack.2nd Impact.Winning quotes after a match are presented in a unique way. Depending how well the player does will result to a certain quote or if the player fights a certain character. If the player gets a perfect bout, the character's winning quote will acknowledge how easy the fight was. But if the victory was difficult to achieve, the character will react differently to his or her opponent.Introduced in 2nd Impact, the "EX (Extra) special" is a stronger version of a character's special. Once the super meter is filled at a certain length, the player must perform the combination for the special but has to press two attack buttons at the same time.Also introduce in 2nd Impact is the "parry the ball" bonus stage. The game is set up with Sean throwing a number a basketballs at a character and must parry the ball.CharactersRyu"Ryu travels the world seeking true strength. His fighting style is based on Karate.
