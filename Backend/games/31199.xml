The game was released on June 15, 1997. The game was re-released for the Dreamcast in 1999 with a visual mode that included pictures and photos to accompany the story, but the game still relied entirely upon sound and audio cues for game play.The game came as a result of contact that Eno had with blind and visually impaired fans of WARP games. Eno was fascinated that the visually impaired would be fans of his games. He thought his games were very visually rich. He even went so far as to contact some of these fans to find out how they played his games if they could not see the games. As a result Eno decided to make a game that would be audio only, with no graphics at all.Real Sound: The Wind's Regret was a very large influence on further games from Kenji Eno and WARP, Inc. Games that came afterward from the company would take game play elements from Real Sound. Enemy Zero featured invisible enemies that could only be through sound. D2, also from WARP, included parts of the game where the player's character was rendered blind and the player must rely on sound, following a voice to get through the game. D2 also featured a sequence where the character was rendered deaf also.StoryReal Sound: The Wind's Regret story and plot revolved around a love story; the love story between Mizu Sakura and Hiroshi Nonoiti. The two characters meet while still very young in school and fall in love. Mizu and Hiroshi decide to meet one evening to elope. Mizu does not show up at the clock tower where they planned to meet and shortly afterward is transferred to a new school, separated from Hiroshi. The two characters meet coincidentally again. The game continues to follow the characters as Hiroshi is a college student and as Mizu is looking for a job and is starting her career.The game featured the voices of Ai Maeda, an anime voice actress, and Miho Kanno, a Japanese actress and idol singer.GameplayReal Sound: The Wind's Regret was a completely spoken and audio game, as a result the game's game play elements were unique and different than most games that came before it. The player would listen to the game's story, similar in manner to a radio play, and would be prompted at particular times to make decisions in the branching storyline. These decisions would be prompted by an audible chime. Some have described the game play as almost like a audio "choose your own adventure" game.SoundtrackReal Sound ~The Wind's Regret~ The MusicThe soundtrack to Read Sound: The Wind's Regret was composed by Keiichi Suzuki, who is most known for his work on the MOTHER series.
