<root><id>42430</id><name>Actual Sunlight</name><description>Actual Sunlight is a short interactive story about love, depression and the corporation. The game puts you in the role of Evan Winter, a young professional in Toronto, as he moves through three distinct periods of his life. The story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn't change him. Gameplay is minimal, and serves only to move from one part of the (admittedly) text-heavy story to the next. The game fiercely attempts to be worth it.</description><genres><genre>Life Simulation</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17135-1.jpg</image></root>
