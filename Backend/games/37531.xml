The game is heavily inspired by puzzle-platformers like Braid and Limbo, and was created in Game Maker.GameplayAlthough the game is a platformer, the game does not consist of precise, pixel-perfect jumps. Rather, the platforming serves as a way to deliver puzzles involving screen wrap. The player is able to move left and right, jump, and lock the screen. As the player progresses, more complex obstacles are introduced, such as bouncy pigs and streams of acid and water.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/139023/2132661-the_fourth_wall_promo04.jpg</image></root>
