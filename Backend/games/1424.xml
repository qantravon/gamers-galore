The experiment causes an explosion which causes Glover to be thrown off his wearer and the other glove, Cross-Stitch, being thrown into the pot. The explosion has also turned the wizard into stone. Glover is thrown out of the castle by the explosion and the other glove has become corrupted and very evil. Cross-Stitch plans to turn the land into a desolate wasteland, but Glover turns the crystals into balls and must use them to save the land from utter destruction.GameplayIn this game, players control Glover and his ball. There are crystals that the player must rescue using Glover's ball. His ball can be transformed to a bowling ball to crush and break things, a bouncy ball to jump higher, a metallic marble to help attacks, and a crystal ball to ride around on. Players can also collect potions in order to fight better. There are also cards called Garribs, that players can collect so they can unlock bonus levels.LocationsCrystal KingdomAtlantisCarnivalPiratesPrehistoricFortress of FearOUT OF THIS WORLDReceptionLet me give you a hand.Glover received mixed reviews.
