<root><id>13770</id><name>Dr. J and Larry Bird Go One on One</name><description>GameplayIn this game, the player assumes the role of either Julius "Dr. J" Erving or Larry Bird in a mano-a-mano basketball duel, against another player or the computer. There are 2 modes a timed game, or a "play to score" game. On offense your moves are a spin or to shoot(including dunks), and on defense you can attempt to block a shot, or swat at the ball, with over-agressiveness garnering a foul. Also, the players can dunk the ball with such force that it shatters the backboard, sending a janitor out to sweep up the glass, cartoonishly cursing the offending player as he moves across the screen(censored of course).This game was highly lucritive for EA and was ported from the Apple II to many systems. Sequels and RevisionsSince this game was successful, EA decided to make a sequel in 1988, Jordan Vs Bird, was made, this was the same game with updated graphics, new characters, and 2 mini-games a Slam Dunk Contest(as Jordan), or a 3-Point Contest (as Bird).Then, in 1993 Electronic Arts made, Jordan In Flight, for DOS. This game could be concidered a "Revision" featuring more players, a revamped 3-on-3 playing style, and digitized sprites.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20685">NBA Ballers: Chosen One</game><game id="5958">White Men Can't Jump</game><game id="22752">Fox Sports College Hoops '99</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5267/654418-dr_j_and_larry_bird_one_on_one.jpg</image></root>
