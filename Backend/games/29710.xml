However, the game is not considered complete until the player can get through each course in one go without using checkpoints.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34062">Extreme Skill</game><game id="29550">Bit.Trip RUNNER</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/41214/1239593-xboxboxart.jpg</image></root>
