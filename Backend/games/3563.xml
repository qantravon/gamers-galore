The game at the time had great graphics for the Xbox, but on the other platforms for which it was released, it suffered from performance issues and did not sell well. This could partially be attributed to it being ported from Xbox by another developer, Stealth Studios, and released several months later.PlotSet in Hong Kong, you choose between two concurrent story lines with either two female cops trying to arrest Yakuza members or two male spies trying to screw the Yakuza and take down Tiger Takagi.Madoka and MeiOne plays as a Japanese female police officer and a Chinese female police officer in the Hong Kong police force paid to hunt selected Yakuza members. Ho and ChangOne plays as two goofy Chinese spies working for the Hong Kong crime syndicate to uncover the plots of the Yakuza and take over their operations.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3157">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</game><game id="19097">Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition</game><game id="13885">Auto Destruct</game><game id="41052">Critical Velocity</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543580-box_wtym.png</image></root>
