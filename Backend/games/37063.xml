A base deck to start with is unlocked during tutorial and as matches are won, credits are given. These credits are then used to purchase more booster packs from the in-game store. Each booster pack contains one rare, three uncommon, and eight common cards. An alternative way to earn credits is by spending real money for credit bundles. The cards are all themed after characters and locations from Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. The mechanics of the game revolve around a day/night cycle. Each player is recruiting agents, which takes half a day (about 20 seconds), and laying down sites (taking half a day as well). Agents can campaign on one of the three territories scoring influence in that area. Agents can also fight each other and have power and health points much like Magic: The Gathering. When Sites are placed on a territory, they earn periodical influence points every day. Surprise cards in a deck can be used for various effects. Surprise cards can buff up other cards, eliminate them, or return them to the owner's hand. When one player reaches 10 points of influence on a territory, it becomes captured. When two of the three spots are owned by a player, that player wins. Take note that the enemy player can still re-capture owned territories. Matches can last around 5-10 minutes each.</description><genres><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9493/2086616-i454682093_jpg_180x180_q85.jpg</image></root>
