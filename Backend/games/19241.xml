Instead, Midway chose to finish the game and release it for home platforms in 1998. The game, apart from standard ground based moves features a wide variety of aerial moves and mutilations which can instantly sever opponents arms, decapitate or cut in half. What is interesting is that the opponents will keep fighting even if their arms lay on the floor in gallons of blood.Playable charactersBullzeyeBullzeyeDeltaMinatekPsyclownPurgeSabotageSsapoZipperheadBossesClonusMutilator</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21419">Time Killers</game><game id="10746">Shadow Man</game><game id="17212">Evil Dead: Regeneration</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/233/335123-us_boxfrunt.jpg</image></root>
