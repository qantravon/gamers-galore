Unlike the PC/360/PS3 version of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen by Luxoflux and Beenox, Krome Studios' game features linear progression through a smaller number of different missions, but allows for 2 player cooperative play throughout the campaign (with the second player assuming the role of a floating shield and weapon system). The PSP version was adapted by Savage Entertainment. The DS versions of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen are again released separately in an Autobot and Decepticon campaign version.ReceptionRevenge of the Fallen has received negative reviews from critics, more so than its Luxoflux developed counterpart. As of July 2009, the PS2 release holds a Metacritic average of 4.2 while the Wii release maintains a 5.3. Chief complaints are that the action is repetitive, the campaign is too short and there's very little in the way of actually transforming.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2352276-box_tfrotf.png</image></root>
