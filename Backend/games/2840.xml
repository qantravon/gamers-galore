It's the player's job to hit the target as hard as possible and battles are won by depleting the enemy's health bar. A mechanical punch pad is used to cushion the blow. The player is allowed 3 hits to do as much damage as needed.The SNES home version plays far more like a regular brawler game instead, as it does not have the boxing glove accessory.Arcade StagesThe game is split over 5 stages:A woman being attacked by a thug.A baby carriage on the freeway, about to be hit by a truck.A group of terrorists controlling a building.A gargantuan crab wrecking havoc on a cruise ship.An asteroid nearing the earth.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2536">Altered Beast</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game><game id="18293">Renegade</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="1115">Mighty Final Fight</game><game id="14608">Final Fight 2</game><game id="5231">Final Fight CD</game><game id="8241">Final Fight 3</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game><game id="18122">Streets of Rage 2</game><game id="15924">Streets of Rage 3</game><game id="4325">Magic Sword</game><game id="33387">UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364763-snes_sonicblastman.jpg</image></root>
