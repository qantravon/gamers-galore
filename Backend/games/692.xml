It is an upgraded version of the game, and includes new levels based on the Genesis Contra game, Contra: Hard Corps.Fighting a boss.Many changes were made from the original game. Smart bombs and the ability to hold two weapons at once were removed. The top-down view stages were also removed and replaced with levels from Contra: Hard Corps. These stages are exceptionally hard, mostly because of the fact that the levels are designed with the slide mechanic in mind (a mechanic which Contra Advance doesn't have). Contra Advance also has the ability to lock the aim of the gun. In addition, upon picking up a new weapon, the other weapon is dropped, giving the player the option to switch back if necessary.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="847">Metal Slug</game><game id="840">Metal Slug 2: Super Vehicle - 001/II</game><game id="1063">Metal Slug 3</game><game id="2018">Metal Slug 4</game><game id="7378">Metal Slug 5</game><game id="18525">Metal Slug 6</game><game id="20743">Metal Slug 7</game><game id="18">Metal Slug X: Super Vehicle - 001</game><game id="13904">Ninja Five-O</game><game id="26481">Bionic Commando</game><game id="30945">Bionic Commando Rearmed 2</game><game id="17975">xXx</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1841704-box_contraa.png</image></root>
