Having an identity shift, they're taking it out on themselves with physical abuse. Dub, a turtle that won't ever stop exercising.  Kroko, a crocodile that hides behind a pillow that it uses as a fetish.  Lilo, a hippo that can't work out the simplest of problems. And Sly, a snake that seems to be suffering from depersonalization.  An additional character was added after release.  Dr Wood is a sort of crow-like creature that visists all of the patients and writes notes. As of yet, he's not interactive.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2255659-tapcfactboxart.jpg</image></root>
