<root><id>7386</id><name>Divine Divinity</name><description>OverviewDivine Divinity is an action RPG released in 2002. It was the debut title by Larian Studios, located in Belgium.PlotThe story revolves around your character and his or her adventures through the magical realm of Rivellon. As the story moves forward, you learn of a demonic presence that was banished many years ago from the land by a council of mages that is slowly returning to a world full of distrust and hatred amongst different factions.GameplayEquipment ManagementThe gameplay is similar in style to action RPG's like Diablo, while containing a more open-ended world, optional quests and a levelling system that have more in common with traditional RPG series such as Ultima or Elder Scrolls. The player begins by choosing either a Survivor, Warrior or Wizard as their beginning class which also determines beginning skills. As in most of these titles, the character gains experience which allows points to be used for various skills such as lockpicking, defense, healing, etc., each of which has several levels of proficiency. In an unorthodox twist, all potential skills are open to the player to choose from, regardless of their starting class.SoundtrackThe music from the game was never officially released as an album but the tracks are available from the composer, Kirill Pokrovsky's website ( http://www.kirillpokrovsky.com/ ) for free.Tracklist00 - Warrior01 - Dwarven Clockwork02 - Sorching Wind03 - Tangible Suspense04 - The Garden at the Edge of Nowhere05 - Roads Shaded by Green Eaves06 - Those who roam in the sewers07 - Halls Beneath the Ground08 - Crypts and Catacombs09 - Horror of the Walking Bones10 - Omnious Warnings11 - The Song of the Wind12 - Sighs of the Elvenkind13 - Forsaken by the Gods14 - Warring Winds and Crimision Tides15 - Drunk with Dwarven Mirth16 - The Flags of Freedom Fly High17 - Against Doom and Despair18 - The Four Seasons Singing19 - Heartbeats of Undeath20 - A Wind of Aleroth21 - Stones and Trees22 - They Whom Have Left Long Ago23 - Whispers from a Council Past24 - A Sense of Disorientation25 - At the Edge of Death26 - Just in Time for an Ale27 - An Aveune of Lost Tales28 - Run, Zanaldor, Run!29 - Relentless Wandering30 - The Lake of Eternal Darkness31 - Suffering and Shame32 - A Forest Dark and Deep33 - On the Brink of Defeat34 - Something is Amiss35 - Old Rivertown36 - Lies and Chaos37 - Stronghold of the Orcs38 - A Perilous Path39 - Dancing with Mirth40 - Divine Divinity41 - Conclusion of a Destiny42 - War and Peace43 - Winds of Sand44 - Bitva (Battle)ReceptionDivine Divinity recieved generally positive reviews, and was highly praised for containing some of the most highly detailed graphics in a 2D game, an immersive soundtrack, and a relatively easy-going and occasionally humourous tone at a time when most fantasy RPGs contained dark and serious subject matter.Original System RequirementsWindows 98/2000/XP/MEPentium II 450MHz128MB RAM (Recommended: 256 MB)8MB DirectX compatible Video Card4X CD-ROM driveDirectSound compatible Sound Card2.5GB Hard Drive Space640x480 Resolution (Recommended: 800x600)AvailabilityDivine Divinity was re-released on GOG.com for $5.99</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5985">Diablo</game><game id="3958">Nox</game><game id="52">Baldur's Gate</game><game id="1119">Diablo II</game><game id="10637">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</game><game id="20803">Diablo III</game><game id="1727">Dungeon Siege II</game><game id="2025">Revenant</game><game id="11345">Depths of Peril</game><game id="5776">Legend of the North: Konung</game><game id="3549">Konung 2: Blood of Titans</game><game id="31832">Konung III: Ties of the Dynasty</game><game id="12">Blade &amp; Sword</game><game id="39513">Sacred 3</game><game id="32562">Path of Exile</game><game id="8590">Dawn of Magic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/625324-371215_43735_front_1_.jpg</image></root>
