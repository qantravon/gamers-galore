You are taken in by a local head of the shrine. He introduces you to his lovely daughter who took care of you while you were passed out. You reveal to him that you have no parents and were thrown out of the monster breeder academy. He seems to trust you and think that you're a good seed because he ends up giving you a plot of land to start a ranch on. How thoughtful! This... is where your monster training journey begins!</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11572">Jade Cocoon 2</game><game id="23375">Gangway Monsters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2367502-box_mr4.png</image></root>
