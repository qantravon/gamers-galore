Samurai Shodown 64 has large, muti-tier stages allowing the 3D fighters to knock each other through doors and other sections of the stage, making it the first game to feature this game mechanic. This game is also part of the official storyline of the Samurai Shodown franchise as the plot takes place one-year after the events of Samurai Shodown 2. This is also where Shiki, the dual-katana swordswoman, is first introduced to the franchise as the final boss of the game.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24878">Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage</game><game id="25990">Samurai Shodown SEN</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5166/840101-samurai_shodown_64__flyer_.png</image></root>
