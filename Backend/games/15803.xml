Additionally, combat was weak as players simply selected between the enemy leader, the weakest enemy, and the strongest enemy. StoryYou play as Jak, son of Shea Ohmsford. You meet a man called Allanon in Shady Vale, and he tells you of the return of the Warlock Lord. Jak enters the land of Shannara, and decides to track down this Warlock Lord to prevent his return.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23617/1267387-shannara.jpg</image></root>
