The main selling point of the game was the ability to punch your opponents during the game as a means of stealing the ball. Your team consisted of one of eight different players:  Blade Hammer Lewis Mohawk Moose Reggie Tyrone Vinnie  All of the players had their own specific advantages. Mohawk was the best fighter while Lewis was the best shooter. Some later editions of the game did have some NBA teams in it, such as the Phoenix Suns as selectable characters. And the backboard shattering dunks popularized in the game were carried over to its more influential follow-up, NBA Jam.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="22">Basketball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16928">NBA Jam</game><game id="18478">Basketbrawl</game><game id="13548">Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball</game><game id="10512">NBA Hangtime</game><game id="7155">Pigskin 621AD: Ancient Archrivals on a Rampage</game><game id="22306">HoopWorld</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2368999-genesis_archrivals.jpg</image></root>
