There are also  mini-games that utilize the pictures taken, such as a juggling game and a vertical space shooter. It was awarded The World's Smallest Digital Camera by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1999. An optional printer could also be used in tandem with the camera that could print the pictures via heat-based printing technology, instead of conventional ink. These pictures could then be stuck to objects via an adhesive backing.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2318026-untitled.png</image></root>
