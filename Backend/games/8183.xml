Usually the objective is either to eliminate the majority of the enemy forces, or to capture key enemy cities. Like previous entries in the 'General' series there are light RPG elements where the player's soldiers carry over from battle to battle, leveling up and being upgraded. There is also a research element to the game. As battles are won, a percentage (which is determined for each unit by the player) is spent on creating new units. At first only mortal units are available, but as the story progresses the player gains access to mechs and immortal units which each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Each unit can carry up to one magical item which adds more RPG flavour to the experience.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12719">Advance Wars</game><game id="6780">Pacific General</game><game id="3877">Allied General</game><game id="1298">Panzer General</game><game id="14257">Panzer General II</game><game id="35846">Memoir '44 Online</game><game id="1520">Fire Emblem</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/728259-51qjmpf704l._sl500_aa240_.jpg</image></root>
