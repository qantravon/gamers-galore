<root><id>17208</id><name>Wibarm</name><description>Wibarm was developed and released by Arsys Software for the NEC PC-88 and PC-98 computers in Japan and ported to MS-DOS for Western PCs by Br√∏derbund Software. The game was ahead of its time, as it was possibly the first video game on any home system to use polygonal 3D graphics, as well as an early example of a shooter-RPG hybrid.In Wibarm, the player controls a mech robot that can transform between a mech, plane and car. The game switches between a 2D side-scrolling view while exploring the outdoor open world to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses are fought in an arena-style 2D shoot 'em up battle. In contrast to first-person RPGs at the time that were restricted to 90-degree movements, Wibarm's use of 3D polygons allowed full 360-degree movement in the 3D sections of the game. The game also featured a variety of weapons and equipment as well as an automap, while the player could upgrade equipment and earn experience to raise stats like many RPGs.In 1988, Arsys Software's Star Cruiser was in many ways a successor to Wibarm, building on its 3D graphics, gameplay mechanics, and open-world exploration.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36497">Star Cruiser</game><game id="14476">Thexder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/139866/1970215-297_wibarm_dos_screenshot_title_screen_2s.png</image></root>
