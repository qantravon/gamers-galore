The only problem is that the aliens can summon an army of zombies to fight for them. So you have to slash and burn a lot of zombies before you can kill the actual alien.You can play this game with up to 4 teammates, and each can play the hero of their choice which are four in total. The game uses a top-down view to show the troop movements and give you a nice range of weapons at your disposal.
