The game taxed you with saving some friends who had been abducted and were being held captive in a volcano. The gameplay was simple side scrolling "beat em up" with simple plat forming elements and the occasional shooting and flying mechanics thrown in for good measure.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/126726/1765868-giant_bomb_sub_2.jpg</image></root>
