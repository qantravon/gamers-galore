It is loosely based on the Little Red Riding Hood series.GameplayThe gameplay in Little Red Hood is rather complex. Although the game features an overhead view like The Legend of Zelda, the gameplay itself is hard due to errors in code. The goal of the game is to have Little Red Hood find staircases, but to find them she must defeat enemies and find keys. Items and fruit also can be found.Hit detection in the game is very poor. Although Little Red Hood has a kick, but can only be used to knock items out of a tree. You can only find a random dog under rocks that will randomly run around and eat the enemies. You are able to buy slingshots from the shops to attack enemies.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8542">Super Noah's Ark 3D</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58235/1217522-little_red_hood_cover.jpg</image></root>
