The paddle used to bounce balls off of is something that vaguely resembles a penis and testicles while the ball has been replaced a very naked, very horny, very pixelated man. The goal of the game is to use the paddle to bounce the man into the naked women; when all the women have been hit, the game has been won.A variant of the game, Bachelorette Party, uses a woman as the ball and the objective is to hit naked men.</description><genres><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14802">Custer's Revenge</game><game id="7401">Bachelorette Party/Burning Desire</game><game id="9389">Bachelor Party/Gigolo</game><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="1055">Super Breakout</game><game id="21608">Arkanoid DS</game><game id="24062">Arkanoid Live!</game><game id="15107">Arkanoid</game><game id="17164">Arkanoid: Doh It Again</game><game id="14325">Arkanoid 4000</game><game id="8962">Arkanoid 2000</game><game id="14886">Arkanoid: Revenge of DOH</game><game id="6420">X-Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/634788-b_bachelorparty_front.jpg</image></root>
