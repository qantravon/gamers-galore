The game was revealed in a Nintendo Direct on January 23, 2013 detailing the future of Wii U. "X" is scheduled for a worldwide release in 2014.See anything you like?The reveal trailer showcased a huge open world with mechs (the player's mech is apparently called a "Doll" in this game) the player can enter and use to fly around and fight in which can also transform into ground vehicles like bikes or tanks. The real-time battle system looks similar to that of Xenoblade Chronicles.In the video, a text chat window and three other players could be seen, suggesting online co-op play. The UI suggests possibly up to five people playing together, represented by the green dots in the game's mini-map. At the end of the trailer, there is a close up shot of a character who looks almost exactly like a slightly older version of Shulk, protagonist of Xenoblade.The game also appears to have a day-night cycle like Xenoblade as well as dynamic real-time weather effects. The trailer also appears to pay homage to the first Xeno title, Xenogears, with the red X logo at the end as well as the mech designs in the game.The reception to the trailer has been very positive, with spectators praising the vast open world and realistic graphics, considering it a showcase of the Wii U's potential, along with the gameplay elements shown.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42860">Titanfall</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2419545-x_logo.jpg</image></root>
