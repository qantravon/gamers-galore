It is a 2d sidescrolling action adventure game where you play as the now sentient, self aware robot Number 5 (later known as Johnny 5).GameplayÂ The game is structured into 2 parts, the first of which you attempt to escape the laboratory by using your laser and jumping as well as collecting software and hardware upgrades. The second part follows your escape where you must avoid soldiers and wildlife. The second part however differs from the first as it runs on an infinite loop and cannot be beaten.The Amstrad CPC Version The Amstrad CPC version differs from the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in that the first is viewed in third-person 3D, as Johnny 5 moves from room to room through various doors. Objects can be picked up to allow him to jump and fire. You can use objects in your possession, take them by searching desks, or link to some of the available computers to use their functionality. In the second stage, armed with jumping and shooting abilities, Johnny 5 must simply escape as quickly as he can. Guards and Other robots are giving chase, and should be shot. Your robot becomes increasingly depressed when he kills wildlife, and this can eventually cost you a life, so make sure you jump or duck around them.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/57793/1361474-1407_1.jpg</image></root>
