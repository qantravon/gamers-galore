The game is available for PC, Mac, Linux, and is playable in Flash format. Air Pressure explores the relationship between a boy and a metaphorical girl, who he has become dependent on. Throughout the game, his internal monologue reveals how unhappy he truly is with the relationship, and how he wishes he could depend on himself. Air Pressure has three different endings; one where the boy continues the relationship, and wakes up in a hospital, hinting that the girl is a metaphor for either self-mutilation or a drug addiction, another ending where he continues the relationship (although in this ending he has a mutual acceptance for the girl), and a third, "good" ending where he cuts off his dependency with the girl, and decides to live a new life.The game is available for free from Bento Smile's website.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35920">The Life of a Pacifist is Often Fraught With Conflict</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1842150-airpressure_title.png</image></root>
