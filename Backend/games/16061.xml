It is a platform game in which the characters are searching for the twelve zodiac signs. The game appeared on the Sega Master System and also in the arcades. The two versions are very similar, although the arcade version features superior graphics and a two-player co-operative mode. The arcade release came first, a mere month after the release of Alex Kidd in Miracle World. The Master System port came later, with the Wii Shop release coming in 2009.GameplayAlex Kidd: The Lost Stars features Alex Kidd (and Stella, if playing the Arcade version in multiplayer) searching for the twelve star signs of the Aries Constellation, which were stolen by Ziggurat. Ziggurat previously tried to capture them some 5,000 years ago but was stopped by Alex Kidd. Now, you have to go through twelve levels (and then go through them again...) to save Miracle World.There are seven levels in the game. At the end of the seventh level, you are teleported back to the first level and must redo the six levels again; this time facing different or a greater amount of enemies than before. Items around the levels include a 'J' block which allows Alex to jump higher, 'S' which replenishes arrows, and 'SP' which replenishes time. If time runs out, Alex loses a life and must start over from the nearest check point.StagesThe game features seven stages which Alex Kidd must complete before facing Ziggurat.Aries  LibraThe first stage features a whimsical setting. Packs of cards and small dogs challenge Alex Kidd in this stage.Taurus  ScorpioThe second stage of the game is set in a futuristic environment.
