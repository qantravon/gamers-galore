It is set in an abstract world built on sounds and structures inspired by electronic music. The puzzles are musical in nature and solving them teaches the player about electronic sound design and music creation concepts, specifically focusing on the tools presented to the player within the Fract world. Players explore the world, rebuilding abandoned and broken machinery, which they can then use to create their own sounds and music. Much of the sound throughout the game is synthesized in realtime.DevelopmentFract OSC is a project developed in Montreal, Canada by indie developer Phosfiend Systems. It began as a student project at the Ubisoft Campus of University of Montreal using the Unity Engine. The initial prototype was completed in 2010. Due to favorable response, it was further refined and updated versions were presented at both the Independent Games Festival and the 2011 Game Developers Conference. Development continues, and a 2012 release on both PC and Mac is scheduled.AwardsStudent Showcase Award - Independent Games Festival 2011Best Student Game - Independent Games Festival 2011External LinksOfficial Fract OSC website</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37862">Kairo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/108975/2164305-fract_cover.jpg</image></root>
