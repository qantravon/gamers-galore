The sequel to both the original Castlevania and Vampire Killer, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest abandons the traditional stage-based linear platforming system of the original Castlevania for a free-roam platforming system built upon exploring a large 2D world while collecting items (similar to both its predecessor Vampire Killer as well as Metroid, hence the Metroidvania sub-genre). This style of gameplay did not return in future Castlevania games until Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.Set in the year 1698, the game opens seven years after heroic vampire hunter Simon Belmont defeated Count Dracula in the first Castlevania. Simon realizes that during the encounter Dracula placed a fatal curse upon him. The player controls Simon as he tries to rid himself of his curse by gathering the five remains of Dracula's body and burning them in the ruins of Dracula's castle, all while fighting the Count's dark minions haunting the land. Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is one of the earliest games to feature multiple endings, in which Simon's fate is determined by the amount of time spent playing the game.GameplaySimon's Quest was a unique platformer for its time, boasting a number of fresh, innovative ideas. While its predecessor was a straightforward platformer, Simon's Quest is more comparable to Metroid with its exploration elements. The player has the freedom to travel around to different towns and dungeons. Simon can talk to townspeople for hints and directions in his quest. There are merchants in the towns who sell items useful for Simon's quest. The game uses hearts as currency, collected when they are dropped by defeated enemies.Through the woodsThe game was among the first games to employ RPG elements without also being strictly an RPG itself. The game has an experience rating system which uses hearts to raise Simon's level. When Simon levels up, his health will increase and the number of hearts required for the next level will also increase. Simon can also upgrade his weapons, such as finding new whips in a number of locations throughout the game.Simon's Quest featured a very complex and innovative day and night system. Each phase will only last a few minutes, but they have a substantial impact on the gameplay in each level. During the daytime, the enemies outside of town are weaker and fewer. During the night, enemies become more dangerous, and appear more frequently. During the night, the townspeople and merchants will be unavailable, as they presumably are getting a little bit of shut-eye. Unfortunately for Simon, zombies wander the towns at night too.In townMany elements of the original game are retained for the sequel, so not everything in Simon's Quest is new. Magic secondary weapons make a return, such as the Holy Water and the dagger. Most of the sub-weapons require hearts to use. Each one has a different unique function and each is useful in different situations. Additionally, the body parts Simon gathers will provide some extra utility, such as the projectile blocking rib bone.Primary Weapons: Whippin' it goodFlame Whippin'Leather Whip: The initial weapon possessed by Simon BelmontThorn Whip: An upgrade obtained in the first town, Jova, for 100 hearts.
