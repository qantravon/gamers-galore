Line clears in Not Tetris 2 are based on horizontal block density instead of explicitly filling in an entire row with blocks as in classic Tetris.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1896">Tetris</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/110494/2089212-screen_shot_2011_12_22_at_2.16.36_pm.png</image></root>
