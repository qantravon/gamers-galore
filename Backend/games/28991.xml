<root><id>28991</id><name>Hanjuku Eiyuu</name><description>OverviewHanjuku Hero ("Soft-Boiled Hero") is the first in a series of real-time strategy RPGs by Square and Bits Laboratory. The goal is to raise troops and send them marching towards enemy locations, conquering any armies within and along the way. The game has a comedic edge to it, having plenty of examples of goofy humor in the midst of all the warfare.Battles take place automatically when two enemy forces meet: These battles are simply automated wars of attrition, with the side with the greater power usually emerging the victor.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11439">Herzog Zwei</game><game id="8403">Final Fantasy</game><game id="2464">Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen</game><game id="40402">King of Kings</game><game id="40726">Fairytale</game><game id="18732">Lord Monarch</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360656-hanjuku_hero.jpg</image></root>
