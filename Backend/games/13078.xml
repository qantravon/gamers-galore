<root><id>13078</id><name>SOS</name><description>OverviewSOS is a side-scrolling, free-roaming, survival adventure game released on the SNES in Japan in 1993 and in North America in 1994. In this game, you control a person onboard a passenger liner in the early 20th century when it hits a storm and capsizes. You must navigate the shifting ship's destroyed corridors and rescue and lead to safety as many passengers as possible, all while the ship gradually fills with water. This is a unique example of a free roaming objective based game. There are many ways to get to the top of the ship, and you can end up there alone, or with a large group of survivors. Although the game is extremely tense, the only threat is from the time limit and the risk of death from falling too great a distance. You can choose to play one of four passengers, all with slightly different starts.Starting CharactersCapris WisherRedwin GardenerJeffrey HowellLuke HainesExternal linksSOS at Hardcore Gaming 101</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38417">Wake</game><game id="31949">Clock Tower: The First Fear</game><game id="21151">Hydrophobia</game><game id="21107">I Am Alive</game><game id="2407">Disaster Report</game><game id="1160">The Firemen</game><game id="36989">The Last of Us</game><game id="32903">Swan Song</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/825238-927296_66095_front.jpg</image></root>
