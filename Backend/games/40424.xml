In this incarnation, players take control of a young man named Kyou, who is trapped in the Denjuu World when a sinister Denjuu called Diablos destroys all but one of the Antenna Trees, which are the conduit between the human world and the Denjuu World. Kyou must raise his Denjuu partners and prevent Diablos from destroying the last Antenna Tree.Also like the previous game, bootleg versions with Pokémon qualities shoehorned were produced, although they were not as prominent. Pokémon Jade 2 and Pokémon Diamond 2 have only been found in ROM form in Chinese. An English version under the name of Pokémon Ruby was also produced.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10122">Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire</game><game id="40423">Keitai Denjuu Telefang</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2362135-telefang_2_logo.gif</image></root>
