In 2007,    Capcom employed the developer    Big Rooster in order to release a downloadable video game.  It was to be made available on        XBLA and       PSN.  A PC version was also to be released.  Unfortunately, undisclosed problems were encountered that ultimately prevented Capcom from releasing the game.  Capcom's Senior Director of Strategic Planning and Research, ,  stated that after a misfire at the start of the project, moving it to other developers would probably cost more than the revenue it would generate.  As of 2008, rights reverted back to Games Workshop. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/21249/888303-talisman.jpg</image></root>
