Also the speed of the game is directly controlled by the speed of the PC, meaning that if someone played it on anything faster than a 386 computer the cars would drive incredibly fast.EnvironmentsThe races are done on five sections of a California course. The sections offer multiple routes to the finish line and it is possible to drive off-road. The roads are populated with other cars and police vehicles. The police will chase and ticket both the player and computer opponents if they are caught speeding. The off-road environments are populated with many things, like hills, farms, billboards, ponds, trains, and livestock. Some sections have weather effects like rain and snow, requiring the player to turn on the windshield wipers. But even when it's not raining or snowing, the player is sometimes required to use the wipers to remove bugs from the windshield.Other featuresThe game offered different radio stations, all playing one MIDI song over and over again.CarsChevrolet CERV III (concept car) Lamborghini Diablo Pininfarina Mythos (concept car produced by Ferrari) </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6628">Test Drive 6</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2238/360221-td3_9.png</image></root>
