<root><id>19860</id><name>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs</name><description>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is the first  SNES release of the popular      Battletoads series, continuing the trend of ludicrous humor and storylines, coupled with brutal difficulty established by its predecessor,       Battletoads. The traditional   side-scrolling beat 'em up gameplay mechanics are retained, but with the introduction of racing elements to certain levels. Continuing the ludicrous story from the original game, Battlemaniacs sees the 'toads sucked into an arcade machine and setting out to rescue kidnapped ladies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1850">Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game><game id="4816">Double Dragon II: The Revenge</game><game id="10152">Bucky O'Hare</game><game id="10696">Captain America and the Avengers</game><game id="24997">Eduardo the Samurai Toaster</game><game id="18034">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time</game><game id="11404">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The HyperStone Heist</game><game id="29491">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363657-snes_battletoadsinbattlemaniacs.jpg</image></root>
