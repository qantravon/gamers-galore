Currently in beta, it is planed to be Free-to-Play with a micro transaction system. On one side you can join the humans and play a FPS trying to defend your base for a certain amount of time, one bonus goal is to kill a swarm master which is one of the players controlling the RTS side of things. As the swarm master it is your job to one keep your self safe and to lead your bugs. At this time there doesn't seem to be any real downside of dieing on either side.   Batteswarm does offer equipment upgrades these items include shields, armor, guns and grenades. For the bug side of things you can upgrade the type of  bugs you have as well of some special abilities. These items are rented and will be gone after certain amount of time after you buy them. Currently the game offers very few things to equip that are bought with the in-game currency, there is a heavy focus on the micro transaction equipment.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160705/2239814-battleswarmscreen2.jpg</image></root>
