The arcade version is controlled using a trackball, and takes its name from the castles the player inhabits in order to obtain the "Crystals" or "Gems". It is one of the firstarcade games to feature a definitive ending, as apposed to continuing until a loss of lives. The game was both published and developed by Atari, Inc.The Atari 5200 version of the game, as a casualty of the video game crash of the 1980s, was developed but never released. A working prototype of the game is actively traded between Atari enthusiasts.Easter EggsMoving into the southeast corner of the first level and jumping at least 100 times causes the word Atari to appear in level 1-2On level 5â€’4, killing Berthilda and going to the corner of the area where she was and jumping, causes "FXL" to appear in the southeast corner of the screen.
