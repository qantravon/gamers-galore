Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the "collecting videotape" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by Gray Matter Interactive), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from "T" to "E"). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater.Gameplay EnhancementsWhile THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes.Create-a-SkaterCreate-A-Skater editor menuTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create your own skater, allowing you to play through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar of yourself or a custom edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for your character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.Create-A-Skater's Special Tricks menuThe ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign.Park EditorThe Park Editor's toolsetAn example of a custom gapAlso a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the "Manuals" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.New grind tricksA less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash CollectablesCash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character.LevelsHangarLocation: Mullet Falls, MontanaHangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.
