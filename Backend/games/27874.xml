The balls will roll along a path on the screen and your job is to prevent them from reaching the end of the path. You control a frog that is situated somewhere on the level and is given a random colored ball. Using your mouse, you control where the frog is aimed and fire at the string of balls. When three or more balls of the same color are touching, they will disappear and you will gain points. Once you reach a certain score in each level, the balls will stop coming and you will need to clear the rest in order to beat the level.Xbox Live Arcade PortIt was announced on March 20th, 2012 that Zuma's Revenge would be released on Xbox Live Arcade.
