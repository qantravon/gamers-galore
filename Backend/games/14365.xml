<root><id>14365</id><name>Evil Dead: Hail to the King</name><description>Plot  A few months after the events of Army of Darkness         Ash begins to have nightmares filled with visions of "Deadites" and other beings of the          Necronomicon. Ash and his girlfriend, Jenny, decide to return to the        cabin in the       woods where the whole      Evil Dead ordeal began to try and end the nightmares. Once there Ash runs into his possessed hand that he had previously lobbed off. The hand turns on the     tape recorder with the    incantation to make the Deadites rise and all hell breaks loose. Ash must find the   pages of the Necronomicon to send the Deadites back "once-and-for-all".   Gameplay  Evil Dead: Hail to the King plays very much like an early          Resident Evil game with the real-time action happening over pre-rendered and          fixed camera scenes. Ash is controlled much like a          tank with the left and right directions turning him rapidly and the forward and back moving him backwards.   Combat involves the use of melee weapons and ranged weapons to kill the various Deadites that appear. One of the buttons on the controller is reserved for  taunting with Ash's catchphrases such as "Come get some!"</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11917">Dino Crisis</game><game id="9418">Resident Evil 2</game><game id="4312">Silent Hill</game><game id="5842">Resident Evil</game><game id="15476">Vampire Hunter D</game><game id="5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</game><game id="27715">Resident Evil</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2139776-box_edhotk.png</image></root>
