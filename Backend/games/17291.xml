<root><id>17291</id><name>Atari Karts</name><description>Atari Karts was a kart racing game released for the Atari Jaguar in December 1995. The game was very similar to Mario Kart, but not nearly as popular. Like Mario Kart players can pick up items to help them in the race. Unlike Mario Kart however most of these items just improve your speed or steering (One messes up the opponent's steering but that is the only offensive item in the game). Though the game itself was rather flawed, at the time of its release it did have graphics that were considered to be very impressive. A lesser claim to fame is the fact that this game had the second, and last, appearance of the character Bentley Bear, the hero from the game Crystal Castles.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11174">LEGO Racers</game><game id="20760">Merlin Racing</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365331-jag_atarikarts.jpg</image></root>
