First, digitized graphics took advantage of the newly-released VGA graphics card standard, resulting in a look similar to Mortal Kombat or NARC.Access Software developed RealSound, a way to play back digitized sound through standard PC speakers. At the time, dedicated sound cards such as the SoundBlaster were still expensive, and this technology allowed for an approximation of their quality without the cost.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24043">Countdown</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14440/1374634-714809_968906163_00.jpg</image></root>
