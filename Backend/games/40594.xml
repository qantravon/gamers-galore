<root><id>40594</id><name>Flying Hero</name><description>OverviewFlying Hero consists of a series of single-screen stages of burning buildings, where the goal is to either put out the fires or rescue all the civilians within. This is done by having two firefighters launch the third with their trampoline. The player can also earn rewards by catching items as they fall out of the building, though they must always prioritize the falling firefighter - dropping him will cost the player a life.Aicom developed a similar game for the Sega Master System the previous year named Megumi Rescue. Though there are various differences between the two versions, they have the same premise and play similarly.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40356">Megumi Rescue</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2372360-flying_hero_fc.jpg</image></root>
