The game is therefore also known as Innocent until caught 2 or Innocent until caught (Presumed Guilty). The definitive edition however is the CD-ROM edition that is simply named Guilty. The main character is again Jack T. Ladd who is joined by a female protagonist. Both characters can be controlled by the player and depending on who the player controls the puzzles that will be encountered differ from place to place. At the beginning of the game, Jack is a prisoner of Ysanne, but when her ship crashes onto an alien planet, the two become unlikely collaborators. The game's GFX has been updated but still used the classic   Point  Click interface with iconographic controls, an inventory and a map.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17345">Innocent Until Caught</game><game id="3961">B.A.T.</game><game id="10915">Beneath a Steel Sky</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/720992-23301_boxshot_1.jpg</image></root>
