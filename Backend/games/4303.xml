It was first released on the PC Engine CD in 1993 and saw a re-release in the Tengai Makyou Collection compilation for the PSP in 2008.The game's protagonist is Kabuki, one of the 4 original heroes of Tengai Makyou II. Unlike the previous entries in the series, the battle system does not have a first-person viewpoint, but rather a side view similar to that of the 2D Final Fantasy games. The game is also a bit more lighthearted and humorous than it's predecessors, featuring elements such as villains who sing a song before doing battle with the party.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2094">Final Fantasy II</game><game id="21463">Final Fantasy III</game><game id="20829">Final Fantasy IV</game><game id="4793">Final Fantasy V</game><game id="6336">Final Fantasy VI</game><game id="8403">Final Fantasy</game><game id="1368">Romancing SaGa</game><game id="9030">Romancing SaGa 2</game><game id="2641">Romancing SaGa 3</game><game id="3864">Mother 3</game><game id="11753">Mother</game><game id="3775">Mother 1+2</game><game id="8307">EarthBound</game><game id="16246">Princess Minerva</game><game id="43947">Tengai Makyou Collection</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/1841111-box_tm.jpg</image></root>
