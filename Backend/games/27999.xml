Those stages are the  sewer, a pond, a      meadow, and a cybertechnological machine. The last stage consists of five very hard  boss fights, but that stage can be skipped by choosing the "easy"  difficulty mode. The avatar is a honey bee and the game features the genre-typical array of  weapon upgrades and powerups.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4459">Armalyte</game><game id="3802">Blood Money</game><game id="11071">X-Out</game><game id="15077">Z-Out</game><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="19750">R-Type II</game><game id="8479">Super R-Type</game><game id="15216">Insector-X</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1120851-apidya_cover.jpg</image></root>
