Focusing on atmosphere and tension rather fiendishly difficult puzzles, the game attempts to weave an intricate and complex story.The game begins with an unnamed man waking up in a noose after apparently trying to commit suicide. After freeing himself and exploring the bathroom he was trapped in, he begins to unearth a mystery surrounding the malevolent serial killer Oswald White. Decay quickly sets up an ongoing and deeper narrative as well as playing, thematically, with horror, thriller and supernatural codes and conventions.In terms of gameplay, Decay is like any other stock point and click game, featuring an inventory and item combination. What it lacks in deep mechanics, it makes up for with atmospheric music and jump scares.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11546">Scratches</game><game id="5842">Resident Evil</game><game id="10169">Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh</game><game id="1724">The 11th Hour</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/102230/1447417-xbox_cover.jpg</image></root>
