In War Pig you play in teams. A team can be human or computer controlled.  There are tons of weapons available, starting from ordinary rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, cannons, air-strikes and artillery.   But there is also a lot of little means and nastiness, that make the game what it is.  A player can send a zombie-pig to infect the enemies, he can also send lethal gas.  Of course there is also a hospital pig to heal your warriors and there is also a beamer to quickly get to a save place. In the end, there is only one thing that counts: Live longer than your enemy, even if only one of your pigs survives!</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2007">Worms</game><game id="27139">Worms 2: Armageddon</game><game id="32738">Delve Deeper</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/94457/1370317-warpig_2009_cover_k.jpg</image></root>
