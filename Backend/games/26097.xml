<root><id>26097</id><name>Killing Floor</name><description>OverviewKilling Floor is a cooperative survival horror first-person shooter developed and published by Tripwire for the PC (via Steam) on May 14, 2009. Up to six players fight against waves of "Specimens", failed genetic super-soldiers (from the London-based Horzine Biotech corporation) with zombie-like properties. Along the way, they purchase deadlier weaponry from a roaming Trader and gain persistent experience for each of their character classes (known as Perks, which give the player unique benefits).The game is based on a 2005 mod of the same name for Unreal Tournament 2004. With assistance from the game's original mod team, most of the game's concept and assets were translated over to the final retail version without many changes. Throughout the years, the game received free content packs (including annual special events) and paid DLC (including characters and weapons), including cross-promotions with other games (such as Tripwire's Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad and Valve's Portal 2).The game was later released for the Mac (on May 5, 2010) and most Linux platforms (on November 10, 2012).GameplayAiming Down SightsIn Killing Floor, players team up with up to 5 other players to survive against waves of Specimens, or Zeds as they are more commonly known. Players must kill all Zeds in a wave, and after that, get a period of time to rest and rearm. They will fight through a set number of waves, culminating in a boss wave where players pit their wits against the game's boss, the Patriarch. Most of the maps are set in Great Britain, and the cast of characters all hail from the Isles, featuring many stereotypical accents and slang.There are 5 levels of difficulty in Killing Floor: Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, and Hell on Earth. Each level, and the number players in the team, increases Zed hitpoints, damage, and number spawned per wave. There are also 3 game lengths, Short with 4 waves, Medium with 7 waves, and Long with 10 waves. Most servers run Long games.Game OverAfter every wave, players get a chance to buy new weapons and equipment at the Trader. The Trader is spread out in specific spots in a map, and is open only during the rest period. Players must make their way to her within the rest time allocated, or they will have to fight the next wave with their current equipment and ammunition. She accepts British Pounds (Â£) as currency, which are rewarded to a player for killing Zeds and surviving a wave. Players can also trade cash with each other, which allows newcomers to get equipped with the necessary equipment to survive the next wave.Players can heal themselves, and each other, with their equipped Medical Syringes. These syringes are available for every player, but is limited to the amount of charge they have. Each heal takes up 50 charge, but self-heals take up 100 charge, emptying the syringe. The charges will replenish over time, and the recharge rate is increased with the Field Medic perk.WeldingPlayers can dictate the movement of Zeds by shutting off passageways and doors. They can also weld doors to slow down Zed movement, as they will now have to break down those doors before passing through. Welders are available to all players, and Support Specialists gain welding bonuses in their perk.A special feature called "Zed Time" is triggered when players perform gory kills, such as headshots. Zed Time slows down time for all players, even in multiplayer, for a period of time. The Commando and Berserker perks can increase this bonus time by killing additional Zeds while in Zed Time.PerksPerks are upgradable player classes that each player chooses when they enter the game, granting them special bonuses tied to a particular playstyle (for example, Firebugs excel at fire-based weaponry while Field Medics excel at healing). In-between waves, players have the option to switch to another class (but only once per wave). By performing specific tasks (no matter what Perk they choose), players can gain experience and level up their Perks (to a maximum of six levels), providing additional bonuses.Field MedicField MedicThe Field Medic specializes in healing injured players.

(only in rank 6)SpecimensCommonly referred to as Zeds (or "zombies"), Specimens are failed clones of experimental super-soldiers created by the Horzine Biotech corporation and the main antagonists players will fight. There are ten types of Specimens in the game (including a special boss that is fought at the end of each match).On special events (during Summer, Halloween, and Christmas), each Specimen receives a new appearance and new sounds to match. There are currently four themes:Summer Sideshow - Appears during every Summer event. Each Specimen resembles a different circus attraction (such as the Siren resembling "The Bearded Lady").Halloween Sideshow - Appeared during the Halloween 2011 event. Each Specimen resembles their Summer Sideshow appearances, modified to fit the Halloween theme.Hillbilly Horror - Appeared during every Halloween event past-2011. Each Specimen resembles a different type of hillbilly (such as the Gorefast wielding a banjo).Twisted Christmas - Appears during every Christmas event. Each Specimen has a theme related to Christmas (such as the Patriarch resembling Santa Claus and the Clots resembling his worker elves).ClotThe Clot is the most common Zed in Killing Floor. It does not have any special abilities, nor does it deal much damage, but it can grab players and keep them from moving. This allows more dangerous Zeds to approach distracted players.Clots are clones of Kevin Clamely's deceased son, with genetic alterations to make it tougher than normal humans.BloatThe Bloat has a lot of hitpoints, and spews corrosive vomit on players that stray too near to it. When killed, it will explode, spraying it's vomit around its corpse. The Bloat's vomit can affect surrounding Zeds, and good players can force it to spew vomit on tougher Zeds, transferring aggro to the Bloat.GorefastThe Gorefast, like its name suggests, is a fast moving Zed that wields a long blade grafted on it's left arm. It will chase down players that it sees and cut them open with its blade-arm. Groups of them can mean death for unprepared players.StalkerThe Stalker appears cloaked to players, and will only appear when attacking. It will, however, cast a shadow even when cloaked, which players can use to spot invisible stalkers. Commandos can also see Stalkers if they are close enough.CrawlerThe Crawler is a spider-like creature that can appear in even the smallest cracks, and jump upon unsuspecting players. They like to operate in groups, and their small size and jumping movements make it hard for players to target them.HuskThe Husk is a special ranged Zed that shoots fireballs out of its arm launcher. It will lock onto a player, and shoot them with great accuracy after charging for a short time. It is possible to dodge a Husk's shot as it has a slow travel time and the Husk's moving target compensation can be tricked with proper timing. A high level Firebug is entirely immune to damage the Husk's shots, though the force of the blow will still be felt and the Husk's melee attack will still do damage.The Husk was not found in the original mod, although models of a similar Zed was found in the files.SirenThe Siren is a ranged Zed that inflicts damage with her voice. When a Siren comes within range of a player, it will starting screaming, affecting all in a small radius around her. Her voice will also distort a player's vision, and will go through armor to damage a player's hitpoints directly. A grenade thrown at a screaming Siren will simply disintegrate, damaging no one. It is possible to damage a Siren with grenades if all players are far enough away that the Siren's aggro would not cause it to scream.The Siren is a clone of Kevin Clamely's wife, who wanted to be a singer but lacked talent.ScrakeThe Scrake is a dangerous Zed that wields a chainsaw in place of its right arm. It is normally not very fast, but will become enraged when its hitpoints fall below a certain percentage (based on difficulty). When enraged, it will chase down a player and saw them until they die, then move on to the next.The Scrake was supposed to be a field medic that can work on their patients while taking large amounts of pain.FleshpoundThe Fleshpound is the most dangerous normal Zed in Killing Floor, and can deal tremendous amount of damage in an instant. It moves faster than other Zeds, and can become enraged when it takes a certain amount of damage without attempting to strike a player (This meaning that a player can resent the Fleshpound's rage buildup by inciting it to strike the player) or sees a player continuously for some time. When enraged, it will chase down a player and strike them once with their powerful arms. On higher difficulties, that can mean instant death.PatriarchKevin Clamely, mad with power, tasked his scientists to change him into this form: the Patriarch. He appears in the final boss wave, and players must take him down to win the game. He has a chaingun and rocket launcher on his right arm, and a tentacle attached to his torso, which he uses to attack players. He can cloak better than Stalkers, and has 3 health vials which he uses when his health gets low. He can call upon additional Zeds to aid him in battle, which he does every time he goes to heal.Weapons and EquipmentWeapons from the Twisted Christmas EventAll players in Killing Floor spawn with a set of equipment: a knife, a 9mm pistol, a medical syringe, a welder, and some grenades. Additional weapons must be found in the maps or bought at the Trader after a wave.Each weapon has a cost, measured in Pounds (Â£), and a weight, counted in blocks. Every player has a maximum of 15 blocks (up to 24 for Support Specialists), and can only carry weapons up to their inventory limit.Weapons are divided by perks, and perked characters receive discounts for their respective types of weapons. Higher level perks can spawn with additional weapons or equipment.Most weapons have an alternate fire, which activates a secondary ability like heavy attacks or flashlights.Common Equipment9mm Pistol (Â£150, 4 blocks for akimbo) - Semi-automatic tactical pistol. Although its damage output is overall weak, it is cheap to refill, has decent magazine size, has little recoil, and is good with headshots against weaker enemies. Alternate Fire toggles a built-in flashlight, which has a rechargable battery (that turns off automatically after some time). A 9mm Pistol is starting equipment for all players and cannot be dropped manually or sold. Players can pick up another 9mm Pistol (either dropped by dead teammates, spawned randomly on maps, or bought from the Trader) to dual-wield (sacrificing accuracy for double magazine size). Sharpshooters have increased headshot damage, recoil, and reload speed (conversely with their rank).Knife - A standard combat knife. Despite its weak damage, it has a very fast attack rate and can easily decapitate weak enemies. Pressing Alternate Fire does a slower heavy slash that deals more damage. Players who equip the knife have a faster movement speed. Starting equipment for all players. Cannot be dropped or sold. Berserkers have increased damage, attack speed, and movement speed (with the Knife equipped) (conversely with their rank).Grenades (Â£40, 1 block) - Simple timed grenades that is thrown to clear groups of Zeds. Grenades are thrown with their own separate button and do not need to be equipped manually. Zeds at later difficulties will actively try to avoid thrown grenades. Each player has a limited number of grenades and must replenish them either by picking up ammo boxes (spawned randomly in maps) or by purchasing from the Trader. Cannot be dropped or sold. Grenades thrown by Firebugs (at ranks 3-6) inflict enemies on fire (dealing slightly less damage), while grenades thrown by Field Medics (after the Hillbilly Horror Halloween Event) create a temporary green smoke cloud that heal all allies in the blast radius (while keeping enemies away, dealing slightly less damage in the initial blast). Support Specialists and Demolitions have increased damage and capacity (conversely with their rank).Medical Syringe - A syringe tool with a small, replaceable container filled with healing fluids. Pressing Primary Fire near a teammate (that does not have full health) heals 20 of the teammate's HP (at the cost of 50 charge), while pressing Alternate Fire heals the wielder for 20 HP (at the cost of 100 charge). The charge indicator recharges over time. Starting equipment for all players. Cannot be dropped or sold. Field Medics get increased recharge speed and injection health (conversely with their rank).Welder - A portable welding tool used to block doors and gates against Zeds (forcing them to either beat down the door or find an alternate route). Holding down Primary Fire welds while holding down Alternate Fire un-welds. Multiple players can weld or un-weld the door simultaneously to speed up the process. Both welding and un-welding takes up the tool's battery, which recharges over time. Starting equipment for all players. Cannot be dropped or sold. Support Specialists get increased welding speed (conversely with their rank).Combat Armour (Â£300) - Passive damage absorption equipment, providing players with additional layer of HP. Armor fully absorbs the damage and effects of both Bloat bile and fire, but does not absorb any damage from Siren screams and fall damage. Spawns randomly on maps. Can be repaired between waves for less money. Cannot be dropped or sold. Starting equipment for Field Medics (ranks 5 and 6), Berserkers (rank 6 on Beginner, Normal, and Hard difficulties), and Firebugs (rank 6). Field Medics get both a huge discount and increased damage resistance (conversely with their rank).Berserker (Melee Weapons)All melee weapons have a movement speed boost when equipped, and have an alternate fire consisting of a large swing, which is slower but deals more damage.Machete (Â£100, 1 block) - A simple, lightweight melee weapon that deals more damage than the standard Knife (albeit slightly slower in attacking). Spawns randomly on maps.Fire Axe (Â£150, 5 blocks) - A heavy fire axe that deals more damage than the Machete, but is slower to swing. Alternate fire is a large swing that deals more damage. Spawns randomly on maps.Katana (Â£1000, 3 blocks) - A lightweight sword that combines fast attacking speed (almost as fast as the Knife) with powerful damage (roughly half-way between Machete and Fire Axe). A golden variant can be purchased after getting the Golden Weapons Pack DLC.Chainsaw (Â£1000, 8 blocks) - A loud, heavy chainsaw that provides a powerful constant attack stream (with the exception of alternate fire, which provides a more powerful swing). Eliminates the melee speed boost when equipped, though the increase in damage is kept. A golden variant can be purchased after getting the Golden Weapon Pack 2 DLC.Scythe (Â£1250, 6 blocks) - A heavy scythe that has the most powerful melee swing in the game, but also the slowest melee swing. Can only be purchased if the player has bought the Community Weapons Pack DLC.Claymore (Â£1500, 6 blocks) - A heavy greatsword that sacrifices attacking speed (matching with the Fire Axe) for brutal damage output and long reach.Dwarfs?! Axe (Â£1500, 6 blocks) - A heavy battle axe that functions similarly to the Claymore (with shorter reach), only that each direct hit knocks enemies afar (with exception to larger enemies which are only pushed slightly until killed). Can only be purchased if the player has either purchased Dwarfs!? or acquired an accumulative 40,000 Gold in the free-to-play version of Dwarfs!?.Buzzsaw Bow (Â£2500, 7 blocks) - A specialized crossbow that fires spinning buzzsaws, which cuts through multiple enemies and bounce off surfaces multiple times.

Can only be purchased if the player has bought the Community Weapons Pack DLC.Dr. T's Lead Delivery System (Â£950, 5 blocks) - A steampunk-themed version of the Tommy Gun. Because it is now outfitted with a drum magazine (instead of a box magazine), each magazine carries 10 more bullets. However, both weapons have the same overall ammo capacity (so players carry less magazines). Can only be purchased if the player has bought the Community Weapons Pack 2 DLC.Rising Storm Tommy Gun (Â£950, 5 blocks) - A sub-machine gun that resembles the Tommy Gun (in both appearance and stats). Because it is now outfitted with a larger drum magazine, each magazine carries 20 more bullets (making it the rifle with the largest magazine size in the game).

It has the same powerful stats to the SCAR Mk.17, with the exception of higher rate-of-fire, lower recoil, slightly heavier weight, higher cost, and the inclusion of an ACOG scope (that, when viewed down-the-sights, provides better zoom and steadier aim at the cost of being more obtrusive).Demolition (Explosive Weapons)M79 (Â£1250, 4 blocks) - A single-shot grenade launcher that is used to clear small groups of Zeds. A golden variant can be purchased after getting the Golden Weapons Pack DLC.Orca Bomb Propeller (Â£1250, 4 blocks) - A single-shot portable cannon that functions similar to the M79.
