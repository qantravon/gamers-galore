The protagonist, Timmy, dies after one hit, just like the Kid from IWBTG. His only method of attack is shooting projectiles straight forward. The structure follows a typical metroidvania style format, with multiple paths to take within a large area rather than completely separate levels. There are also several upgrades to be obtained throughout the game.Other infoSivak released a demo for BK:FoP shortly before the game's release. The demo took the form of a rom containing the opening area of the game to be played on an emulator.Sivak is currently working on Battle Kid 2The box cover art was designed by British video game television presenter, "Guru Larry" Bundy Jr.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22845">I Wanna Be The Guy</game><game id="22517">La-Mulana</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3017/1229917-battle_kid_box_art_01.jpg</image></root>
