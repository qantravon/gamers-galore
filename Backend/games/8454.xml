The game lets you take control of one of your favourite Premiership sides and guide them through the 1999/2000 season and beyond. The player must not only manage the team by changing tactics and tweaking training schedules, as manager you take control of the finances of your team. This means doing things like apllying for loans, increasing or decreasing entry fees to games, scheduling stadium improvements, choosing sponsors and advertising, managing player and staff wages and buying/selling players on the transfer market. Premier Manager 2000 allows two ways of experiencing matches. The first is simple text updates which scroll up the screen, commenting on big match occurences like a goal being scored or player getting injured. The second way lets the player to watch the match in full 3d, allowing them to control the camera, fast foward/rewind time or skip to important match moments.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13">Premier Manager 98</game><game id="7009">Premier Manager 97</game><game id="20784">Football Manager 2008</game><game id="1467">FA Premier League Football Manager 2000</game><game id="454">FIFA Soccer Manager</game><game id="13818">Football Manager</game><game id="6697">Premier Manager Ninety Nine</game><game id="9111">Championship Manager: Season 03/04</game><game id="5444">Championship Manager 4</game><game id="10269">Championship Manager 2006</game><game id="10532">Championship Manager 3</game><game id="3753">FIFA Manager 07</game><game id="5605">FIFA Manager 06</game><game id="19272">FIFA Manager 07: Extra Time</game><game id="13578">Championship Manager 2</game><game id="10275">Championship Manager: Season 00/01</game><game id="8563">Championship Manager: Season 02/03</game><game id="22092">LMA Manager 2007</game><game id="17090">LMA Manager</game><game id="4728">LMA Manager 2001</game><game id="4715">LMA Manager 2003</game><game id="2237">LMA Manager 2004</game><game id="4805">Soccer Team Manager: English and Italian Leagues</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5589/863704-premier_manager_2000_cover.jpg</image></root>
