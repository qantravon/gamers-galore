As the story goes, Coca-Colacommissioned the game as a gift for executives at a 1983 sales convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Only 125 copies are said to have originally existed. The game was never officially released, so there is no box art (it was presented to the Coke employees in a plain white box).GameplayCoke... wins?The game plays almost identically to the original Space Invaders, with a few notable exceptions. The most obvious difference is that the first five aliens in each row have been replaced with the letters "P", "E", "P", "S", and "I". In addition, each game session is limited to a three minute time span in which players are given an infinite number of lives. Because of this "can't lose" game mechanic, the alien behavior is also changed such that they no longer land at the bottom of the screen (which would normally end the game). And lastly, the flying saucer that appears at the top of the screen in the original game is replaced by the Pepsi logo. When the three minutes are up, the game ends and the words "Coke Wins" flash on the screen.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="14030">Demons to Diamonds</game><game id="15941">Demon Attack</game><game id="23504">Vector Vaders</game><game id="12744">Chicken Invaders</game><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="13424">Cheesy Invaders</game><game id="1293">CHAMP Invaders</game><game id="24605">Alien Invader</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/956012-6a00d83452989a69e200e5505083208834_800wi.jpg</image></root>
