It was originally released on the CPS arcade hardware by Capcom in 1989 and later ported to the Super NES. The game features the same characters as the manga, and their mission is to stop a terrorist group known as Project 4.Carrier Air Wing is the spiritual sequel to U.N. Squadron and was released on the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom in 1990.CharactersThere are three different playable characters in both the arcade version and Super Nintendo version.Shin KazamaThe three playable characters and their planes.Pilots an F-20 Tigershark.

Depending on the stage, the player encounters land, sea and air units. Some red enemies drop a POW, which is used to upgrade the main gun of the players aircraft. The POWs come in green, blue or yellow and each color is worth a different amount of points. Special weapons on the other hand cannot be upgraded.The players aircraft can take some hits before it is destroyed and has a small period of time where it is invulnerable after each hit.TriviaIt's a little known fact that U.N. Squadron was used in the comic strip Computer Warrior, in which a boy called Bobby Patterson found a secret code which let him play computer games 'for real'. The strip to some degree turned into a marketing tool for publisher U.S.Gold, now known as Eidos, as it became solely their published games that were used as the basis of the 'real game playing' story arcs. Other games included Black Tiger and Zak McCracken.As such, the stories and characters from Area 88 may well be the only IP to be a manga adapted to video game, westernized with a new title to then be adapted into a comic book story. Perhaps ironically, the hero from Area 88 was recast as a traitorous villain in the U.N. Squadron Computer Warrior storyline.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21737">Carrier Air Wing</game><game id="20364">Zero Wing</game><game id="11296">Steel Empire</game><game id="29408">Chou Jikuu Yousai Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364687-snes_unsquadron.jpg</image></root>
