Using either a keyboard or a USB controller (such as a PS2-to-USB adapter), players use one hand to hold the frets and the other hand to pick. The game features the ability to rip the official songs from     Guitar Hero,    Guitar Hero II, and   Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, provided you have the disc. Three songs are included with the game, and the game also allows for user-generated tracks (either created with the built-in editor or other freeware editors). Several strong forum communities exist to share such tracks.One of the mods for FoF, modifying the interface to make it resemble Guitar Hero III.There are many mods that can be downloaded from the forums that can change the gameplay (including adding Star Power and refined hammer-on pull-off functionality) or change the overall look to replicate the Guitar Hero or Rock Band series.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20629">Dance Dance Revolution UNIVERSE 3</game><game id="6311">Guitar Hero</game><game id="14916">Guitar Hero II</game><game id="4031">Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</game><game id="22167">Synthesia</game><game id="23849">JamLegend</game><game id="23880">Ultrastar Deluxe</game><game id="20714">Rock Band 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9800/333023-ghmod8.png</image></root>
