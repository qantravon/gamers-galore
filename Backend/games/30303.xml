<root><id>30303</id><name>Mega Man</name><description>OverviewReleased in 1995, Mega Man for the Game Gear was published by U.S. Gold, Ltd. and developed by Capcom. The game is based largely on Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5, although it borrows aspects from other games in the franchise such as Mega Man 2. A few notable differences from other Mega Man games include the fact that there is one Robot Master who does not have a weakness (Wave Man, whose weakness is Charge Man's Charge Kick, which does not appear in this game). Additionally, the small screen size of the Game Gear increases the game's difficulty and also causes an increase in vertical scrolling; an effect that was noted by some critics.The plot of Mega Man is borrowed from Mega Man 4, although the player never fights Dr. Cossack. Rather, the player goes through Wave Man and Toad Man's stages respectively, also fighting the two bosses. After going through those stages, the player goes through Dr. Wily's castle; a single stage which is identical to Quick Man's stage from Mega Man 2.Robot MastersBright ManBright ManModel No.: DWN-025Weapon: Flash StopperWeakness: Star CrashNapalm ManNapalm ManModel No.: DWN-039Weapon: Napalm BombWeakness: Flash StopperStar ManStar ManModel No.: DWN-037Weapon: Star CrashWeakness: Power StoneStone ManStone ManModel No.: DWN-035Weapon: Power StoneWeakness: Napalm BombWave ManWave Man(One of two bosses in Dr. Cossack's fortress)Model No.: DWN-034Weapon: Water WaveWeakness: NoneToad ManToad Man(One of two bosses in Dr. Cossack's fortress)Model No.: DWN-026Weapon: Rain FlushWeakness: Water Wave</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1421808-mega_man__game_gear__coverart.png</image></root>
