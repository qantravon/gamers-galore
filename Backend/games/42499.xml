Running on the new Serious Engine 3.5, Serious Sam 3: BFE serves as a prequel to the original First Encounter; a fact referenced in the games title, BFE standing for Before First Encounter. Set in the 22nd century, the plot revolves around a device known as the "Time-Lock;" a discovery made beneath the ruins of ancient Egypt, found to belong to an even older yet technologically advanced civilization known as the Sirians. However this discovery catches the attention of a dangerous cosmic entity known as Notorious Mental, who assaults Egypt and seizes the Time-Lock as his own, abusing its powers to create a horde of cloned beasts borrowed from various points and places in the universes history to unleash upon the Earth. Various attempts to retake Egypt and reach the Time-Lock have failed, until a new task force is sent in with "Serious" Sam Stone on board, and despite being separated from his team - Sam plows forward with all the weaponry he can find.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17562-1.jpg</image></root>
