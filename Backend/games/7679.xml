<root><id>7679</id><name>Chocobo's Dungeon 2</name><description>The game begins with Chocobo and Mog (the moggle) on a search for treasure in the core of the dungeon.  As the game progresses you'll meet more characters that will accompany you through the dungeons, and  that can be used by the second player. Such as Shiroma(the white mage) and Cid (every FF  or FF related game has one). The game plays out as follows.  You guide Chocobo (and his companions or player 2) into the dungeons, moving from one randomly generated floor to the next, collecting  items, combining weapons and armor , and fighting monsters,  until you have traveled deep enough to reach plot points or boss battles (or both).    </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13105">Baroque</game><game id="4202">Evolution: The World of Sacred Device</game><game id="5276">World of Dragon Warrior: Torneko: The Last Hope</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331085-box_cd2.png</image></root>
