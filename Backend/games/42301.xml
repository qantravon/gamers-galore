More is the name here, more cars and parts to buy giving you every edge to regain your crown. Gameplay is it's most significant thing that you will ever remember in this classic. Gameplay control is really tight.

You're given 3 venues to race your blood thirsty opponent, betting for money and pink slips. The drag race tests how fast you can engage 1st gear.

You're ultimate goal is to beat the new king on these three courses that if you do you get to regain your long lost crown and take home his girl, again.</description><genres><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image /></root>
