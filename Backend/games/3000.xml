<root><id>3000</id><name>Magic: The Gathering</name><description>Magic: The Gathering (and its two expansions) is the first PC version of the incredible popular trading card game. On top of the standard card-game simulation modes that one would expect from such a game, this version also features a unique single-player campaign. The campaign places the player into the role of a wizard in the land of Shandalar, tasked with defeating five arch wizards spread across the land, then ultimately defeating the planeswalker Arzakon. The world of Shandalar is randomly-generated and quite large; players can explore points of interest like ruins, towns, caves, and shipwrecks, find treasures, and hunt down new cards to add to their deck.Aside from the campaign mode, the game also includes more traditional play modes, including a full deck builder.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3483">Yu-Gi-Oh!
