<root><id>1713</id><name>Doom Troopers: Mutant Chronicles</name><description>Doom Troopers is a 1995 action platformer released by Playmates Interactive for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. The game is based on the Mutant Chronicles Doom Trooper collectible card game. The game play is similar to Contra, and features two player co-operative play. Despite the T rating, the game was surprisingly bloody and violent, especially for the time. When enemies and players are killed, limbs and heads are commonly blown off. Like the game Donkey Kong Country, the player and enemy sprites are pre-rendered 3-D.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="1063">Metal Slug 3</game><game id="847">Metal Slug</game><game id="4864">RoboCop</game><game id="9848">NARC</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game><game id="15092">Turrican</game><game id="24538">Weapon of Choice</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363748-snes_mutantchroniclesdoomtroopers.jpg</image></root>
