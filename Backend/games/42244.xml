<root><id>42244</id><name>Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh</name><description>Eons ago, you battered DOH into an intergalactic pulp and escaped. But a scrap of DOH's core energy survived...
And now DOH's hurtling toward you across space and time in the Xorg, a huge spaceship that's crashed into our universe from an unknown dimension.
Use your ultra-fast reflexes and intense concentration to get to the core of the Xorg without pounding your ship to interstellar scrap. Or take a break from battle. Create your own force barriers with the Arkanoid Construction set, the latest in intergalactic dimension-building tools. If you're good enough, youll get through. And come face to face with the force of DOH.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14016-1.jpg</image></root>
