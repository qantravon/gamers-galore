<root><id>2391</id><name>Sonic Jam</name><description>OverviewSonic Jam is a compilation of the first four main entries in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It contains Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and Sonic  Knuckles all on one disc, plus bonus material. Included is a special "Sonic World", which was the first time players got to see and control Sonic the Hedgehog in full 3D. In Sonic World, players can navigate Sonic to various locations around the 3D map to view concept art, character profiles, access a soundtest (containing all the music for every game contained in the collection), or visit a movie theater to watch various Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog game commercials and promotional animations. Additionally, Sonic World contains a number of special "bonus mission" time trials that require you to complete certain tasks in the environment as quickly as possible.Game.com PortTiger's ill-fated Game.Com handheld received a port of the game shortly after the console launched. It featured watered-down versions of Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and Sonic  Knuckles, none of which were actually ported by Sega. The game also does not feature the "Sonic World" section.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17691">Sonic Mega Collection</game><game id="12297">Sonic Mega Collection Plus</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12813/751837-198697_42935_front.jpg</image></root>
