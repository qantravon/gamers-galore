It is a fairly stripped down music program for a techno lover, much like a digital music toy. However, unlike previous games in the series, the interface is actually adapted for consoles.Its simple design involves using a fair selection of samples from different preset music styles along with samples from 10 popular MTV songs/artists, all from 2004 and before, and aligning them into the layers of your new song.The samples are broken up into four distinct categories: Drums, Bass, Riffs, and Vocals. Samples can be tweaked and layered to fit with your arrangements, but the user is still kept within the confines of MTV's basslines and time signatures.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36822">C.P.U.
