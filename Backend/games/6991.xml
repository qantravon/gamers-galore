In 2006, it was released in the US.GameplayPlayers control a wooden ball and have to maneuver through and obstacle course with in a set time. Along the way there are 2 kinds of pick ups to find: One provides an extra ball (life), and one gives extra time. The player's score at the end of the level is based on the time you have left when you finish. The ball can also transform into a rock or crumbled-up newspaper. The rock is heavier, which allows it to easily push boxes out of the way, or tip over bridges. However, because of its weight, it becomes more difficult to get up inclines, and crossing bridges made of planks will break them, dropping the ball into the void. The paper ball has a rougher shape than the wood and rock balls, so it is tougher to control. It is also extremely light, so pushing bridges or boxes is virtually impossible. The main advantage to the paper ball is that it can float up to higher levels when it passes over a fan. Some sections also require the ball to move along two parallel rails, which only the paper ball is light enough to do.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24194">Spectraball</game><game id="8726">Switchball</game><game id="9566">Marble Madness</game><game id="23487">Marble Saga: Kororinpa</game><game id="13585">Kororinpa: Marble Mania</game><game id="8047">Marble Blast Ultra</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33640/1563430-player_2010_10_24_11_27_51_68.jpg</image></root>
