It is a completely different story than the two previous installments in this sequel, with a level range of 3-15.GameplayNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is based on Edition 3.5 of the ADD Rules. New classes include the Swashbuckler as a base class, as well as two new prestige classes: The Doomguide and the Hellfire Warlock.The Swashbuckler is a base class similar to the fighter, but uses dexterity instead of strength, as in the feat, weapon finesse.The Doomguide is a cleric prestige class focusing on turning undead.The Hellfire Warlock is a demonic warlock prestige class that gives the character a flaming visage that works to reflect damage to attackers.The game also introduces two new races: the Gray Orc which is a somewhat less brutish version of the common Orcs, as well as the Yuan-ti Pureblood which is a humanoid creature with reptilian features. The Yuan-ti has been seen in a previous installment of the Neverwinter Nights franchise; a Yuan-ti was one of the four creatures that must be rescued to cure the wailing death in the first game.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="52">Baldur's Gate</game><game id="10637">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</game><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game><game id="5242">Icewind Dale</game><game id="8890">Icewind Dale II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2966/599805-946862_103375_front_1_.jpg</image></root>
