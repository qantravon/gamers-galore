Anderson is partnered up with Diaz who acts as his 'spotter'. He will call out targets in a specific order for the player to shoot.Act 2 takes place in 1993 in Sarajevo, Bosnia. The player is partnered up with Carl Maddox to meet up with a contact and take photographic evidence of genocide taking place for NATO.Act 3 is in 'present day' and the player is reunited with Diaz in Tibet. The pair have to stop Merinov and the bio-weapon threat.Game play is primarily stealth based as getting into open combat with enemies usually leads to the player's demise very quickly.Bullets in the game are affected by distance, gravity and wind speed and direction. As a result on easy and normal difficulties the game has a red circle appear in the scope that indicates where the bullet will hit.In addition to sniping the player can also sneak up on unsuspecting enemies and do a quick instant melee kill with a knife. The player also carries a silenced pistol for close quarters dispatching of enemies. It is not effective when you need to deal with more than one enemy at a time.
