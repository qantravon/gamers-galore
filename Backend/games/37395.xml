<root><id>37395</id><name>Pellet Quest</name><description>Pellet Quest is an open source, Pac-man like role-playing game where the pellets you collected counted as experience points and in game currency.Originally released in February of 2008 the last update to the game was July 2009. The author never completed more than a basic framework for a game. This framework included a mini-map, screens per level, multiple levels, monsters, player damage, lockable doors, traps and experience collecting.In the current version of the game the player is unable to damage enemies, die or venture beyond the 3 included floors. There is also no benefit to leveling other than filling an experience bar.Pellet Quest was programmed using Java and OpenGL and falls under GNU GPL for licensing.At this point it appears this game has been abandoned by its author.ItemsHealing PotionInvulnerability PotionRed keySpeed potionMonstersBatSkeletonsSpiderTree bears?EnvironmentsForest TilesetWater tilesetLava tilesetEnvironment ObjectsBreakable DoorRed doorRegular doorSpike trapTriggered trapFireball shooter</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5855/2119393-pelletquest01.png</image></root>
