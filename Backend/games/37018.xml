Taking on the role of the "Marebito," the game revolves around saving the parallel world of Granbania by restoring power to 12 mystical relics that each correspond to the major western astrological signs before monsters known as "Kegare" overrun it. The crux to accomplishing this, however, lies in developing relationships with 12 maidens specially chosen to oversee the welfare of their respective relics, as they hold the power to create "Star Children" that join the protagonist during dungeon crawling and combat. Featuring development talent that was also responsible for the creation of Spike Chunsoft's Dangan Ronpa franchise, Conception's tone is tongue-in-cheek in nature; the game's various innuendos are regularly used to parody more straight-laced fictional female harem series, with things such as the creation of Star Children implied to not entail actual sexual intercourse.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35653">Ore no Shikabane o Koete Yuke</game><game id="36273">Persona 4 Golden</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2146110-full.jpg</image></root>
