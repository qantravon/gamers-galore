There's also a single-player Pennant Mode which pits the human player against five opponents in a long-term (up to 130 games) pennant season, with the overall highest number of wins deciding the victor.Additionally, there is also a Watch mode that allows the player to simply watch a match play out between two AI opponents.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29193">ESPN Baseball Tonight</game><game id="3894">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2111792-extra_innings.jpg</image></root>
