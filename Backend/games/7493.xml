<root><id>7493</id><name>Close Combat</name><description>Set during the early days of the Normandy invasion (from Omaha Beach to Saint-Lo), Close Combat is a top down, real time strategy game where you control squads and individual guns and vehicles.  The game allows you to issue orders regarding type of movement and targets, but it is up to the soldiers and units to carry out the details, which at times is heavily dependent on their psychology (i.e. whether they are suppressed or broken).  Close Combat, as does its sequels, places a heavy emphasis on historical accuracy and realistic World War II combat.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15315">Close Combat: A Bridge Too Far</game><game id="11018">Close Combat III: The Russian Front</game><game id="142">Close Combat: Invasion - Normandy</game><game id="11591">Close Combat IV: The Battle of the Bulge</game><game id="18067">Alien Earth</game><game id="32124">Achtung Panzer: Kharkov 1943</game><game id="17421">101: The Airborne Invasion of Normandy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/109096/1864987-battle.png</image></root>
