However, power-ups that enemies drop will alter their fire mode in ways such as making them shoot three missiles at a time or shoot in four directions simultaneously. A number in the corner of the screen shows the player's combined lives and fuel, and as the player travels across the screen and hits enemies this number will decrease. If it hits zero the game ends, but this number can be restored by collecting certain pick-ups enemies drop. The game has both a single-player and a co-op mode, and features three levels, each of which end with a boss fight. The game will continually loop through these three levels until the player or players lose all of their fuel/health.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20053">Moon Ranger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/221032-mission_cobra.jpg</image></root>
