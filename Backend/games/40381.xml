The four mini-games are based on: A typical game show set up, where answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon; Othello, where the goal is to surround the other player's pieces; a board-game, where the player moves their piece around the board; a card-based memory game, where the goal is to flip over pairs of matching cards. In each game, the player gets a turn only after they've answered the trivia question correctly.This was Athena's first NES release.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360083-family_quiz_4_nin_wa_rival_fc.jpg</image></root>
