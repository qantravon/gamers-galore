Testing for a period of about 3 weeks at Sherman Oaks Castle Park in California, the game was a reworking of Japan's jubeat Ripples title, with a hefty serving of American licensed songs thrown in for an attempt at appealing to a broader userbase in the US. While the game was fantastic, at the end of the day costs and demand just weren't going to equate to a worthwhile release and Konami was forced to scrap the project.  Songlist Alice Cooper - School's OutBaha Men - Who Let The Dogs OutBasshunter - Now You're GoneBassment Jaxx - Do Your ThingCC Music Factory - Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)Coldplay - Viva La VidaDead Or Alive - You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)Earth, Wind  Fire - SeptemberKelly Clarkson - I Do Not Hook UpLos Del Rio - MacarenaMetro Station - Shake ItOk Go - Here It Goes AgainPanic At The Disco - I Write Sins Not TragediesPhoenix - 1901Pitbull - I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)The Ramones - I Wanna Be SedatedR.E.M. - It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)Technotronic - Pump Up The JamA-Ha - Take On MeDarude - SandstormKi*Ki - Happy HappyMutsuiko Izumi - Orpheus In The UnderworldMutsuhiko Izumi - PolarisMutsuhiko Izumi - Snow GooseSnow - InformerW.T.
