It deals exclusively with US golf courses. As with many of Nintendo's sports games, Mario is featured in the game as Player 1's character. Player 2 is represented by Luigi.Golf: US Course's disk is blue, rather than the usual yellow. Also, like its earlier counterpart Golf: Japan Course, there exists a gold variant that was only given away as a prize in a competition. This special version contains additional courses not found on the original disk and is highly sought after by collectors.</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8885">NES Open Tournament Golf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364875-fds_famicomgolfuscourse_jp.jpg</image></root>
