There are two games called Ys IV that were released in 1993, Mask of the Sun and Dawn of Ys by Hudson. Falcom had no hand in the development of either game except that they came up with the basic plot outline that each developer followed. Although Dawn of Ys is a fan favorite, Mask of the Sun is considered to be the "canonical" fourth entry in the Ys franchise since it was released before Dawn of Ys and was published by Falcom. However, a true Falcom developed Ys IV is currently being developed by for the Playstation Vita under the name Ys: Foliage Ocean in Celceta.Years later Taito Corporation developed a remake of Mask of the Sun called Ys IV: Mask of the Sun - A New Theory for the PS2 in 2005.A patch was released for Ys IV: Mask of the Sun by Aeon Genesis on Feburary 7, 2005 that translated all of the game's text to English.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1354049-ysmasksnesjpfront.jpg</image></root>
