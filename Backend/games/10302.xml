It stays very close to the other Street games in terms of gameplay, but updates the graphics heavily. Homecourt gets its name from its use of real basketball courts from around the United States where current NBA players used to play; the game also tells stories of NBA stars and the local courts they started on before they hit it big. The game contains a very short single player "campaign" that can be beaten in around 6-8 hours and also has very easily obtainable achievements. Homecourt is notable for being the first Xbox 360 game to feature 1080p resolution. GameplayThe previous games have been praised for their depth, and adding modes that are not present in normal basketball games. Homecourt, however, has been criticized for its lack of game modes and low replay value.  Homecourt's game modes are "Pick Up Game", "Homecourt Challenge" (story mode), "Gamebreaker Battle" (only points made during gamebreakers count), "Trick Battle", and "Back to Basics" (no gamebreakers).  GamebreakersIn the previous installments, a gamebreaker could end a game early because players could get all the points necessary to win with one gamebreaker.   In this game however, the maximum amount of points that a single gamebreaker can provide is three (not counting the points earned from the shot itself). As in the previous NBA street games, players earn a gamebreaker by doing skill moves and chaining them together, then scoring a basket to "secure" the gamebreaker points. Story The story is explained through the "Homecourt Challenge" mode. The player starts with a customizable basketball player who has yet to make a name for himself and his town's local basketball court. He plays with various local players and gets noticed by NBA players, joining them in pick-up games and traveling to their own hometown courts. As the player character defeats better teams and advances higher through the hierarchy he is eventually invited to tournaments hosted by some of the best NBA stars. Eventually he hosts and wins his own tournament, putting his hometown on the map and providing a role model for children.  Roster Atlanta Hawks                                         Joe Johnson Strength: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Josh Smith Masterskill: Dunking, Weakness: Steals Speedy Claxton Strength: Passing, Weakness: Dunking Josh Childress Strength: Dunking, Weakness: Passing Boston Celtics                                         Paul Pierce Masterskill: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Sebastian Telfair Strength: Handles, Weakness: Dunking                                         Al Jefferson Strength: Boards/Blocks, Weakness: Shooting Wally Szcerbiak Strength: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks Charlotte Bobcats Emeka Okafor Masterskill: Boards/Blocks, Weakness: Passing                                         Gerald Wallace Strength: Dunking, Weakness: Shooting                                         Adam Morrison Strength: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks Brevin Knight Strength: Passing, Weakness: Dunking Chicago Bulls                                         Ben Wallace Masterskill: Boards/Blocks, Weakness: Steals                                         Kirk Hinrich Strength: Handles, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Ben Gordon Strength: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Luol Deng Strength: Dunking, Weakness: Boards/Blocks Cleveland Cavaliers                                         LeBron James Masterskill: Dunking, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Larry Hughes Masterskill: Steals, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Zydrunas Ilgauskas Strength: Boards/Blocks, Weakness: Shooting Drew Gooden Strength: Dunking, Weakness: Shooting Dallas Mavericks                                         Dirk Nowitzki Masterskill: Shooting, Weakness: Passing                                         Jason Terry Strength: Handles, Weakness: Boards/Blocks Josh Howard Strength: Steals, Weakness: Passing Jerry Stackhouse Strength: Handles, Weakness: Boards/Blocks Denver Nuggets                                         Carmelo Anthony Masterskill: Shooting, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Allen Iverson Masterskill: Handles, Weakness: Boards/Blocks                                         Marcus Camby Strength: Boards/Blocks, Weakness: Shooting J.R.
