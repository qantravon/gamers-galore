<root><id>14354</id><name>Pirate Ship Higemaru</name><description>OverviewPirate Ship Higemaru is a fairly basic maze-like game popular in the Arcades at that time due to the success of Pac-Man. The goal is to use the barrels littered around the stage (which resembles the deck of a galleon) to knock out the pirates swarming around. The pirates don't have any attacks of their own, but coming into contact with one will cost the player a life.Capcom would not port this game to home consoles unlike many of their earlier Arcade games, though they would eventually develop a 1987 sequel - Higemaru Makaijima - for the Famicom and MSX systems.The game would only become available outside of the Arcades in 1998 as part of the Capcom Generations 3 classic arcade compilation. An additional compilation released in 2005 - Capcom Classics Collection - would also mark the first time that the game was available to players in the West, some 21 years after it was first released.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="20589">Bomberman</game><game id="39251">Higemaru Makaijima</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/556885-pirateshiphigemaru_arc_cap_205_5a8a0.png</image></root>
