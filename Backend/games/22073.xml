<root><id>22073</id><name>Fast Food</name><description>OverviewLike Pac-Man and others in the older "maze" genre (such as Jungler or Amidar), Dizzy is placed in a maze and must chase down all the food items to proceed to the next stage. He must also avoid all the ghosts, which appear to be taken directly from Pac-Man, but are instead named Wizza, Pippa, Fido and Bonzo. Similar to Pac-Man, players are treated to small animated vignettes after every three stages, which will also give the player an extra life.Differences from Pac-ManMaze complexity - Many mazes are not symmetrical and the visual theme will change every few levels. They can include dead-ends and "safe zones", which the ghosts cannot enter.Food - The food items Dizzy needs to eat are constantly moving and, like the ghosts, all have their own personalities. One of the dumbest being, of course, the Hamburger.Power-Ups - Dizzy can also collect various power-ups that wander around in much the same way the food and ghosts do. They confer both helpful and not-so-helpful temporary abilities on Dizzy and the other moving elements.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="21711">Gotcha</game><game id="4702">BurgerTime</game><game id="19552">Pac-Man: Championship Edition</game><game id="6332">Ms. Pac-Man</game><game id="1010">Jr. Pac-Man</game><game id="12338">Pac-Man Vs.</game><game id="22386">Pac-Man Plus</game><game id="861">Pac-Mania</game><game id="2276">Mouse Trap</game><game id="1739">Lock 'n' Chase</game><game id="18684">Wizard of Wor</game><game id="23314">Baby Pac-Man</game><game id="23313">Pac &amp; Pal</game><game id="15304">Oh Shit!</game><game id="24311">Bounce Out</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game><game id="41202">Onyanko Town</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1924/293759-256px_dizzy_fastfood_game_cover.jpg</image></root>
