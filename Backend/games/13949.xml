Sadly, the game also lacked in quality, another thing that differed greatly from the original game. Instead of a television station, the player is in charge of a news magazine and must turn it from a run down paper into a big and successful newspaper empire.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17711">Mad TV</game><game id="15967">Mad TV 2</game><game id="11601">Biing!: Sex, Intrigue and Scalpels</game><game id="2649">Biing! 2: Sonne, Strand und Heisse NÃ¤chte</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/2108009-936914_82299_front.jpg</image></root>
