<root><id>36949</id><name>Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</name><description>OverviewA werewolf has entered the realm of the Kingdom and wreaking havoc everywhere. The king is summoning heroes to deal with this problem. But the problem grows bigger as the werewolf is part of a host of ancient foes trying to conquer the land. You have to stop the invasion during 8 missions in the single player campaign.Although Defenders of Ardania includes a single-player portion, the focus of the game is multiplayer, where two to four players can take each other on or compete against AI opponents via Internet, LAN or PSN. The multiplayer component offers three different game modes where players can assume either the defensive or offensive sides –or both. You can summon your heroes to the offence and conquer the opponents' towers. This is a new twist to the original gameplay.The player can defend his territory with the help of 24 up-gradable towers, and can order up to 24 different units to attack the other side.The game is available for both the PC as the Playstation 3 and is only available as a digital download.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7Processor: 2.0GHz dual core processorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce 6800 GTX 512MB or better, Pixel Shader 2.0DirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 4 GB freeSound: DirectX-compatibleAdditional:Internet connection or LAN required for multiplayer</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="4820">Dungeon Keeper 2</game><game id="32175">Dungeon Keeper 3</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="2815">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="9828">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire – The Eastern Realm</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="15960">Evil Genius</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331132-box_mj2boa.png</image></root>
