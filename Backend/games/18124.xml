Doing so opens up several different minigames: cookie (and worm) catching, racing, and puzzle solving are featured in the gamut.Contrary to advertisement of "hours and hours" of gameplay, Rugrats: I Gotta Go Party can probably be beaten in less than an hour.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8169/758615-582264_44091_front.jpg</image></root>
