There are plenty of direct comparison points between the two games, such as general art style, the presence of torn-up buildings that enemies sometimes jump from, enemy death animations, and so on.Since the Commodore 64 only has one joystick button, grenades are tossed by holding down the fire buttom for a brief period of time. Capcom's own port of Commando to the C64 got around this limitation by forcing the player to press the space bar to throw grenades.Some other versions (ike the MSX release, for example) were played in a fixed-screen format rather than its usual scrolling style.WDW2--on the C64, anyway--contains eight levels.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6850">Commando</game><game id="14750">Airborne Ranger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/624733-who_dares_wins_ii_uk_box_art.jpg</image></root>
