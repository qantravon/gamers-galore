Keeping the team of eight alive is another priority and the player can hinder their opponent by tackling and generally causing as much pain to the other team as possible. The rules were a mash-up of many real-life sports and included the tackling of Rugby, the goalkeeping of Ice Hockey and the scoring system of Basketball.During a match, players could use special moves, bombs, chainsaws and guns to inflict additional damage on their opponents. It is possible for a player to be permanently killed off during a match.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13768">Speedball</game><game id="25200">Blood Bowl</game><game id="16269">Chaos League</game><game id="13548">Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331090-box_dbz.png</image></root>
