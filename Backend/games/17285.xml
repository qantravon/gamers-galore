<root><id>17285</id><name>Anvil of Dawn</name><description>OverviewAfter waking up in a dungeon, the game quickly sets the tone and pace of the story by familiarizing you with the basic premise of the story. A kingdom in peril and an evil warlord that goes postal. The game lets you pick from various classes (including one  lizard) and magic schools. Over the course of the game the character has more opportunities to be  customized as well as equipping himself with all sorts of  loot and weapons. The  dungeon crawler follows the traditional formula, mixing combat and  pixelhunting  puzzles, as well as an  Auto-Map feature.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16507">Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</game><game id="12917">Dragon Lore: The Legend Begins</game><game id="5980">Might and Magic: World of Xeen</game><game id="4398">Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor</game><game id="17886">Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven</game><game id="3239">Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer</game><game id="9734">Heroes of Might and Magic V: Hammers of Fate</game><game id="8432">Heroes of Might and Magic IV: Winds of War</game><game id="7885">Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny</game><game id="8033">Lands of Lore III</game><game id="1200">Abandoned Places: A Time for Heroes</game><game id="7813">Abandoned Places 2</game><game id="6578">Legend of Faerghail</game><game id="18518">Dungeon Master</game><game id="15771">Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep</game><game id="5370">Dungeon Hack</game><game id="25105">Drakensang: The Dark Eye</game><game id="19501">Ishar: Legend of the Fortress</game><game id="20068">Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom</game><game id="7426">Ishar 3: The Seven Gates of Infinity</game><game id="1388">Bloodwych</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/635679-7023_boxshot_anvil_20of_20dawn_1_.jpg</image></root>
