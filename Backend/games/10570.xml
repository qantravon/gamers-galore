Developed by Core, it was originally released in November 1999 for the Sony PlayStation and PC, although it subsequently saw releases for the Dreamcast and the Macintosh in March and December of 2000 respectively. The beginning of the game featured a 16 year old Lara adventuring in Cambodia with her mentor, Werner Von Croy. Infamously, this is the game that killed off Lara in the original series, with her being buried in a tomb. The following game, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, was a look at some of her past, lesser known adventures.CharactersLara CroftTomb Raider and adventurer.Werner Von CroyLara's former Mentor.

These short 'tutorial' levels, designed to help the player get to grips with the game, are set in Cambodia.CambodiaAngkor WatEgyptValley of The KingsKarnakAlexandriaCairoGizaPC RequirementsWindows 95/98/ME/XP (Home Edition)Pentium 233 (Min.), Pentium 266 (Rec.)4x CD-ROM Drive16MB RAM (Min.), 32MB (Rec.)DirectX 6.1 compatible 3D graphics card (Min.)DirectX 6.1 compatible sound card</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16589">The Mummy Returns</game><game id="13288">Barbie Explorer</game><game id="5151">Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1810977-box_traidertlr.png</image></root>
