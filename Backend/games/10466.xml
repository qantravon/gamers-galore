Not just for kicks, of course.  The primary objective in 1942 is to reach      Tokyo in order to destroy     Japan's remaining air force. The game featured an    evade maneuver, allowing the plane to roll out of the way of incoming fire.  There was also a two-player mode, but the series didn't start out with cooperative play. Instead, players would trade off and achieve their own designated scores. While traversing the Pacific Theater, Super Ace would fly through eight locations split between thirty-two stages, four stages in each.  All of the stages are set in true-to-life locations including Midway, Marshall, Attu, Rabaul, Levte, Saiban,   Iwo Jima, and  Okinawa.1942 would go on to become Capcom's first franchise, releasing sequels, spin-offs, and even a prequel.  1942 has solidified itself in gaming history, released in several Capcom "greatest hits" collections including             Capcom Generations,             Capcom Classics Collection, and             Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15361">Gun.Smoke</game><game id="13536">The Guardian Legend</game><game id="16253">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</game><game id="21484">3D Mania</game><game id="2032">Aero Fighters</game><game id="19210">Aero Fighters 2</game><game id="9871">Aero Fighters 3</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="1554">Aerostar</game><game id="7970">Banshee</game><game id="6813">Sky Shark</game><game id="14539">Astro Warrior</game><game id="23343">Exed Exes</game><game id="23341">Eco Fighters</game><game id="23424">Vapor Trail</game><game id="22712">Giga Wing</game><game id="9833">Tiger-Heli</game><game id="24002">Raiden IV</game><game id="998">Gemini Wing</game><game id="21880">Twin Hawk</game><game id="30347">Raiden Trad</game><game id="29724">Finalizer - Super Transformation</game><game id="28120">Söldner-X 2: Final Prototype</game><game id="38175">Flying Shark</game><game id="14962">P-47 Thunderbolt: The Freedom Fighter</game><game id="9083">Screaming Wings</game><game id="2551">D-Force</game><game id="42643">TUG</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361100-nes_1942.jpg</image></root>
