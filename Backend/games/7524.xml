Call of Duty 3 featured class based multiplayer. The game modes are Battle, Team Battle, War, Capture-the-Flag (CTF), Single CTF, and Headquarters. Battle is your traditional death match, Team Battle is basically Team death match, War is when there are flags all over a map and you must take control of each flag before going onto the next flag, capture the flag is when you basically try to capture the enemies' flag and bring it to your own base. Single Capture the flag is the flag spawning at the center of the match and you must take the flag to the enemy's base. Headquarters is when a radio spawns randomly at a map and the team who captures the radio makes a base there and protects the base, the opposite team has to try to take down the base, you get 1 point for every second you hold the base, usually the first with 300 points wins the match. All of the Single Player maps were available in multiplayer, through one form or another. There were also vehicles including tanks, cars, and motorcycles, which was a new feature for a Call of Duty game in multiplayer.ClassesScout - Armed with a sniper rifle and pistol; able to call in artillery strikes on enemy positions when enough time has passed.Rifleman - Armed with a rifle, a pistol, and able to mount grenades onto the gun muzzle.Light Assault - Armed with a submachine gun, a pistol, grenades; able to plant mines.Heavy Assault - Armed with an assault rifle, a pistol, and grenades; able to plant mines.Support - Armed with a light machine gun and pistol; able to drop ammunition packs for themselves and other players.Medic - Armed with a trench gun and a smoke grenade; able to heal fallen teammates needed to charge up after each use.Anti-Tank - Armed with a bazooka, a pistol; able to drop ammunition packs for themselves and other players.The game has been quite heavily edited to pass verification in Germany. As such, there are no swatikas or Schutzstaffel symbols in the game. The team select menu does not contain the word Nazi either. Instead, it allows you to select between Axis and Allies. The symbol used for the Axis is the Nazi war flag, which contains the iron cross, but no swastika.Game DevelopmentCall of Duty 3 was Treyarch's first Call of Duty game.
