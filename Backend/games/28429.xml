Choosing male or female does not effect the base starting values. After selecting your race you are given an amount of bonus points that you are free to assign however you want. The different classes have specific minimum requirements before they are available to create (both alignment and stat). If you do not get enough bonus points to create the class you want you are free to keep re-rolling until you get enough.Races of Wizardry LoLs:RaceStrIntPieVitAgiLucHuman888989Elf71010789Dwarf116101167Gnome51411559Porklu66561214Classes and Class Requirements:ClassAlignmentStrIntPieVitAgiLucFighterAny12N/AN/AN/AN/AN/AMageAnyN/A12N/AN/AN/AN/APriestGood, EvilN/AN/A12N/AN/AN/AThiefNeutral, EvilN/AN/AN/AN/A1012BishopGood, EvilN/A1313N/AN/AN/ASamuraiGood, Neutral15111014109LordGood151212151415NinjaEvil151515151515</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25134">Class of Heroes</game><game id="14350">Etrian Odyssey</game><game id="20511">Etrian Odyssey II: Heroes of Lagaard</game><game id="29469">Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City</game><game id="24865">The Dark Spire</game><game id="22770">Bard's Tale</game><game id="36231">Legend of Grimrock</game><game id="33763">Elminage Original</game><game id="40624">Elminage Gothic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/90021/1843745-wizardrylogo.jpg</image></root>
