Most tables can be tipped over to create cover, toilets flush and faucets spill water. You can also drag big items like rickshaws, desks, beds and dumpsters, and small items like chairs, baskets, pots  pans, can be picked up and thrown.A rudimentary cover mechanic is integrated into game play. Although cover is usually unnecessary, an overturned table or desk proved useful in some fights in nothing more as something to do to confound the passable enemy AI. Playing at higher difficulty levels shows off an adequate AI system often missed on lower levels where enemies act far more realistically in cover.Items looted from enemies and the environment can be combined metal shards, wire cutters, alarm clocks, rags, glue, motion sensor and plastique to create improved weapons (bombs, grenades, traps).The game offers what it calls 'Zone specific' rag-doll death  body damage effects which amounts of blood splatter  drip effects, limbs spawn when blown off, player drips blood when critically hit. The ragdoll is satisfying, but primitive with many enemies falling without flourish but sometimes cart wheeling away a bit too limply.Health is distributed through a syringe of adrenaline you carry with you at all times. It can be used at any time, but must be strategically employed since it requires a seven second animation that if interrupted by the player or enemies must be restarted.An after mission ranking system was included in the game. Rank was based on how many secondary objectives , shooting accuracy, the percentage of enemies killed, number of weapons found, the number of combinable items found, and the number of intelligence items found. Much of this system was unexplained in the game and manual so they system was very controversial since it seem arbitrary and harsh without explanation of how to improve.Voice ActorsThe shadowy anatomist of John Grey was voiced by British character actor Tom Baker, best known as the fourth incarnation of The Doctor, in Doctor Who.
