His father finds him reading a magic book in bed and in anger throws the book on the chalkboard pentagram the floor. This causes the book to catch alight and summons Sordid, who now seeks revenge on   Simon the Sorcerer. Sordid promises Runt that he can become his apprentice if he helps him capture Simon.Meanwhile, Simon lives happily in his own world and completely unaware of Sordid's return. Sordid sends a wardrobe to trick Simon back to the magical world, but Sordid mistakenly made the wardrobe bring Simon to the doorstep of Calypso's Magic Shop, the wizard who Simon rescued in the first game.   Calypso tells Simon that in order to return home he must find the wardrobe's power source called Mucusade.GameplayThe gameplay is very similar to the first game, continuing to use a  point-and-click interface. The only difference is that there are now icons instead of words that you click to carry out actions. For example, the first game had a 'talk to' button, but it has been replaced to an icon of a mouth.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3019">The Secret of Monkey Island</game><game id="11734">Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!</game><game id="17544">Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars</game><game id="7947">Lure of the Temptress</game><game id="6728">Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</game><game id="295">The Legend of Kyrandia</game><game id="31451">The Book of Unwritten Tales</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4938/609058-verpackung24.jpg</image></root>
