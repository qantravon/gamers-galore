They work together in various anime like Chobits (Shinbo and Chii), Tokko (Ranmaru Shindo and Ryoko Ibuki), Gungrave (Harry McDowell and Maria Asagi), and Brigadoon: Marin and Melan (Melan and Moe). This is the first video game they got into together; the second one is in BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger as   Bang Shishigami and  Carl Clover.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</game><game id="18082">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</game><game id="12564">Inuyasha: The Secret of the Cursed Mask</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2421660-box_lt3totsk.png</image></root>
