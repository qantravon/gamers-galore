The gameplay consists of making plot choices and seeing where they lead. Often the more vulgar the choice, the more chances you have to restart the scene. The game follows a man, presumably the titular plumber, and a woman looking for a job, as romantic hijinx ensue between them.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23944">Sex</game><game id="35134">Dennis Miller: That's News to Me</game><game id="14393">Town With No Name</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8582/295208-pdwt.jpg</image></root>
