Movement is restricted to set points or bases on the map. Which limits movement actions to either attack and enemy base or support a base being attacked. There is only one type of unit and these are used to attack and defend these bases. It starts out with one unit being able to kill one other unit, but in the process that unit will also die. The units attack power and defense can later be upgraded through various means. These means are achieved through two primary means: first through base upgrades and second through having high morale. This will play heavily in defeating opponents in later fights.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30020">Galcon Fusion</game><game id="37334">Oil Rush</game><game id="39117">Planets Under Attack</game><game id="21673">Galactic Conquest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23546/1178178-mw.jpg</image></root>
