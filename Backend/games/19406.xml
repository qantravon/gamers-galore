The sheriff is confronted with several different scenarios with which there are four possible responses. The outcome of the game changes depending on the choices made.While most of the game involves choosing which response to use, there are instances where the player can shoot a villainous character when they pop in the background, as well as ruthlessly gunning down the people they are talking to. However, it's often better in the long run to befriend the various NPCs that are met (or at least leave the encounter on good terms).</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="41453">Westerado</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1230291-lawwest.jpg</image></root>
