Then arrived the PlayStation 3 and Sony obviously saw the opportunity to capitalize in a similar manner. It comes in the form of a downloadable game by the name of Nucleus – an 80’s style-shooter that sees you fighting your way through the human body on a mission to rid it of a deadly virus. However, the game doesn’t follow the conventional methods that Geometry Wars did, instead it ditches both pace and simplicity in favor of a unique and extremely challenging experience that will test the skills and the patience of even the most hardened of gamers.You take control of what can only be described as a sperm-like jellyfish that has three core abilities. It can fire plasma shots, use a tractor beam, and boost or ‘squirt’ (as the game calls it) around the screen. You must take advantage of these abilities in order to kill the hoardes of bacteria that infect the screen. In addition to this each level is filled with cells, these are essentially green blobs that float around randomly, these can be dragged together to form walls or alternatively shot to release protein. Collect enough of these and you’ll earn yourself a protein bomb; this is the most powerful weapon at your disposal and if used right can be the difference between passing and failing one of the 40 plus levels the game has to offer.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20600">Blast Factor</game><game id="22478">PowerUp Forever</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1205008-nucleus.png</image></root>
