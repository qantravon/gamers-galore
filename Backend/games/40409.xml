The player selects commands from a menu in order to talk to NPCs and solve puzzles which will eventually allow them to progress. As with many of these Famicom text adventures there is a linear critical path that the player must follow in order to move to new areas and reach the next point of the story.Nankin refers to a semi-obscure manga artist of the same name who was behind much of the art design of the game. Though the game doesn't include any of his pre-existing licenses, his distinctive art style is present throughout. This approach might be equated to Akira Toriyama's artistic involvement with the Dragon Quest and Chrono games.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17444">Hoshi wo Sagashite...</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="4555">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360935-nankin_no_adventure_fds.jpg</image></root>
