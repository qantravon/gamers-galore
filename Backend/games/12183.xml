<root><id>12183</id><name>Walker</name><description>The Game is controlled using both keyboard or joystick for movement and the mouse for shooting. Movement is only left and right, and your walker can't turn around or aim behind itself, it scrolled right to left and there's no scrolling back. Similar to the developers more successful franchise Lemmings, the game has tiny characters with many intricate animations. It was extremely difficult on anything other than the easiest difficulty setting where enemies would approach from angles.The game was made even more frustrating by the gun constantly overheating if you fired it constantly for too long.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2628/1140909-walker_01.jpg</image></root>
