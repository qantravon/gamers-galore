<root><id>22838</id><name>SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics</name><description>OverviewSWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics is based on an obscure manga by cartoonist Oki Hajime that focuses on five police officers working in a SWAT team and plays like a tactical turn-based RPG such as Dragon Quest, though far more involved and slower paced. In combat each member of the four person team chooses a target and one of their weapons to attack them with and the game plays out the battle turn by turn. The terrorists the player encounters in the otherwise nondescript office building the game takes place in can be wounded and interrogated for more information, or simply killed.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1537799-swat_front.jpg</image></root>
