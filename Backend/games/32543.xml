<root><id>32543</id><name>Epic Citadel</name><description>In Epic Citadel, players navigate a fictional castle realm using dual analog stick style touch controls. It’s all about exploring the world, from the circus bazaar to the bridge overlooking the river to the mysterious cathedral at the center of town.   There are no set objectives, this is a tech demo designed to show the power of Unreal Engine 3 on Apple's later iOS devices.   It features advanced graphical effects such as, bump offset mapping, texture blending with painted weight maps, global illumination, dynamic specular lighting with texture masks, and real time reflection and vertex deformation.  In layman's terms, it looks bad ass.  It is compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod touch (3rd generation), iPod touch (4th generation), and iPad. </description><genres /><similar_games><game id="32526">Infinity Blade</game><game id="36621">Infinity Blade II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7734/1497777-epic_citadel_logo.png</image></root>
