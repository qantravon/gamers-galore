Our protagonist has found that with school over, the oppressive challenge of joblessness is bearing down and crushing all joy in their life! But will you give up? HOPEFULLY NOT! Equip your resume and DO BATTLE with your doubts and fears! Show that you have what it takes to survive in the face of UNCERTAIN FUTURE! This game is not so much a traditional RPG as much as it is an allegory for personal experiences. It is in no way an epic quest as much as it is an exploration of experiences through the tropes and cliches of an RPG.</description><genres><genre>Role-Playing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17905-1.jpg</image></root>
