It is one of the earliest third-party games for the system that wasn't a conversion of a pre-existing Arcade game or computer game. Though the game is credited to a developed named "Wixel" on its title screen, it's commonly believed that developers-for-hire Micronics were responsible for the game's design. ASCII Entertainment, a prominent producer of Japanese computer games, published the game.As a shooter, it uses the then-popular Z-axis "pseudo-3D" perspective with which Sega would find later great success in the Arcades with hits like Space Harrier and After Burner. It also uses a feature pioneered in Xevious, in which the player has access to two weapons: One that destroys ground targets and another that destroys air targets. The player needs to use the right weapon to take out incoming enemies.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6036">Space Harrier</game><game id="11700">Exerion</game><game id="39611">Falsion</game><game id="3629">After Burner</game><game id="1487">Xevious</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2414218-geimos_fc.jpg</image></root>
