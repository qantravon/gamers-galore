The second question is "Which character would you least likely like to play as?" with the choices of Stewie's sister, Peter's daughter, Meg, or Chris' sister.ShutdownThe game was permanently shut down on January 18, 2013.</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2183808-fgo.png</image></root>
