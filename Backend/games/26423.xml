<root><id>26423</id><name>Call of Duty: Black Ops</name><description>OverviewWelcome to the jungle.Call of Duty: Black Ops is a first-person shooter developed by Treyarch and published by Activision (published by Square Enix in Japan). The seventh installment of the Call of Duty series, the campaign is set during the early era of the Cold War, as players control members of the United States black operations unit known as the SOG (Studies and Observations Group). The game was released on November 9, 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and Wii, with a Nintendo DS version developed by n-Space. A Mac version is coming during the fall of 2012.Multiplayer retains the experience point system put in place in Call of Duty games since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. However, along with removing some restrictions with level unlockables, Call of Duty: Black Ops adds a currency system that is earned during gameplay and is used to buy most accessories. The game also introduces customizable face paints, fully-customizable emblems, character models that depend on which of the first Perk to use (instead of weaponry), "Contracts" (which allow players to earn money and experience by achieving certain goals in a specific amount of time), customizable game modes (along with a File Share system similar to Halo: Reach to store custom game modes), split-screen support in online multiplayer, automatic replay saving (which can be watched, alone or with others, in the Theater Mode), "Wager Matches" (which allow players to gamble their money in one of four special six-player free-for-all game modes), and "Combat Training" (which allows players to practice against AI opponents).Zombies from Call of Duty: World at War makes a return with two distinct scenarios (one of which must be unlocked by completing the game). A third scenario was added with the "First Strike" DLC add-on. Accessing a secret terminal from the main menu allows players to play either a special deliberately-retro twin-stick shooter known as "Dead Ops Arcade" or Zork I: The Great Underground Empire.A fourth new scenario was introduced with the second "Escalation" Map pack, called Call Of The Dead, which is a tribute to horror movies, with an all-star cast, allowing players to take control of Danny Trejo, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Englund and Michael Rooker, with legendary horror movie writer George Romero as a boss zombie.The zombie storyline continued with the introduction of the "Annihilation" Map pack, introducing the map "Shangri-La". it follows the Four original characters into a resort-like map, filled with multiple traps and narrow corners. this map introduces female zombies, a new Wonder Weapon called the 31-79 JGb215, monkeys that drop a power up in a roulette-like manner, and a special means of obtaining all the perks.The final Zombie experience added was the " Moon" map from the "Rezurrection" DLC. this map takes place on a colony on the moon, with all the characters in space suits. the level takes into account the moon's gravity, affecting movement of both the zombies and the players, as well as featuring a new wonder weapon named the Wave/Zap Gun, which causes zombies to swell up and explode. the map also features, for the first time in the series, a survival like area of the map where there are no rounds, but infinitely spawning zombies and hellhounds.Those who Purchased the "Hardened" and"Prestige" versions of Black Ops were allowed access to play the zombie maps of World At War, which were eventually made available to the public through the "Rezurrection" map pack. those who bought the Hardened or Prestige editions received the aforementioned map pack for free.StoryThe plot is based during the Cold War and spans many locations and conflicts through different periods of time. You play most of the game as Alex Mason, an American black ops specialist. The majority of missions take place as memories while Mason hallucinates random sequences of numbers being all around him. As he tries to recollect his memories and understand what's happening to him (with the assistance of the interrogators), the player goes through a variety of missions that led up to Mason's current state.The Vietnam War.The game starts off with Mason waking up in an interrogation room, strapped to a chair that electrocutes him. In front of him are multiple screens and a man with a deep voice asks him questions that Mason can't seem to answer. Mason keeps seeing weird numbers and the voice wants to know what these numbers mean. After resisting, Mason decides to co-operate. The voice wishes to know where things started off, during the battle of the Bay of Pigs. This real life operation occurred in the 60s where the CIA trained Cuban insurgents to take down Castro. The scene starts with Mason in a bar with special ops Bowman and Woods. Things go bad real quick when the cops arrive and the group has to flee. Mason drives his car into a police barrage and the game suddenly flashes white and teleports the player several hours later with Mason about to attack Castro's palace along with Cuban insurgents. After a lot of shooting, Mason assassinates Castro and his prostitute. The squad make a run for their plane but while it's taxiing to take off, the Cubans block off the run way. Mason decides to sacrifice himself by jumping off the plane, taking control of an AA gun and blowing up the roadblock. The squad gets away but Mason is captured.Alex wakes up face to face with Castro. What he killed was a doppelganger. There was a leak in the intel and Castro knew the Americans were coming. Castro is working with a Russian called Dragovich. Castro gives Mason to Dragovich who sends him to Vorkuta, a mining gulag in Siberia. There Alex meets Reznov who becomes his only friend. Together they plan to break out of the gulag through a 5 phase revolution. They succeed but are gassed by the Soviets. Reznov helps Mason get up and both get on motorcycles and in a call back to "The Great Escape" ride them out of the gulag. Alex manages to make it and jump on a train but Reznov is caught. Mason makes it back to the USA and meets with Secretary McNamara who leads him to the Pentagon and President Kennedy, who gives him a top secret mission to assassinate Dragovich. During this scene, numbers play in Mason's head and he has weird hallucinations including one where he pulls a gun on the president. Despite all this, Mason makes his way to a launch site in Russia where Dragovich is said to be. There he meets Woods and together they sabotage the launch site and go after Dragovich who apparently dies in a car crash.Weaver ready for the assault.Several years pass and Mason begins to obsess over Dragovich, believing that he's still alive. Mason is sent to Vietnam to locate an informant who has intel about Soviet activity in the region. There Mason reunites with Woods and Bowman and together they go on a killing spree through Vietnam and meet the informant, who's in fact Reznov. Reznov reveals that Dragovich is in fact still alive and so is his right hand man. Dragovich is creating a super bio-weapon that goes by the name of Nova 6. Reznov also explains how he ended up in the gulag in the first place. Right after the second world war, the Soviet army was conducting operations to eradicate the last of the Nazis that were still posted in Siberia. A Nazi Scientist by the name of Steiner had decided to co-operate with the Soviets by giving them an extremely powerful Bio-weapon that would give them the upper hand on the Americans. After fighting through the last of the Nazis, Steiner brings the Soviets to a wrecked ship frozen in ice. There they find Nova 6 and Dragovich decides to test it on his own soldiers. Disgusted, Reznov rebels and is left for dead as the two evil generals escape. Reznov places charges in the boat, blowing it up and escapes.Back in the 60s, agent Hudson is following a lead in Hong-Kong. The informant is about to reveal what the numbers are about but is killed. The informant tells Hudson and his squad about a mountain base where Steiner can be found. Steiner is not there but the numbers and the main cities where the bio-weapon will be released. Steiner tells Hudson (via intercom) that Dragovich is eliminating anyone he doesn't need anymore. Fearing for his life, he wants Hudson and his squad come and get him at Rebirth Island.The SOG get close air support.Mason and Reznov track Steiner to Rebirth Island, where they fight their way to him. When they find him, Reznov is about to finish Steiner off when two men with Hazmat suits break in. At this point, the interrogator yells at Mason, telling him that Mason himself killed Steiner and not Reznov. The game rewinds 20 minutes and the player experiences the situation from Hudson's point of view, who was one of the men who crashed through the window. It is revealed that Mason did in fact pull the gun on Steiner, not Reznov. It is also revealed that Reznov died in the prison break, and that every appearance he made after that mission was part of Mason's imagination. When Mason was in Vorkuta, he was brainwashed by his captors who programmed him to kill President John F. Kennedy. However, Reznov sabotaged the operation and changed the programming so that Mason would want to kill the three men that brainwashed him, thus explaining his actions during the game.Hudson and Weaver reveal themselves to be the interrogators. Hudson frees Mason from his shackles but Mason immediately knocks him out with a punch. Mason stumbles around the building in a trance for a bit before being stopped by Hudson. At this point, Dragovich starts the first broadcast to his sleeper agents around the United States, which Mason hears and interprets. The signal is coming from a ship called the Rusalka. Hudson, Mason, and a large contingency of soldiers attack the ship. After some intense fighting, Mason chokes Dragovich to death, and they destroy the ship.After the game is finished, real footage of President Kennedy's fatal ride with his motorcade plays. At the end of the presentation, the video pauses and zooms in on a crowd that Kennedy was greeting. There we see Mason, suggesting that he was involved in the assassination of the President.GameplayThe game offers gameplay elements that are new to Call of Duty games, such as piloting a helicopter and flying a jet. The game also offers weapons that were popular at the time and then some. The developers have explained that the soldiers that were part of Black Ops got to use prototype weapons and weapons that would appear on the battlefield years later. This is why the game lets you play with shotguns that have incendiary ammo ("Dragon's Breath") and crossbows with explosives tips. Like in other Call of Duty games, Black Ops relies on big set pieces, including one where your helicopter is shot down while you're rappelling down from it.Black Ops has a competitive multiplayer mode, as well as a cooperative "Nazi Zombies" mode.Single Player Specific WeaponsThe single player campaign contains all of the multiplayer weapons plus a few extras:Submachine GunsMP40PPSh-41StenAssault RiflesSTG-44ShotgunsKS-23Model 1887Sniper RiflesMosin-NagantPistolsTokarevLaunchersPanzerschreckMultiplayer WeaponsPrimary -

Unlike previous Call of Duty games, where standard perks can only be unlocked by reaching certain levels, all standard perks are available from the start. However, these perks must be bought using the in-game currency. Unlike Modern Warfare 2, where Pro perks can only be unlocked by completing the same challenge multiple times, Call of Duty: Black Ops requires players to complete three unique challenges in order to be able to buy Pro perks (sometimes requiring the player to play multiple game modes). Each player character's attire is now determined by which "Perk 1" perk they choose, rather than their chosen primary weapon. Like Modern Warfare 2, Pro perks add their bonuses to the standard perks. Pro versions, once unlocked, cost 3000 COD points to convert the perk into the Pro version.Perk 1 (Blue Perks)NameDescriptionPro Unlock ChallengesCostIconLightweight7% faster sprint speed.Pro Version: no fall damage.Escape death (from being shot an enemy) 5 times using the Lightweight perk.Kill 15 enemies using melee with the Lightweight perk.Get 10 Offense Medals using the Lightweight perk (by killing enemies while near their objective).FreeScavengerReplenish ammo and lethal throwables from fallen enemies.Pro Version: Replenish tactical throwables.

Rewards are split up and given to the top three players of the match. The four Wager Mode game modes have no class selection, putting each player in an equal playing field.One in the ChamberPlayers start with a pistol (with one bullet and the ability to instant kill), a knife, and three lives only. Players receive points and another bullet after each kill. Players who are not eliminated also receive points after another player is eliminated. Once a match is down to two players, both players have their Spy Planes active at all times. The match ends when one player remains. The player with the most points wins the match.Sticks and StonesPlayers start with a Crossbow (with four explosive tip arrows), two Ballistic Knives, and a Tomahawk. Players must kill each other to score points. (Though knifing people will give players 1/4 of the kill points and killing people with the tomahawk gives players 1/10 of the kill points) Killing an enemy with a Tomahawk resets that enemy's score down to zero. Committing suicide resets the player's score down to zero. All players have their Spy Planes active at all times. The player with the most points after five minutes wins the match.Gun GameBased on a popular game modification for Counter-Strike: Source, Gun Game requires players to upgrade their "Weapon Tier" by killing enemies with their current weapon (which has infinite ammo). Killing players with that weapon upgrades the killer's Weapon Tier and replaces his weapon with the next one (unless the death occurs while the killer is dead, in which the killer's Weapon Tier does not upgrade). Killing a player with a knife lowers their Weapon Tier. Committing suicide, however, lowers the player's Weapon Tier, replacing his weapon with the previous one. The first player to kill with a Ballistic Knife wins the match.Python (with Speed Reloader)Makarov (with Dual Wield)SPAS-12StakeoutMP5KSkorpion (with Dual Wield)AK74uM14M16FamasAUGHK21M60L96A1WA2000RPG-7 (formerly Grim Reaper, which is still used in some versions)M72 LAWChina LakeCrossbow (with Explosive Tip)Ballistic KnifeSharpshooterEvery player carries the same weapon (with infinite ammo), which randomly cycles every 45 seconds.

There will only be one server provider, Game Servers, who are offering ranked and unranked servers. Those who choose to rent a server will have full control over it, from admin powers such as being able to kick and ban players, to choosing which map and game modes will be played. Also to clarify, Treyarch has said that "no one will need to purchase a server to play", meaning that those who decide to play the PC version will have plenty of free servers to play on provided by Treyarch.SP Campaign LevelsOperation 40VorkutaU.S.D.D.Executive OrderS.O.G.The DefectorNumbersProject NovaVictor CharlieCrash SiteWMDPaybackRebirthRevelationsRedemptionBugs  GlitchesThe game launched with some multiplayer glitches, which prompted Treyarch to warn players against exploiting these glitches and threatening permanent bans against any cheaters.PC and Console GlitchesPlay in Third Person mode - There is a glitch, on some game settings, that if you were viewing in third person waiting to respawn (or join), and there is a host migration, you will start the match in third person. it operates in the same manner as the mode in Modern Warfare 2, but without crosshairs, or zooming in while aiming.Zoo - Outside of Map - it is possible, through a knifing glitch, to leave the boundaries of the multiplayer map and walk around on the rest of the map.you are able to then walk through a wall onto the street next to the zoo, and the player is even able to swim in the river. however, travelling far enough will cause automatic death.PC Version GlitchesSuicide exploit: With the use of console commands, players can turn suicides into experience points awards (as opposed to penalties).
