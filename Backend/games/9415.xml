Critically panned upon release, the game is mostly notable for being the final game published under the LJN brand. LJN had previously been dissolved into Acclaim Entertainment in 1994. It is speculated that Acclaim was aware of the game's poor quality prior to release and chose to release it under the LJN name in order to separate it from the rest of the Acclaim line-up. The PC version was published by MicroProse Software, Inc.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1032560-21c7f4j.jpg</image></root>
