If you have a computer currently running Apple's OSX or any Unix/Linux variant... you already have it. Originally written in 1983 by Ron Schnell, this abstract text based adventure comes standard in the famous text editor Emacs. So if you have Emacs, you have this game.   The simplest way to fire up the game is to bring up a terminal or command line and enter:   emacs -batch -l dunnet   Once inside the game proper, you can issue the standard text based commands: "look, get, left, right, east, west, etc". Standard text based fare. The story progresses as the player interacts with the world, puzzles are solved, points are awarded and interactive fiction once again shines.</description><genres><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5285">Zork Classics: Interactive Fiction</game><game id="19301">Colossal Cave Adventure</game><game id="11797">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/98709/1444743-picture_4.png</image></root>
