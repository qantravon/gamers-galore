As such, Osman was intended as a spiritual successor to Strider. It was renamed Cannon Dancer in being licensed to Atlus.In contrast to Strider's futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a futuristic neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian Gulf setting (somewhat foreshadowing the rise of Dubai), while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle-Eastern protagonist named Osman who fights bare-handed without any weapons, using a variety of kicks. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26410">Strider</game><game id="6496">Strider 2</game><game id="12558">Strider</game><game id="18064">Run Saber</game><game id="31659">Moon Diver</game><game id="41457">Arabian Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2520171-untitled.png</image></root>
