Like      Super Robot Wars F/    F Final before it, Compact 2 is split into multiple parts: Part 1 and    Part 2 occur simultaneously, while   Part 3 continues from Part 2. Using the WonderSwan's internal memory, players can send their clear data to each successive game; several events are altered based on the player's previous save, gained items are carried over to Part 3, and a special final scenario can be unlocked by clearing the entire trilogy within 777 turns. The game, like  its predecessor, borrows almost all of its gameplay mechanics from F/F Final; however, it introduces the "Support System" which immediately became a core mechanic of the SRW franchise.   Earth Crisis introduces Ninja Senshi Tobikage and Hyper Combat Unit Dangaioh, while Cosmoquake features the debut of Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos.  The entirety of Compact 2 was remade into  Super Robot Wars Impact for the PlayStation 2.StoryAfter the One Year War, the elite Earth Federation forces known as the Titans ran out of control; in the resulting Gryps War, the megalomaniac Paptimus Scirocco would be defeated by the Argama team. As the war raged on, several enemies would appear to take advantage of the chaos: Dr. Hell, the Meganoids, the Dinosaur Empire, and the Muge Zorbados Empire. However, each of these groups would be crushed by the Super Robots.With the war seemingly over, the Earth Federation decided to reduce their military might. Unfortunately, the Vegan army appears, along with the Titan/Neo Zeon remnants and the mysterious Gaizok. Thus, the Earth again faces a crisis.The story begins on Earth, at the Federation Army Far East Division's Cyber Beast Force Base...Featured Series A list of the anime series which are featured in the game. Series that premiered in the Super Robot Wars series in this game are marked with "(new)".
