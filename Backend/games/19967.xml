All three games were included on a single cartridge, and the game was       packaged with two NES controllers, a  Zapper (for use with Duck Hunt), and a Power Pad (for use with World Class Track Meet). The three games are all the same as their single-cartridge form; the only difference is the fact that they are on a single cartridge.GameplaySuper Mario Bros.   The Super Mario Bros. Title Screen Super Mario Bros. is the first game in the  Mario franchise. It is a platforming game starring   Mario on his quest to rescue   Princess Peach from the clutches of   Bowser. The game is a traditional 2D side-scrolling platformer. Players control Mario as they guide him to the end of each level. Every world has eight levels, many of which contain secret shortcuts that can even assist the player in skipping large portions of the game. Every level has coins and items to gather, both aiding Mario in his quest. Gathering enough coins gives Mario an extra life, while power-ups (  Super Mushroom,   Fire Flower, and   Starman) can give Mario new abilities. The Super Mushroom allows Mario to grow in size, the Fire Flower gives Mario the ability to throw fireballs, and the Starman gives Mario temporary invincibility.Duck HuntThe title screen of Duck Hunt.Duck Hunt uses the Zapper, a light-gun peripheral for the NES. There are three modes in Duck Hunt: two of which involve different variations of ducks (one or two ducks), and a clay shooting mode. In the clay pigeon shooting mode, the player must be quicker and more accurate (as the clay pigeons are smaller and come out quicker). Throughout Duck Hunt, the player is accompanied by a dog, who has become quite infamous. The dog laughs at the player upon missing, and (to many players' dismay) cannot be shot.World Class Track MeetThe title screen of World Class Track Meet.World Class Track Meet uses the Power Pad, an NES peripheral which is a gray mat with large buttons that can be pressed by standing on them (so running can be simulated). World Class Track Meet has a variety of events to compete in, all of which can use the Power Pad's unique abilities. World Class Track Meet is the result of   Nintendo buying   Bandai's Stadium Events game, and then converting it into a game for North American audiences (the game was a part of Bandai's  Family Trainer series, which was mostly Japan-only).</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362275-nes_marioducktrack_2.jpg</image></root>
