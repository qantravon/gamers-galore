Unlike traditional snowboarding games, which have traditionally been racers, this game's single player plays more like a Tony Hawk game and has you complete certain objectives with no racing element whatsoever. The players can find chairlifts spread out along the course which will allow them to travel back up the mountain so that they are not forced to restart the entire level if they miss a crucial object.SoundtrackSpineshank - "New Disease"Static X - "This Is Not"Alien Ant Farm - "Courage"Orange 9mm - "When You Lie"Papa Roach - "Dead Cell"Shootyz Groove - "Mad For It"Insolence - "Natural High"Stereomud - "Don't Be Afraid"Powerman 5000 - "Bombshell"Godhead - "Inside You"Slayer - "Here Comes The Pain"Supersuckers - "The Evil Powers of Rock 'n' Roll"Pantera - "Mouth For War"</description><genres><genre id="33">Snowboarding/Skiing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17149">SSX 3</game><game id="18782">SSX Tricky</game><game id="1932">SSX</game><game id="17969">SSX Blur</game><game id="12418">SSX on Tour</game><game id="15979">SSX Out of Bounds</game><game id="18946">1080° Snowboarding</game><game id="19339">1080° Avalanche</game><game id="16647">Amped 3</game><game id="15510">Amped 2</game><game id="1509">Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding</game><game id="20954">Shaun White Snowboarding</game><game id="18062">Snowboard Kids</game><game id="18426">Snowboard Kids 2</game><game id="21938">ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding</game><game id="25743">Sunny Garcia Surfing</game><game id="20880">We Ski</game><game id="30947">Tony Hawk: SHRED</game><game id="33393">SSX</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2276078-box_spps.png</image></root>
