Ever wonder how things might be different, if you could go back in time and re-live your past? The main character of Shira Oka: Second Chances is given that chance to find out.
Will he get his act together, and become the person he always wanted to be? Will he pass all his classes with flying colors? Will he fall in love with the girl of his dreams? Or will he end up sad and lonely once again?
His fate is in your hands.
You control how he spends his time, who he becomes friends with, and who he falls in love with... if anyone. But no matter what choices you make, get ready for a roleplaying experience unlike any other.</description><genres><genre>Puzzle</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8587-1.jpg</image></root>
