<root><id>39346</id><name>Epic Meal Time</name><description>Gameplay is extremely similar to Fruit Ninja and other similar games, but instead of destroying or cutting the food, you lead it to Epic Meal Time host Harley Morenstein's mouth. Harley will readily eat any food that isn't a fruit/vegetable. Various power-ups help players along the way, and every so often, a rapid-tap mini-game will occur when one of the show's trademark concoctions is put into Harley's mouth. At the end of each round, a rating is given based on score, as well as the player is told (as in the show) that something absurd will be consumed next (example: "Next time, we eat a graveyard").The game boasts unlockables and DLC such as hats and power-ups, and it is hinted that MuscleGlasses will be available in the future.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31054">Fruit Ninja</game><game id="39347">Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2292643-emt_logo.png</image></root>
