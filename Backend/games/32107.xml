<root><id>32107</id><name>Cladun: This is an RPG!</name><description>NIS America's new PSP dungeon crawler fuses the make-your-own-hero mechanic of 3D Dot Game Heroes and an old-school Legend of Zelda feel with Disgaea's zany and outrageous humor and style.As well as being able to create your own character, you also get to create the final boss. This final boss will scale to your level so every time you fight him, he'll be stronger.All the dungeons are randomly generated and have 99 levels, but it is not mandatory to complete them all.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27860">3D Dot Game Heroes</game><game id="20939">Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice</game><game id="26831">Shiren the Wanderer</game><game id="32698">Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten</game><game id="25117">Half-Minute Hero</game><game id="38133">Legasista</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/83622/1440296-cladun_logo_clear_thumb.jpg</image></root>
