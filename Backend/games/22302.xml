It is the second in the series for the PlayStation 2, and the only title in the series to get an M rating from the ESRB. The game reuses the character models used in Bloody Roar: Primal Fury and ports them over from the Nintendo Gamecube game. This game's features include:Arcade ModeVersus ModeStory ModeSurvival ModeTraining ModeTime AttackCareer ModeGameplayUnlike previous titles, the Beast gauge is separate from the health meter and actually acts as its own health meter, which can make for new strategies for how to beat your opponent into oblivion.CharactersBloody Roar 4's roster consists of 18 characters, including 4 new fighters made for this game.Returning CharactersYugo/ The WolfLong/ The TigerAlice/ The RabbitStun/ The InsectShenlong/ The Tiger (A genetic clone of Long)Xion/ The UnbornBusuzima/ The ChameleonJenny/ The BatBakuryu/ The MoleGado/ The LionUriko/ The Half BeastShina/ The LeopardKohryu/ The Iron MoleUranus/ The ChimeraNew CharactersReiji/ The CrowNagi/ The SpuriousRyoho and Mana/ The Nine TailRyoho/ The Dragon (counted separately because this Ryoho fights without Mana)</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="11065">Shaman King: Power of Spirit</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2171262-box_broar4.png</image></root>
