The game was developed by Mark Hadley in conjunction with Blue Isle Studios with the goal of creating a scarier, more detailed, more involved Slender Man experience. The game was written by the creators of Marble Hornets, the first series of Slender Man-related videos on YouTube: Troy Wagner, Joseph DeLage III, and Tim Sutton. Slender: The Arrival was released on March 26, 2013.The beta was included for all that pre-ordered. The beta was a remake of the original Slender: The Eight Pages but with enhanced graphics, a camera view with zoom, and a new beach-side location.GameplaySimilar in nature to Slender: The Eight Pages, the primary gameplay revolves around the player exploring environments and collecting items while trying to avoid Slender Man. The closer the player comes to completing a given stage's particular objective, the more likely Slender Man will make his appearance. Slender Man cannot be fought, only avoided, and the player loses if Slender Man has the player in his sights for too long.PC System RequirementsMinimumWindows XP / Vista / 72.0 GHz or faster dual core processor (Quad Core Intel or AMD recommended)1 GB RAM (3 GB recommended)DirectX 9.0cNVIDIA 6800, 7600, 7800, 8xxx or better or ATI 1950 or better (GeForce 260 1GB or AMD HD4850 1GB recommended)2 GB HDDMouseKeyboard</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39410">Sanatorium</game><game id="38320">SCP Containment Breach</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2451204-slender-the-arrival-www.gamecover.com.br.jpg</image></root>
