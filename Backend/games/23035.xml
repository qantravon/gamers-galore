It's up to Jake, the game's protagonist, to destroy the main computer of the island to halt the nanomachines' control.   Gameplay Nano Breaker is a standard hack n' slash, action/adventure game. Jake wields a plasma sword, the game's main weapon, which can be upgraded through a basic skill tree, allowing for bigger combos or other alterations to Jake's performance in combat. Nano Breaker is most infamous (in a very loose, me-and-my buddies kind of way) for it's copious amount of blood, however. Enemies will gush out gallons (literally) of blood as you slash them, splattering over the stage during combat like paint buckets being thrown-about. This, however, works into the actual gameplay with a "Gallon Meter" on the bottom of the screen, counting exactly how much blood you've spilled. Going past certain amounts will net Jake with additional health or energy, as well as the ability to trigger a short 'super mode'. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15790">Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</game><game id="4493">Castlevania: Curse of Darkness</game><game id="16741">Devil May Cry 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2525221-box_nbreaker.png</image></root>
