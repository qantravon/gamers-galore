Celebration Stuff was the fourth such content addition to be released, and includes a variety of decorations like balloon, streamers, table centerpieces, and festively appointed furniture for all manner of parties.  Two new premade, vacant homes are also added to the lot bin where players can manually import them into an existing neighborhood.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/20737/762284-the_sims_2_celebration_stuff.jpg</image></root>
