It was developed once again by Rare. In this last edition, neither Donkey Kong nor Diddy Kong are playable. Instead, you play as Dixie Kong (from DKC 2) and her cousin Kiddy Kong, who is a new playable character.StoryDonkey Kong and Diddy Kong decide to take a fishing vacation after their hard work on keeping DK Isles safe from the clutches of K. Rool. But they mysteriously go missing and its up to Dixie Kong and her cousin, Kiddy to find them. Meanwhile, in the northern Kremisphere, the kremlings are back once again but now under the leadership of KAOS, a mysterious robot that is secretly being controlled by one Baron K. Roolenstein. Its up to Dixie and Kiddy to rescue Donkey and Diddy Kong and thwart K. Roolenstein's evil plans once again.GameplayBoss Time!Donkey Kong Country 3 retains the same gameplay from the previous two installments but with some new additions. One of the new additions is the use of vehicles on the world map screen. Unlike the plane used in the previous games, these vehicles range from a motorboat to a helicopter and help Dixie and Kiddy Kong get to different locations throughout the northern Kremisphere, as well as secret places that would be unreachable otherwise.The two kongs make their way through various levels like woodland areas and mechanical factories picking up all sorts of items along the way whether it be bananas, coins or balloons representing extra lives. They are once again aided by animals to guide them in defeating the kremling krew and other enemies that are about.In this edition, the Kong family are joined by the Brothers Bears who are situated all throughout the northern Kremisphere. They have their own dilemmas and will help Dixie and Kiddy in their adventures in exchange for bear coins and certain items found throughout the world.Hidden throughout the northern Kremisphere are caves that contain an important part of the game, banana birds. In order to free the birds from their crystallised cages, you have to match the sequence of sounds that play for you when you enter the cave. Some are given to you by the bears in exchange for helping them out. In order to unlock the true ending, you must obtain all 13 banana birds throughout the land.Playable CharactersDixie Kong - Girlfriend of Diddy Kong who can use her ponytail to glide along and reach certain places throughout the land.Kiddy Kong - Cousin of Dixie Kong who can use his weight to his advantage in certain scenarios.Supporting CharactersThe Kong FamilyWrinkly Kong - Having quit her job as a school teacher, Wrinkly now spends her time exercising, sleeping and playing games in her cave.

It featured a brand new world, Pacifica, as well as a new boss, Kroctopus. While both the new levels and the new boss offered some new ideas, the new levels were buggy at times and Kroctopus arguably didn't fit in too well with the Donkey Kong universe; while his name was similar to that of the octopus enemies in the original Donkey Kong Country, he appeared as a green blob with three arms made out of rendered spheres and 'claws', and was defeated by luring his arms into a lit bomb on a platform above him. Not a TNT barrel, a bomb.The game also sported a completely new soundtrack from David Wise, composer for Donkey Kong Country 2, although the music has been criticised for not holding up to that of the original by Eveline Fischer (now Novakovic).The port has also replaced the original Swanky Sideshow minigames with some new boat games from Funky, a star-collection game set in a sewer tube with Swanky, and an echidna-blocking game with Cranky Kong. Wrinkly's save caves have been replaced by Cranky's Dojo now that the game allows the player to save at any time on the world map by hitting the start button.The port has slightly changed physics from the original game which may be noticeable when playing them side by side; most notably that characters will move at a much slower rate in the port, including in the toboggan levels. There are also a few levels which have had objects shifted to fit with these slower character speeds, but sometimes this has caused the original puzzles of levels to be ruined, such as platforms being lowered to be accessible from points you couldn't before, and some DK coins being able to be collected without figuring out a puzzle and collecting them the way the game had originally intended.SoundtrackThe soundtrack for Donkey Kong Country 3 was the first soundtrack in the Donkey Kong Country series to not be solely composed by David Wise. Instead, Eveline Fischer was responsible for most of the composition with some help by David Wise.TracklistSoundtrack cover1. Dixie Beat 2. Crazy Calypso 3. Northern Kremisphere 4.
