Rush.  Gone were the dubiously significant "Torque" and "Drift" bars, replaced more the more user-friendly "Top Speed", "Acceleration", "Cornering" and "Traction".  Graphically, the game took significant steps forward from L.A. especially in the vehicle models, which featured richer textures and higher polygon counts.  2049 brought back the Stunt mode introduced in L.A. Rush.  Players still spent most of their time driving toward ramps in hopes of achieving some point-worthy result, but the introduction of wings into the game gave racers the control over their landings.  Along with the goal of achieving high scores for various stunts and flips, tokens could be collected in the stunt mode which unlocked various upgrades and new vehicles.  2049 was also released as a top-down racer for the game boy color.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1221">Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="8458">San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing</game><game id="13241">Hydro Thunder</game><game id="38336">Joy Ride Turbo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543569-box_rush2049.png</image></root>
