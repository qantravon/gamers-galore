In 1987 an advert for the game’s upcoming release caused some concerns due to the female character’s visible nipple. The original art was created by artist Luis Royo and was subsequently censored and covered up by art editor of Crash magazine, Oli Frey. Other versions of the censored advert and subsequent cover art for the game was further censored by retailers by having the logos placed over the offending nipple.The uncensored version with offending nipple fully visible.              The game itself is a standard platform shooter and follows the hero, Arkos a Megaterminator. Having once been the lieutenant of the evil galactic empress, Gremla (who’s nipple caused all the controversy), Arkos now fights against her cruel tyranny.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19862">Game Over II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/34468/960900-scan0006.jpg</image></root>
