<root><id>20709</id><name>Apple Town Story: Little Computer People</name><description>OverviewThis is simply a rehashed FDS port of Little Computer People, a game created originally by David Crane and Activision for various home computers. The game has received a graphical overhaul to be more cutesy and anime-like, including various close-up cutscenes. The player has some degree of control over a little girl and her pet cat, interacting with them to some extent.Like Little Computer People, the game plays very much like a primitive version of The Sims. Though the character will take care of their own needs, the player can cheer them up or provide activities for them to do, or simply watch their sophisticated (at the time) AI at work.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17463">The Sims</game><game id="17574">Little Computer People</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/10360-lcp.jpg</image></root>
