<root><id>9389</id><name>Bachelor Party/Gigolo</name><description>BackgroundWhen adult-game company  Mystique went out of business, PlayAround bought the rights to their games. Along with the original Mystique titles, PlayAround also released a number of their own adult-themed games. These games were released in pairs on special "double-end" cartridges.OverviewThe two games contained in this release are "Bachelor Party" and "Gigolo".Bachelor PartyBachelor Party is a re-release of the  original game created by Mystique. The game features a man bouncing pong-style back and forth, eliminating advancing rows of women. The gameplay is similar to titles like  Breakout, except the action plays out horizontally instead of vertically.GigoloGigolo is a re-working of  Cathouse Blues, another original game created by PlayAround (only with gender roles reversed). Instead of a man, it features a woman who must search the houses around town for a "good time". While that sounds easy enough, the player also has to deal with police, muggers, and houses that are wired with alarms. This is odd, because a gigolo is a male prostitute, while that title is attached to the version with the female hooker, not the man-whore.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7401">Bachelorette Party/Burning Desire</game><game id="2378">Bachelor Party</game><game id="14272">Philly Flasher/Cathouse Blues</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/635067-b_bachelorpartygigolo_back.jpg</image></root>
