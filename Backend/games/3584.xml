Originally released in 1994, the game tasked the player to assume the role of the son of Earth's ambassador in his mission to free the native inhabitants of the planet Ora, who were turned into slaves by the Ri, an alien race. Unlike in the aforementioned id titles, the player is able to crouch and jump.The shareware version of the game had just the first episode ("The Quest), while in the registered version all three episodes were playable: Operation "Cut-Off" and "Extermination".The game is notorious for its low quality sound effects and music.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="7694">Wolfenstein 3D</game><game id="5403">Rise of the Triad: Dark War</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81005/2407869-243652_depth_dwellers_dos_screenshot_title_screens.png</image></root>
