To do this, she travels to various planets in any order the player chooses, defeating the alien life that has inhabited each world and delving below each planet's surface to find the necessary items to stop the attack.The game is unashamedly based on the Nintendo game Metroid, which referred to its heroine as a "Space Hunter" in the manual. Though the games play differently, the success of Metroid clearly inspired more than a few elements of Space Hunter.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25951">Layla</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2442475-space_hunter_fc.jpg</image></root>
