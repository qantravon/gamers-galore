The goal is to deliver papers to all the houses specified by the player's route, while occasionally scoring bonuses by "shooting" excess papers at various targets along the way. The player must also avoid all the obstacles along the street, which range from traffic to dogs to RC cars to the Grim Reaper. The game was developed specifically for early 1990s computers and consoles; unlike the first, it never began life as an Arcade game.Unlike the original Paperboy, Paperboy 2 also features a girl who delivers papers. The player must also deliver papers to houses on either side of the street, whereas in the first the player simply had the one side to consider. Achieving certain objectives during the run, like foiling a criminal mid-robbery, will put the Paperboy on the front page of the newspaper that appears at the end of the stage.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19264">Rollerblade Racer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6087/602752-65_8.jpg</image></root>
