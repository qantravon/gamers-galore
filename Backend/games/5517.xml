The episodes are: The Hunt for Red Rock Rover.Kill Again Island.Dr. No Body.GameplayEach level in the game has a specific goal where you must destroy a radar dish by simply shooting it. You also have to locate dynamite, in order to destroy the exit door to exit the level. Along the way you will occasionally be hindered by locked doors. To unlock these doors you have to find a similarly coloured key. There are many different hazards that could either harm or instantly kill 006 and 1/2. The hazards were typical of action games such as spikes or acid pools. Puzzle elements include strategically moving objects to climb upon or finding items which help to make certain areas accessible (these include glasses to help see hidden platforms or running shoes to increase speed).
