The goal of the game is to fight through individual towers and defeat a boss at the end of each one, after which Fire Bam is deposited back onto the overworld.Fire Bam was created for the Famicom Disk System, which had been losing steam at that point in time due to the improvements made to regular NES cartridges. It doesn't help that the game is plagued with load time issues as a result of its disk-based nature. The game was never localized or released outside of Japan.GameplayThe usual pattern is to explore the overworld until the right portal is found, fight one's way through a fast-scrolling gauntlet of enemies and platforms and defeat the boss in a one-on-one fight. After leaving these tower areas, the overworld is expanded allowing for further travel (and providing the way towards subsequent towers).Fire Bam can purchase goods from friendly giant lizard shopkeepers, including healing items and stronger weapons.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9560/1704271-fire_bam_front.jpg</image></root>
