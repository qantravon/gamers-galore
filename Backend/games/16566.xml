<root><id>16566</id><name>F/A-18 Interceptor</name><description>This was the first flight simulator with a good sense of speed. It features the option to both land on runways and aircraft carriers. The setting is the coastline of San Francisco. No real story, just tough missions.  There is a free-flight mode and a story mode with 6 missions.  The free-flight mode allowed take-offs and landings from the carrier and different airfields around the bay area.  You could choose an F/A-18 or an F-16 to fly.  The Electronics Arts headquarters building was one of the few buildings in the game. The main 6 missions included air-to-air combat with MIGs, intercepting a cruise missile, and attacking a submersible aircraft carrier.  After each mission was finished you had to land your F-18 under manual control onto the aircraft carrier in the bay.  Chaff, flares, main cannon, and 2 types of air-to-air missiles were available.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1383">Jane's Combat Simulations: Advanced Tactical Fighters - Nato Fighters</game><game id="16981">Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1487/1342494-fa_18_interceptor_coverart.png</image></root>
