<root><id>8126</id><name>Mega-Bucks</name><description>Mega-bucks is a sprawling (for the time) treasure hunt through a flip screen mansion, as the teenage hero visits the mansion of his recently deceased uncle Maxabillion Brainbox the Third in search of his inheritance. In typical mad uncle fashion Max(abillion) has left his erstwhile heir a variety of object based puzzles to solve before he can earn his due.Published on Firebird's budget label Silverbird and retailing for just Â£1.99 in the UK in the spectrum format the game was a modest success. The programmer Andrew Deakin and the artist responsible for the graphics Ivan Horn have both gone on to greater(?) things but carried on working together, most recently working on Richard Burns Rally released in 2005.While the game was not a huge success at launch, the game appears to have gained a minor following purely through being a game seemingly difficult to emulate; appearing frequently in bugfix lists for the profusion of spectrum emulators that appear on the release of every electronic device capable of the feat. It remains in this authors memory purely due to the games ending which implied that you had failed in some way, but in fact there appears to have been no way to complete the game and inherit the fortune.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5202">The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12003/248352-mb2.jpg</image></root>
