In meticulously planned coups, the three Londoners living in a hip loft steal precious paintings from the best guarded museums in the world. The group then donates their millions, Robin Hood style, to development projects in Africa. Their goal is to share out the money of eccentric art collectors to the poor.PC System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7CPU: Pentium 4 2.4GHz / Athlon XP 2000+RAM: 1 GBHDD: 4 GB free disk spaceGraphics: 256 MB Graphics MemorySound Card: DirectX 9 CompatibleDirectX: Version 9.0cSupported Graphics CardsGeforce 8600 GS/Radeon X1300 or better</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/1043793-15_days_pc_002.jpg</image></root>
