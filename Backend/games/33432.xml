Casual players will find enjoyment, as will the more dedicated ones.At Blizzcon 2011 Rob Pardo from Blizzard stated that the game was in pre-production RD (research and development), and was close to enter full production. At that point there were around 90 developers working on the title.The project was reset during 2013 (see below), and 70% of the team was relocated to other projects.Project ResetOn May 28th 2013 rumors started to circulate that the 100 people that was working on the project had been reduced by 70, and that the remaining core team was now focusing on starting over. The expected publishing date was also pushed up to 2016, at the earliest.Blizzard spokesman Shon Damron confirmed the rumors with the following comment: "We’ve always had a highly iterative development process, and the unannounced MMO is no exception. We’ve come to a point where we need to make some large design and technology changes to the game. We’re using this opportunity to shift some of our resources to assist with other projects while the core team adapts our technology and tools to accommodate these new changes. Note that we haven’t announced any dates for the MMO".</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
