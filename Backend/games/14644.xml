It is based on the 1992 animated series of the Addams Family, rather than the movies, live-action TV show or the original comics.The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt has a somewhat unusual release history: originating on the SNES, it was later ported to the Game Boy and Nintendo's previous console the NES a few months later. It was also made available in Europe several months before the US, as Ocean was a UK-based publisher.GameplayThe player controls Pugsley, who must venture forth into his house in search of items hidden by Wednesday.Certain rooms shrink the protagonist in size such as the bathroom level. You also encounter the different characters of the cartoon series at each of the rooms, for example; you will encounter Lurch in the Attic stage.The game is known for its colourful graphics but high difficulty and total lack of a password feature.Critical ReceptionWhen the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 7 out of 10. He wrote, "...another version of the multi-platform game... if you played the SNES version, there is nothing here that is terribly different, except, of course, diminished graphics and sound. This is one of the better games for the NES system".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7505">Monster Party</game><game id="14307">Monster in My Pocket</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361109-nes_addamsfamilypugsleysscavengerhunt.jpg</image></root>
