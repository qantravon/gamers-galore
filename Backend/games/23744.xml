Plain Sight is an indie multiplayer third-person arcade action game developed and published by         Beatnik for the PC. The game pits up to 20 players against each other as        suicidal       ninja      robots in a gravity-less, surreal arena in space. Dashing and killing enemy robots (and collecting random star objects) increase your energy (giving you strength and making you a larger target), which can be "banked" into your point count by exploding. (Getting enemies caught in your explosion multiplies the banked points) The game also features upgrades (which are limited to a match) and persistent perks (which are bought with "stars", cumulative currency based on collected star objects). The PC version was released on April 5, 2010, with     PS3 PlayStation Network and    WiiWare versions in development. Game also includes a leaderboard and a offline practice mode. Game ModesDeathmatch - Every Ninja Robot for him/herself!
