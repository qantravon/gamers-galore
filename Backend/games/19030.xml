<root><id>19030</id><name>Majestic</name><description>Majestic was a subscription-based game that utilized a number of different communication mediums for play.  Players would have AOL Instant Messenger accounts integrated into the game shell, some of which were tied to NPCs important to progressing the storyline and some of which were randomly-assigned other players, who could be contacted for help if the player was stuck.  In addition, players could register their phone and fax numbers with the game to receive messages in the real world tied to gameplay.   Inspired by movies like   "The Game" and Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show, Majestic attempted to not only blur the line between the game and reality, but also tried to make playing less of a time investment so that players could participate without  spending hours of their life doing it. When first starting, players would be informed that the game's developer,    Anim-X, had been shut down and the game service had been discontinued. Players would then begin receiving messages from characters telling them that the shutdown was part of a conspiracy, and asked for the player's help in solving it.  Although recognized for its unusual concept, Majestic had troubles during its short run. EA temporarily suspended service after the September 11, 2001 attacks due to the game's subject matter, and eventually shut it down entirely in April 2002, citing too few players.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="649">Missing: Since January</game><game id="4766">Evidence: The Last Ritual</game><game id="21369">The Secret World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17360/1477341-majestic.png</image></root>
