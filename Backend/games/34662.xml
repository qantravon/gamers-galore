In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament.The game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of having only a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39510">Family Mahjong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360438-family_shanghai_ii_fc.jpg</image></root>
