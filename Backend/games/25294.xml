This means that unforced errors are extremely rare during rallies. Players can  create their own characters using an improved                                       character creator from                                             Virtua Tennis 3, and can play through a career mode that spans two circuits: Amateur and Professional Tours. Characters can alter their statistics by equipping different                                      rackets, and--though this does not have much influence on the strength of the characters--can be trained into specific types of players. For example, they can be developed to be a serve-and-volleyer, rocket server, hard hitter, fast runner, all-rounder, and much more. Gone are the numerical statistics that came with                                     Virtua Tennis 3. Up to four players can take part online and offline in both standard tennis matches - singles and doubles - and minigames. Six returning                                    minigames feature, including Pin Crusher, Avalanche, Court Mania, and Alien Attack, in addition to the six new ones. These range from Shopping Dash, where players must avoid tennis balls while collecting shopping items on the court, to Zoo Feeder, where players must feed zoo animals by hitting the correct food items towards them. Players no longer unrealistically dive for the ball, but instead stumble as they reach for shots out of reach. In addition, the crowd is in full 3D and responds to rallies in a more believable manner than in previous  Virtua Tennis titles.
