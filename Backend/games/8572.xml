The game-play is also rather similar: Players run, jump and shoot their way through several stages, usually from left to right; support vehicles that provide superior firepower can also be acquired.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="847">Metal Slug</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game><game id="3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2292688-cover.png</image></root>
