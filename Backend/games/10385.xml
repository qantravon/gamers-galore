By creating links of similarly colored Meteos, the blocks are sent towards the top of screen by jet propulsion. As the game progresses and the player launches more Meteos off the screen, the Meteos begin to rain faster, forcing the player to rely on split-second reflexes.GameplayThe game is played on of 32 different "Planets", each with individual characteristics that affect or impede gameplay - for example, some planets increase or decrease the size of the Meteos, whilst others may change the effect of gravity upon the falling Meteos and the way they are launched.ControlsThe game is playable by using either the DS Touch-screen and stylus or through the use of the D-pad and buttons. However, due to the fast-paced nature of the game, players often use the stylus control scheme. ReceptionUpon its release in 2005, Meteos received high critical acclaim. It was rated the rated the 52nd best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list, as well as attaining an aggregate score of 88/100 on both Metacritic and Game Rankings.SequelsMeteos has spawned a number of sequels, including: Meteos: Disney Magic, Released February 27, 2007Meteos Online Meteos for mobile phones and other wireless devices Meteos Wars for Xbox Live Arcade in December 2008Game ModesStar TripStar Trip is the story mode of Meteos, in which you travel from world to world choosing which path to take, each world you visit has different objectives, and whether or not you meet these objectives determines which worlds will be available to you on the next leg of your journey.Simple  In simple mode you play a single world of your choosing, you can set your difficulty and how many lives you have.
