The game was later remade on the PS2 and Gamecube as Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. Code Veronica was the first game of the main series not to use pre-rendered backgrounds and instead used real-time 3D backgrounds. Code Veronica still uses the familiar "tank" controls from the first three Resident Evil games, however, and the camera angles are pre-determined. The game takes place three months after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3. and follows the story of Claire Redfield and her brother Chris. The game takes place on Rockfort Island where Claire is imprisoned after her infiltration of an Umbrella Facility in Paris while looking for Chris in Europe.GameplayCode Veronica marks the first time the game features fully 3D environments.Much like previous main Resident Evil entries, Code: Veronica X mixes in third-person combat, exploration and puzzle solving. The combat still confines the player to stay stuck to the ground when firing their weapon and the notorious tank controls are still evident. The puzzles were made to be somewhat harder, though were still relatively easy by general standards. What is new is that both Claire and Chris can collect duel wielding weapons, such as duel Uzi's, which they can use to aim at two enemies simultaneously. Code: Veronica also marks the first time that the series brings forth full 3D environments for the main entries of the series over the pre-rendered backgrounds during the Playstation 1 era. Veronica X is also much lengthier than previous games, which commonly took up an average of 3-5 hours to complete, and could usually take around 8-12 hours. This is at the expense of having only a single story, however, like Resident Evil 3 instead of the intertwining stories akin to Resident Evil 2, or the mildly differing takes of the same story ala Resident Evil. Saving is still done by finding any of the many typewriters littered throughout the game, and still require the player has at least one ink ribbon item to save. What is new, however, is should you die the game will allow you to reload your latest save from the ''Death'' screen, rather than having to head back to the main menu.Veronica did still make a few steps back, however. A lot of the gameplay updates from Resident Evil 3 were scrapped, such as creating your own ammo and the dodge maneuver, but more noticeable is the fact that walking up/down stair cases is once more automated and can't be performed manually. This could result in some minor annoyance since if a zombie was to be walking up the stairs, you'd have to wait for him to reach the top for you to be allowed to walk down.While significantly more minor, zombies also couldn't have their heads explode like in previous Resident Evils. When shot with a magnum, or close range shotgun blast to the head, the zombies head would gush out blood, but would still stay intact.Herbs and First-Aid SpraysCarrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First-Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will no restore any health.Red Herb - On its can do nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will now heal roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, including Poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.WeaponsCombat KnifeA standard survival knife that Claire finds in prison office where the game begins. Unlike previous Resident Evil entries, the knife can prove to be surprisingly effective and is much more powerful. It's still not a suitable replacement for any of the firearms, though it doesn't constitute a death-wish should the the player decide to test it out.Beretta M93 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Claire finds near the beginning, after she first meets Steve Burnside. It fires rather rapidly for a pistol and is reliable against most lesser enemies - zombies and Cerberus dogs in particular. It can potentially be upgraded to allow a triple burst shot, should the player find the components required. Chris can also use this handgun should the player leave it in an inventory box as Claire for Chris to collect.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Glock Model 17 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Chris Redfield brings with him when he embarks on the rescue for his sister Claire Redfield. It primarily features all of the same attributes as Claire's Beretta and can also be modified also, though instead of giving a three shot burst it increases the overall power.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Colt PythonA recurring weapon within the series, the Colt Python Magnum Pistol can be attained once more in Code: Veronica. Found during Chris Redfield's segment of the story, it is immensely powerful and kill all enemies with one shot, and it a solid contender against boss B.O.W's. Ammo is fairly scarce though, to make up for its well retained status as one of the powerful firearms in the game.Maximum Ammo Count - 6 rounds.Ammunition - .357 Caliber Rounds.Bow GunMuch like her time during Resident Evil 2, Claire will have access to a bow gun. It's made to be significantly weaker than its RE2 counterpart, however, and relies solely via bug-bite attacks with its usually large containment of ammo. It can hold as many arrows at once as Claire can find, and can also stock explosive bolts if the player combines a pack with explosive gun-powder.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Bolts  Explosive Bolts.Calico Model 100 Dual PistolsDual weapons were a first for the series, introduced early on via the Calico Model 100 Dual Pistols. They were reliable against most enemies because of their power and imbued ability to aim at two simultaneous enemies. Their ammo count was ranked as a percentage and no other ammo could be found, giving them a very limited use. Because they're still technically two firearms, they take up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Ingram Machine PistolsInitially introduced during short segment where the player controls Steve Burnside, they are primarily used throughout Chris Redfield's side of the story. They are only made available, however, should Claire give Rodrigo Juan Raval her lighter before hand. Much like the Calico Pistols, they label their ammunition via percentage and no ammo can be found once they've run out. The Ingram Pistols fire-rate is significantly faster than the Calico Pistols, and can also be dual wielded allowing the player to aim at two different enemies simultaneously. Because they're still technically two firearms, they up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Golden LugersThough they are seen frequently during the main story--as a puzzle item and Steve's weapons of choice before receiving the dual machine pistols--they are only used as a weapon in the Battle Game minigame when playing as Steve Burnside. They are similar to the Calico Pistols, though are much slower to fire. Like close to all firearms in the Battle Game they have infinite ammo.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.M79 Grenade LauncherAlso returning from Claire's repertoire in Resident Evil 2 is the Grenade Launcher; an all-round reliable weapon, suitable for virtually any encounters - including boss battles. It features multiple types of grenade types, including the default grenades as well as flame, acid and gas. It can store as many ammo as possible so long as it's all the same type of grenades. Should you switch them out for a different type of grenade, the grenades initially in the weapon will stack nicely in the characters inventory only taking up a single slot no matter how much ammo it stacks.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Multiple variety of grenades.Spas 12 Gauge ShotgunFirst found by Chris, the 12 Gauge fills in the mandatory Shotgun slot for Code: Veronica. It carries a lot of the expected attributes, though is surprisingly weaker than most shotguns of the series and isn't as easy to fall back on for boss battles. It is non-the-less suitable against zombies at close-range and some of the larger B.O.W's such as Hunters.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 shots.Ammunition - 12 Gauge Rounds.AK-47 Assault RifleA rather unorthodox weapon for a Resident Evil game, the AK-47 is only found during Chris' segment of the story. Much like the dual wielding weapons, it's ammo count is labelled via percentage, though extra AK ammo can be procured. It is fully automatic and packs a great deal of ammo, proving vital against any and all enemies encountered.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by %, with each shot taking roughly 1%.Ammunition - 7.62x39mm Soviet Rounds.M37 Sniper RifleThe first ever sniper rifle introduced into the series, the M37 is used only once during a mid-game boss battle against the once-human Alexander Ashford, later dubbed Nosferatu. It is most often seen in the hands of Alfred Ashford as he pesters her throughout the first half of the game. During the one occasion it's available, it allows the player to go into a first-person view mode for better accuracy (another first for the main series, discounting Resident Evil Survivor). It only has 7 rounds, though that may more than the player requires, should they be able to shoot Nosferatu directly in its exposed heart. This is easier said than done, however, with the icy fog surrounding the area and Nosferatu's constant expulsion of a poisonous gas.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 sniper rounds.Ammunition - N/A.Linear LauncherThe end game one-off weapon and Rocket Launcher equivalent for Code: Veronica, the Linear Launcher is a strange weapon that fires electrical homing rockets. It is only used canonically during the finale battle against the mutated blob-form of Alexia Ashford. It can be unlocked for the main game with infinite ammo should the player gain an S rank - as well as the Battle Game minigame, with the same properties, should the player gain an S rank with every character.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.CharactersClaire RedfieldThe initial leading protagonist, Claire is roped into another zombie infested crisis after she attempts to learn more about her brother Chris Redfield's whereabouts. She is playable throughout the first half of the game where she is relegated to the role of an NPC for the second half - minus one section where you gain control of her for a short while as she attempts to save Steve Burnside. Voiced by Alyson Court.Chris RedfieldThe main protagonist during the second half of the game and Claire Redfield's brother. Chris was forwarded a message by Leon S. Kennedy about Claire's predicament on Rockfort Island and travels over to try and save her. By this time, only months since the destruction of Raccoon City, the S.T.A.R.S team has been disbanded, yet despite this Chris still chose to wear a S.T.A.R.S uniform during this excursion.Voiced by Michael Filipowich.Steve BurnsideSteve with his original less-recognisable Veronica haircutA supporting protagonist and love-interest towards Claire Redfield. Steve is a brash and insecure teenager and fellow prisoner on Rockfort Island. A complete show off, Steve is always attempting to win Claire Redfield with bouts of bravery, putting himself at huge risk of danger at every turn.Voiced by Bill Houston.Alfred AshfordThe first antagonist the player encounters, Alfred Ashford is in charge of the Rockfort Island base. He is an eccentric yuppie, with an ''above-average'' IQ and a fondness for using sniper-rifles. Alfred's also has a rather peculiar laugh that almost resembles a little girls.Voiced by Peter Oldring.Alexia AshfordThe primary antagonist and twin sister to Alfred. A certified genius, Alexia was given the duties of leading an entire team of scientists within Umbrella by the age of ten. This infamous capacity of skill garnished her a rivalry with fellow Umbrella Scientist William Birkin.Voiced by Leila Johnson.Albert WeskerDespite apparently 'dying' at the hands of his own creation, The T-002 Tyrant, during Resident Evil Wesker returns into the fold, empowered with enhanced agility and strength.Voiced by Richard Waugh (This marks the first time Richard voices Wesker)Rodrigo Juan RavalThe prison commander who captures Claire Redfield during the opening CGI cutscene - and releases her as an act of good-will when the base is assaulted.Voiced by Martin Roach.PlotClaireClaire has some help this time around.The game takes place three months after the destruction of Raccoon City. It begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Corporation base in Paris, after leaving Leon S. Kennedy and Sherry Birkin to search for her brother, Chris. Claire gets caught during her raid, and she is captured and taken to Rockfort Island where she meets with an inmate named Steve Burnside and they fight for their survival against the island's T-virus infected zombies. In the meantime, Albert Wesker is on a mission from Umbrella to recover the mysterious T-Veronica Virus and it's his unit's fault that Rockport is now infected. Claire and Steve manage to escape in a plane but it was set on autopilot to go to an Umbrella facility in the Antarctic, by the island's commander, Alfred Ashford. Alfred did that so he could awaken his sister from a cryogenic sleep that she was in for 15 years after she had an injection of T-Veronica Virus. Claire and Steve defeat Alfred and escape in a digger, while Alfred limps over to his sister and experiences her awakening before dying. Alexia summons giant tentacles and grabs Steve and Claire's digger recapturing them both.Chris%26nbsp%3BCross-dressing villains! Can you dig it?The game then flips over to Chris Redfield's perspective. After learning from Leon that his sister has been taken to Rockfort he travels there but learns she has been long gone. He has an encounter with Albert Wesker and almost dies, but is saved as Alexia appears on the screen and stuns Wesker because he thought she had been dead for years. Wesker takes off to Antarctica and Chris follows. He is reunited with Claire and the two of them set out to find Steve. When they find Steve she realizes that Alexia has been experimenting on him with the T-Veronica Virus and he has mutated into a giant reptilian monster and tries to kill Claire. Claire runs into a prison cell but is grabbed by Alexia's tentacles, before Steve, who has temporarily regained his sanity, breaks through the bars and saves Claire, being fatally wounded by Alexia in the process. He reverts to human form and tells Claire that he loves her (even though they barely know each other) before dying.Meanwhile Wesker and Chris fight Alexia, but Wesker is overwhelmed by her strength and he flees. Chris manages to defeat her, but she comes back to life after Chris activates the self destruct system, releasing all the locks in the facility to free Claire. Chris then destroys Alexia once and for all before he and Claire run to the emergency elevator where they see Wesker and his men taking Steve's body for further experiments. Claire runs to the plane, and Chris and Wesker have another showdown until they are separated by an explosion. Wesker vows to get his revenge next time they meet and then they both run to avoid dying in more explosions. The game ends with Claire and Chris escaping and Chris vowing to take down Umbrella once and for all.EnemiesZombiesThe walking dead are once again prevalent in Code: Veronica and share a lot of the usual properties of their other Resident Evil kin; slow, shambling movement, dangerous up close but susceptible to all weapons within the game. On occasion, zombies will vomit out acid if they can't quite reach the player.Cerberus HoundAnother trademark enemy of the series, the Cerberus Hounds are always encountered in packs and contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog. They're rather weak fortunately, and can be taken down swiftly with a few handgun or shotgun shots. Regardless, even with their rampant speed and tenacity, player-characters are still just ever-so-slightly faster and can outrun them.BandersnatcherLarge, yellow one-armed monsters, Bandersnatchers have only appeared in the Veronica games. They rely on their single long arm to stretch and attack the player, and will do so very frequently given the opportunity. They can also use their arm to latch onto walls and maneuver through the environment following the player. They're pretty sturdy as well and stand as one of the antagonising enemies within the game.Bandersnatchers are also only encountered on Rockfort Island during Claire's portion of the story, though Chris does face one as he searches for Claire on the island.Hunter IIWhile being very similar in appearance to the Hunter Alpha's from the original Resident Evil, these Hunter models are much more advanced and sophisticated; they can be partnered with a small surveillance robot called Seekers that'll search for its targeted prey, alerting any nearby Hunters should it locate it. They attack very much like all Hunters of the series and can still commit an instant-kill attack should the player's health be in the Caution state or lower. Hunters have formidable resistance to most weapons and are best contended with the Colt Python Magnum or AK-47 Assault Rifle - running away would be the best alternative.They are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story as they were brought in by Albert Wesker himself, who programmed them to specifically hunt down Chris.SweeperSweepers are a variant of the Hunter II model, distinguished by their reddish colour. They attack in the same patterns and can still be called upon via one of the Seeker robots. What most separates them from the standard Hunters is that their attacks can poison the player.These, too, are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story.Black WidowThese are the giant spiders of Veronica, instead opting for Black Widows over the usual tarantula arachnids. While they look significantly different from their peers, they act very similar and have the same array of attacks, with their poison-spit once again acting as their greatest weapon.CrowsAs always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They do minimal damage and can often be killed with a single bullet; their numbers are always many, however. Sometimes a shotgun blast might be worth it to take a pack down, but otherwise they're best just ignored.BatsBats function nearly the exact same as crows. The one particular difference is that they can be warded away should the player equip the lighter.MothsOnly encountered in the Antarctica base, Moths primarily function similar to crows. They constantly emit a poisonous gas, however, and can also latch onto the player leaving a maggot sack on the characters back; the player is forced to wait for the character to throw the sack off before they can leave the area. They're easy to kill, but because they often respawn once the player has leaved, it's most profitable to dash past them.Albinoid InfantThese are only encountered briefly when Claire Redfield enters a lab to collect a specific painting; they can't be killed and only act as a minor obstacle for walking through the lab. One of them will escape and will eventually become a boss battle later on.Alexia TentacleSprouting through the environment, these are tentacles spawned by the now monstrous Alexia Ashford. They will block the players path, forcing the player to shoot any that they will encounter. Fortunately they are relatively weak and don't require much ammo.Boss BattlesGulp Worm Part IWhile it isn't given much of an introduction, a giant worm titled the Gulp Worm will eventually be found as Claire Redfield burrowing across the outside the Military Training Facility. During this occasion it is completely option to fight and can be largely ignored if the player is fast enough. The option to fight is still there, though, but would primarily be a waste of ammo since it doesn't reward anything minus it's evacuation of the area, and will still be encountered later on as Chris Redfield.Gulp Worm Part IIOnce Chris Redfield arrives at Rockfort Island to save his sister Claire, unbeknownst that she's already left for Antarctica, he is ambushed by the Gulp Worm from before. After swallowing Rodrigo Juan Raval whole, Chris is forced to fight it. It's design includes a lot of surprise attacks, burrowing underground then quickly resurfacing for an attack. Sometimes it'll pop out and do a kind of roar, allowing the opportunity to attack it.While this battle is going on, the elevator that'll take Chris up to the surface is making its slow descent; it essentially acts as the timer for the boss battle, but if the elevator arrives before the player kills the Gulp Worm they can opt to avoid this battle and just use the elevator. Choosing this outcome will deprive the player of the lighter Rodrigo may give, however - if Claire gave it to him before hand that is.Tyrant T-103 Part IAn alternate version of the Mr. X Tyrant model encountered during Resident Evil 2, this model is encountered twice by Claire Redfield. It differs in appearance from its coated brethren, equipped with a large, round mallet-like right fist with a large claw--as is custom with most Tyrant models-- for its left. The first time it is encountered, the player is cornered in a narrow passage with the Tyrant impeding the players progress forward, with a raging fire blocking the rear. Should the player walk into the fire, they will die instantly, forcing the player to unload everything they have into the Tyrant as it slowly walks them.Tyrant T-103 Part IIThe Tyrant is once again fought just as Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside are attempting to escape Rockfort Island. Somehow managing to latch onto the cargo hold, the player has to weaken the Tyrant with gunfire and then attempt to knock the Tyrant out the back with a large crate released from its safety harness. The Tyrant is otherwise invincible and cannot be killed without attempting to knock it out through the back with the crate.NosferatuOnce Alexander Ashford--the man twins Alfred and Alexia were cloned from--he was experimented on with the Veronica Virus to such an extent that he became yet another addition to the B.O.W library. Initially seen through a grated floor, tightly strapped to a chair with a huge halberd resting on him, he eventually manages to escape and is fought on a rooftop by Claire Redfield. His main source of attack is through a constant expulsion of poisonous gas that covers a huge area of effect; up close, he has a series of appendages that have sprouted out of multiple areas of his body that he can attack with. Nosferatu moves slowly, though the large cast of fog that covers the battleground can make attacking him difficult.At this point the player has access to a Sniper Rifle with 7 shots available; using the first-person view, the player can potentially kill Nosferatu with a single hit should they shoot his exposed heart well enough. Whether Claire is poisoned during this fight also factors later on in the story when Chris Redfield finds her. If she was poisoned, Chris must search for a specific antidote (blue herbs won't work) before the story can carry on.Albinoid AdultThe full grown Albinoid creature Claire encountered only hours before has now fully grown into a huge amphibious lizard-like monster. Completely surfaced under a shallow pool--literally, within a swimming pool--it is the de-facto guardian of an emblem the player needs to collect. The Albinoid will periodically discharge an aura of electricity, however, making it very dangerous to enter. The Albinoid is completely harmless otherwise, as it doesn't leave the pool. The player can opt to kill it, but if timed right can also enter the pool and collect the emblem with minimal damage.Giant Black WidowFirst seen under a sea of ice covering the main hall of the Umbrella Antarctica Base, Chris Redfield is forced to use a crane to crack the ice open to pull out the corpse of Nosferatu to claim his signet ring. This of course unleashes the Giant Black Widow. Simply massive, the Black Widow attacks much like its smaller kin but with a much larger poison spit arc.Steve BurnsideLike her father Alexander, Alexia infected Steve Burnside with the Veronica virus after she captured him and Claire. With a brief stint back as Claire during Chris' portion of the story, she finds him strapped to a chair with a large halberd resting on him exactly like Alexander. Just as Claire attempts to release him from the chair, Steve begins to mutate turning into a kind of green ogre. He equips the halberd with ease and begins to chase Claire. Steve isn't intended to be fought and the player can only run. Steve can kill the player with just two hits and a series of gates are being locked down through the hallway, forcing the player to stop for nothing.Alexia Ashford Humanoid FormComing off of Claire's encounter with the mutated Steve, Wesker and Alexia--now nude and mutated into a grey-ish colour--engage in a fight with Wesker only just scraping by; noticing Chris Redfield hiding nearby, he calls it onto his ''best man'' to take care of her. Alexia herself is a relatively easy battle as they go, but her attacks can do severe damage. She will walk slowly towards the player, leeching a small line of blood which quickly bursts into flames. If the player is caught in it they have to wait through the animation of Chris attempting to wave the flames off.Alexia Ashford Blob FormShe is initially seen once again in her humanoid form as she halts Claire as she attempts to run away. If the player doesn't react, shooting Alexia with literally anything, then Alexia will kill Claire causing a game over. If the player does shoot her, she will then transform into a huge blob creature with what look like dragonfly wings, but still retaining a majority of her previous mutations face. Because of Alexia's size, the player has very little room to maneuver through and can mostly run in a 75 degree angle. Alexia herself mostly relies on her large tentacles that'll slam down on the player. She also summons a group of small pod like creatures that plant themselves and spout out a strange-tail that'll whip the player. The player can kill them (though they prove difficult because of their size) Alexia will eventually replace them with more. In True Resident Evil fashion, five minute timer is ticking down during this battle.Alexia Ashford Dragonfly FormAfter Alexia Blob Form has taken enough damage, she will exit what was essentially a sack and hover above the player. At the same time the Linear Launcher, which Chris and Claire prepared to power-up, is now available. Using the Linear Launcher, the player is to try and shoot down Alexia; her constant movement can make this tricky, however. Her only attack during this form is that same line of fluid she shoots out that bursts into flames. This form of Alexia isn't particularly difficult as a boss and the difficulty is built around the 5 minute timer that'll still be ticking down during this battle.SoundtrackDisc 1Resident Evil: Code Veronica Original Soundtrack (Japanese cover art.)The MovieTitle CallingPrologueOpening - Claire VersionThrown Into DespairOnce AgainFirst ContactDeath SiegeSteve's ChafeIncomingPutrid SmellThe Palace of InsaneA Moment of ReliefInfantsHot RescueThrough the ScopePiano RollGreetingsInductionOther side of GlassGetting OutTarget LockedPulsating Right ArmHere Comes the KnightEntrapmentCuriosityFatherLachrymalThe Suspended DollOne-man ShowAshford's Music BoxPandora's BoxThe Secret DoorNot AlexiaA State of EmergencyIt's Back!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version AAs You WishRevenge!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version BMidnight SunCrash!BlancThe Confined ITYou Think You're Safe NowResonance of BloodGo With the DiggerThe Theme of NosferatuThe Ending of the BeginningDisc 2The Opening- Chris VersionI Need To KnowR.I.P.
