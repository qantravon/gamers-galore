Both it and True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club were released in the same year of 1991, with the Japanese release of Waialae and True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links the following year.Harukanaru Augusta is an in-depth golf simulator, rather than an Arcade-style golf game. It has a lot of customization options for the player's stance and clubs, and the player can consider the wind direction and topography before every swing. The golfers are depicted as digitized sprites of actors, both in the portraits and whenever the player's character takes a swing.  </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38171">Masters New: Harukanaru Augusta 3</game><game id="38339">Mecarobot Golf</game><game id="39086">World Masters Golf</game><game id="40040">Super Birdie Rush</game><game id="42832">St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2898/424331-harukanaru_augusta.jpg</image></root>
