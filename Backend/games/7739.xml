The game is a re-imagining of Bram Stoker's Dracula with a strong inspiration taken from German director F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu.StoryThe protagonist, James, is on his way to his sisters' wedding, but when he arrives at the castle where the ceremony in going to take place, he finds out that something seems to be wrong. He quickly realizes that his future brother-in-law is in fact a vampire, and that the fiend has taken a hold of his entire family.GameplayThe objective of the game is to search the castle and to save members of the protagonist's family within a two-hour time limit. Their deaths are pre-determined and they will die if not rescued quickly.The castle's interiors are randomly generated at the beginning of any new game and therefore the very short two hour game experience isn't much of an issue, as the replayability value is huge - every room will always seem fresh and unexpected to the player.System RequirementsMinimumOperative System: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XPProcessor: Pentium III 733 or equivalentRAM Memory: 128 MBVideo Memory: 16 MBHard Drive Space: 350 MB</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10157">Clive Barker's Undying</game><game id="6730">Painkiller</game><game id="30087">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</game><game id="5651">Penumbra: Overture</game><game id="3346">Penumbra: Black Plague</game><game id="23596">Penumbra: Requiem</game><game id="18678">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62890/1424421-nosferatu_wrath_of_malachi_cover.jpg</image></root>
