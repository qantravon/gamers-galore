A year and two months after Drop 7 was released on the iPhone, the game was ported to the Android market place. Drop 7 is $2.99 on both the iPhone and Android Marketplaces. Gameplay The game is played with touch controls on a 7x7 square grid. In each round, the player places a disc that falls from the top of the grid. Each disc has a number 1-7, or a blank. Whenever the number of any disc matches the number of contiguous discs in a row or column, that disc disappears and also hits any blank discs it touches. When a blank is hit twice, it turns into a numbered disc. After a number of turns, the round ends and a full row of blank discs emerges from the bottom of the grid. There is no time limit, and discs may be dropped at the player's leisure. The objective is to eliminate discs and score combos for as long as possible until the grid is full and it is impossible to place another disc. If the player clears the screen of all discs, then the player given a large point bonus.ModesNormal Mode is the basic way to play. You will drop a mixture of colored and gray discs, and the levels will come more frequently as you go on.  Hardcore Mode starts with the levels coming quickly, but you won't be given gray discs to drop.  Sequence Mode is excactly like Normal Mode, except you (and everyone else in the world) will get the same discs in the same order every time, so you can work on perfecting the ultimate strategy.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16966">Yoshi's Cookie</game><game id="29086">Unify</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/961319-img_0006.jpg</image></root>
