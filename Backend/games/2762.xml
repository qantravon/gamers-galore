The player may select from three courses/locations: United States, Great Britain, and Japan. By progressing through Tournament mode, the player will develop better skills, allowing him or her to hit the ball harder and with greater precision, and also provides the player the use of new, better golf clubs. While the game possesses no save option, it does provide a code that can be used in order to start over at a particular round.Practice mode gives players a chance to hone their golf skills and allows them access to all skill levels and golf clubs.In play, the golfer's caddy provides useful information based on the player's skill level. At the lowest levels, the caddy will only be able to show the distance from the ball to the tee. However, as the player progresses through the rounds, the caddy can give more situational advice.The game utilizes a traditional control scheme, requiring the player to stop a moving meter at given points in order to determine height and strength of a shot. Upon reaching the green, the view switches to a closeup of the ball's position, and provides the player with a simple map of the green for easier shot making.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21954">PGA Tour Golf II</game><game id="3325">Pebble Beach Golf Links</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2369001-genesis_arnoldpalmertournamentgolf.jpg</image></root>
