The player is pitted against the S.P.E.C.T.R.E-like organisation NOSTRA. There are 14 missions spanning locations around the globe, like Frankfurt, Venice, Pamana  Florida to complete in which the G-6155 Interceptor will morph between car, boat and when it's taken substantial damage, a motorcycle.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11272">Stuntman</game><game id="5930">Mach Rider</game><game id="19346">SpyHunter 2</game><game id="8584">Terminator 3: The Redemption</game><game id="22471">Ultimate Stuntman</game><game id="1508">Dead in the Water</game><game id="12167">Stuntman: Ignition</game><game id="13885">Auto Destruct</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285699-box_sh.png</image></root>
