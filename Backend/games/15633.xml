Family Fun Stuff was the first such content addition to be released, and includes a number of decorations for characters interested in an oceanic or medieval motif.  Three new pre-made, vacant houses are also added to the lot bin where they can be manually imported to an existing neighborhood.Finally, the American band The Barenaked Ladies recorded several songs which were added to the game's Pop music radio station.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/578/777804-38559614.jpg</image></root>
