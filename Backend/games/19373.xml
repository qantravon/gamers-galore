The game was released for ColecoVision and Atari 2600, with the former offering superior graphics. An Intellivision was initially planned but never saw release. The game features, in a sound chip version, a movement from Beethoven's 6th symphony.StoryGargamel has kidnapped Smurfette. While   Gargamel has wanted to eat Smurfs, turn them into gold, or simply destroy them throughout Smurf canon, it is not clear what his motivations are here. Regardless, the player takes control of a Smurf who must rescue Smurfette.GameplayThe levels scroll right to left while the player must execute jumps to traverse obstacles. These include fences and stalagmites, while enemies include spiders and bats. The player has an energy bar that depletes over time, while failure to negotiate an obstacle will kill the player. Jumping is the only method in which the player can negotiate obstacles (other than moving the Smurf left and right). The game requires exact jump and timing.Levels include a forest, cavern, and eventually Gargamel's laboratory.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/40/11888-smurfs.jpg</image></root>
