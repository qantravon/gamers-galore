<root><id>40165</id><name>The Money Game</name><description>OverviewThe Money Game is a stock market simulation game where the goal is to raise money through the wise purchasing and selling of various types of stock. Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool.The game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13426">Wall Street Kid</game><game id="39909">Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2349337-the_money_game_coverart.png</image></root>
