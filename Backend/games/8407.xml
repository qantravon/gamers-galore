Shogun blends Risk-like turn-based strategy with real-time tactical management. The Sengoku period (during which the game is set) and Sun Tzu's The Art of War are central concepts; the Sengoku period was a hundred-year swath of internecine, territorial warring and Tzu's work provides loading screen quotations and the basis for the game's battlefield AI. A sequel was released on March 15, 2011 named Total War: Shogun 2.GameplayShogun: Total War is divided into turns: at the beginning of each turn each faction will decide what units and buildings to construct in which regions and then move their armies. When the end turn button is pressed each faction's orders are executed simultaneously; if two opposing armies occupy the same territory the outcome of the battle can either be determined automatically or the player can switch to a real-time tactical battle. Turns cycle through the four seasons with weather and wind conditions affected which, in turn, affect battles.Terrain also plays a huge role in the tactical battles. Ranged units on higher ground gain large rage bonuses, melee units are more effective, and units attempting to climb up the incline will suffer a huge speed penalty. Calvary units lose maneuverability and effectiveness in forests and lose speed in snowy winter situations. Ranged units can be hindered by rain, with bows becoming less effective and guns failing to work altogether, and forests vastly decrease accuracy as missiles are blocked by trees. These elements also mean that the deployment phase is extremely important as factions holding the high ground can easily defeat a force nearly twice their size.All units have an honor rating: honor is the experience level of the unit, with higher honor making units far more effective in battle and less likely to rout when they take heavy loses. Generals also earn a honor rating that increases upon their success in battle; this in turn bestows bonuses on the armies they command. This encourages the player to preserve their elite units, as throwing them into enemy lines will both lose you the elite unit and also increase the honor of your enemy's unit. Units can earn honor in multiple ways; training in certain provinces or in higher level buildings can increase their honor but the most common way is to earn honor is to defeat enemy units in battle.Another element to the strategic half of the game is the agent units. These units are trained exactly like regular units but they each have different functions. Emissaries are used to negotiate treaties with opposing factories and spies can be used to see the strengths of units in enemy regions, but by far the most useful is the ninja (or the geisha, a unit with similar abilities). The ninja can kill specific characters such as spies or generals. A general with a very high honor might be next to impossible to kill on the battlefield, but using the ninja to kill him while he sleeps can confuse and disorientate his army and leave them leaderless and vulnerable in battle. Uniquely, each assassination mission undertaken is accompanied by a video of the ninja attempting to eliminate his target. These videos show either the ninja killing his target or the target catching and killing the ninja.Playable FactionsThere are seven playable factions in Shogun: Total War: Shimazu (green), Mori (red), Oda (orange), Imagawa (light blue), Takeda (black), Hojo (purple) and Uesugi (blue).ShimazuThe Shimazu are based in a secure location in the south-east of the map.
