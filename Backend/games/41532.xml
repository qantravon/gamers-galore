The player is tasked with taking a chunk of underground and creating various rooms that will give different advantages for defending. The types of rooms will also draw minions to do the player's bidding. Players can train those minions to mine for materials and defend the dungeon when heroes invade. The developers stated they will be releasing a modification tool called "Dungeoneer", allowing players to create new maps, campaigns, and game modes.The game was successfully kickstarted on January 3rd, partially thanks to an endorsement by Peter Molyneux. The game was chosen for release through Steam Greenlight on January 15th.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15960">Evil Genius</game><game id="24119">What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?</game><game id="21864">Overlord</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="13062">StarCraft</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/122373/2429892-warfortheoverworld.png</image></root>
