Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma talked briefly about the design approach to this new game. They want to address key issues brought up by media and fans alike over the years.They are currently "rethink[ing] the conventions of Zelda." Aonuma specifically called out the linear story progression and single-player-only gameplay as being ripe for a fresh approach. The team is "setting aside" these conventions and wants to go "back to basics" to create a "reborn" Zelda game for Wii U. Aonuma also mentioned they were already trying to do this a bit with Skyward Sword but were unable to circumvent the linear design of the game at the time.At E3 2013, Aonuma mentioned that part of the reason work was done to port The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker to the Wii U was to use the game as a practice run and gain experience in HD game development. Nintendo considered showing the new Wii U Zelda game at E3, but chose to wait and will develop the game more before demonstrating it for the first time.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
