It stars Osomatsu, one of six identical sextuplets and star of the manga series Osomatsu-kun by Fujio Akatsuka. The manga had also been adapted into an anime TV anime some months prior to this game's release, and the game takes more of its elements from that anime.Osomatsu-kun took advantage of the graphical capabilities of the Genesis to include features such as parallax scrolling.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39987">Tensai Bakabon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/50065/1878056-osomatsu_kun_hachamecha_gekijou_cover.jpg</image></root>
