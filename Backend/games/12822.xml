Along with the original Mystique titles, PlayAround also released a number of their own adult-themed games. These games were released in pairs on special "double-end" cartridges.OverviewThe two games contained in this release are "Jungle Fever" and "Knight on the Town".Jungle FeverJungle Fever is a re-working of the PlayAround game     Burning Desire (only with gender roles reversed). The game features a naked woman attached to a helicopter, hovering over a burning fire. Your job is to put the fires out and rescue a man (in the most graphic way possible) while avoiding stones thrown by restless natives.Knight on the TownKnight on the Town is an original game created by PlayAround. It features a knight who must build a bridge across the moat of a castle in order to reach the buxom maiden in the tower. This may sound easy, but deadly   alligators and a really annoying  goblin make things increasingly difficult as more of the bridge is built.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7401">Bachelorette Party/Burning Desire</game><game id="13273">Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em/Lady in Wading</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/634968-b_junglefeverknightonthetown_back.jpg</image></root>
