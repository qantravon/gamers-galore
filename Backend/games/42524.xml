You are in charge of building new roads for the city. As it grows in all directions, new roads are always needed – and the existing ones need to be faster and wider! The residents demand well-maintained and modern pedestrian and bike paths too, as well as gas, water and power lines.

You’ll also be in control of maintenance, cleaning, and pothole repairs! In Roadworks Simulator you’ll need to deal with numerous different machines and handle complex building tasks. Career mode offers a wealth of challenges and Sandbox mode allows you to replay your favourite levels and aim for a new high score.

Take control of all these machines and more – pneumatic drill, walk-behind roller, dump truck, digger, loader, grader, road roller, paver and road sweeper.</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre></genres><image /></root>
