<root><id>32062</id><name>Floating Runner: Quest for the 7 Crystals</name><description>Gameplay in Floating Runner consists of 3d platforming around strange dream-like fantasy environments, shooting colored orbs at enemies, and finding treasure chests.    The Player can play as Lay, the boy, or Cress, the girl. There is no difference in gameplay between the two characters, other than the color of your shots.  Killing enemies will make them drop gems, which can also be found in treasure chests. The object of the game is to find and collect crystal shards in each level before a timer ticks down. Due to its horrible camera control and hard-to-judge shooting, the game is extremely hard.  The most prominent enemy in the game is basically a cat head with feet and a tail. For real, this game is kinda weird.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/91408/1430844-562799_83108_front.jpg</image></root>
