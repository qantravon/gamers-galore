You could name your  team and then choose players from a group of street kids hanging around in front of a tenement building. In either a parking lot or vacant block of land (chosen from the same select screen as the players), this one or two player game involved hazards (puddles, garbage bins) on the field and makeshift objects as bases.  </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23276/1645135-1544_1.jpg</image></root>
