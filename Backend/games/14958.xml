While it wasn't as popular as its predecessor Berzerk, some consider Frenzy the better game because of its greater depth.The mazes are randomly generated, and many of the walls can be destroyed by shooting them.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4010">Berzerk</game><game id="19516">Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters</game><game id="1144">Xybots</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/1805115-frenzy.jpg</image></root>
