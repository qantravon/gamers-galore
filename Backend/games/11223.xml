You take the role of a Marauder, an elite soldier of the Mobile Infantry. At the start of the game, the war is not going wellâ€¦ the bugs are rampaging across Hesperus - a planet perilously close to Earth. Hesperus is mostly a desert planet, and most fights take place in canyons or Federation bases. There aren't any vehicles you can use, but there are some mounted guns to occupy. The game includes clips from the film in cinematic motion picture and mission briefings.This screenshot helps signify the amount of bugs that can be active at any one fight.WeaponsMorita MK4----------Clip - Infi-neato2nd - GrenadesMorita MK2 Scatter------------------Clip - 160 / 162nd - Scatter shotMorita MK2 Grenade------------------Clip - 160 and 62nd - GrenadeTAC Shotgun-----------Clip - 20 / 52nd - Big shotMorita MK2 Scoped-----------------Clip - 1002nd - Zoom scopeMorita MK2 Carbine------------------Clip - 1502nd - Rapid fireM.L.R.------Clip - 502nd - Lock on fireRailgun-------Clip - 102nd - Zoom scopeMissile Launcher----------------Clip - 12nd - Lock on fire(Credit to dosec - IGN user)System requirementsMINIMUM:Operating System: Windows XP (SP2)Processor: 2.0GhzDVD speed: 8XRAM: 512MBHard Drive Space Required: 4GBDirect X Required: 9.0cVideo Card Required: 128MB Video Card with hardware vertex and pixel shadersRECOMMENDED:3.0Ghz CPU, 1024MB RA, GeForce 6800 Video CardNOTE: Starship Trooper's only supports the following video cards: Nvidia GeForce FX* 5600/5700/5800/5900 Series.
