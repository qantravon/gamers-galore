For example, if the sentence reads "The furious female robot stole the power crystal from the electric bread," the player can draw a picture of a robot holding a power crystal. Then the next player will write a sentence describing the picture the first player drew. The game continues as such indefinitely. </description><genres /><similar_games><game id="17553">Pictionary</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/956350-mixedmessages040709.jpg</image></root>
