The game was touted as a simplified role-playing game for entry level players. This was done to appeal to people not familiar with the role playing genre, so they could then "graduate" to Squaresoft's other RPGs like Final Fantasy IV or the then-upcoming Secret of Mana. The game was eventually released in its native Japan the following year with the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest.The game begins with the player controlling a young adult named Benjamin during an adventure to reclaim stolen crystals that represented the world's elemental powers. Unlike most of the Squaresoft RPGs of the time, there are no save points; players are allowed to save at any time. Party size is limited to two with Benjamin and a secondary character slot that rotates as the story progresses. In place of random battles, the player is able to see enemies on the field without the need of an item until a specific point in the game, but all enemies are stationary and incapable of roaming. Also unlike most RPGs, players are not allowed to free roam the world map, making the gameplay mostly linear. The player is required to follow guided paths, some of which could be blocked off until tasks are completed. Characters can jump, and use weapons outside of battle lending it an action-adventure type of gameplay also not found in other Final Fantasies. Mystic Quest includes many puzzles during the gameplay. Mystic Quest does not have the tradition of random enemies like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise, instead the player battles stationary enemies within dungeons. The player has the choice whether to attack the enemy or not, and can prepare beforehand with restorative items. The battle screen appears after approaching an enemy, turns are awarded back and forth with the fastest character getting the most turns. Players can battle, run, or "control" during the battle menu. Control can allow the player to manually control their allies or have the CPU control them. Battle is influenced by statistics like speed, accuracy, or attacking power. Characters gain experience points and gold pieces from winning battles. The game also includes battlefields that the player can enter and attempt to clear out ten battles against pre-set enemy encounters which rewards the player with a large cash prize or even a unique item.Soundtrack Soundtrack cover The Soundtrack for Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was composed by Yasuhiro Kawakami and Ryuji Sasai.01 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST I02 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST II03 - Mystic Quest04 - Hill of Fate05 - World06 - Beautiful Forest07 - Battle 108 - Victory Fanfare09 - City of Forest10 - Fossil Labyrinth11 - Battle 212 - Middle Tower13 - Shrine of Light14 - Rock Theme15 - Fanfare of Friendship16 - Dungeon of Ice17 - Dungeon of Waterfall18 - City of Fire - Faeria19 - Rock 'n' Roll20 - Lava Dome21 - City of Wind - Windaria22 - Mountain Range of Whirlwinds23 - The Crystal24 - Last Castle25 - Battle 326 - Mystic Ballad27 - Ending28 - RE-MIXTIC QUEST</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12462">Secret of the Stars</game><game id="2516">Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom</game><game id="5739">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</game><game id="3093">Breath of Fire II</game><game id="15629">Breath of Fire</game><game id="7197">Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</game><game id="19425">Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation</game><game id="8307">EarthBound</game><game id="20389">The 7th Saga</game><game id="1164">Dragon Warrior I &amp; II</game><game id="17419">Kouryu Densetsu Villgust: Kieta Shoujo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363830-snes_finalfantasymysticquest.jpg</image></root>
