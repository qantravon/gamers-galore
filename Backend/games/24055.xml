They travel into cavern, meet up with the 8-bit NES version of the Spelunker character and proceed to interview him. They then go on to tease him about the many ways the HD Spelunker can be killed and show him photos which really alarms him, obviously. When each photo comes up on the screen, it's acompanied with a 'you just died' jingle from the game. 8-bit Spelunker then proceeds to get himself killed and blinks off the screen, with the original 8-bit version of the jingle playing. This whole skit is a knowing jab at the reputation of the series for being extremely difficult. Later on, a ghost turns up behind Kuro and Spelunker returns, shooting both Kuro and the ghost who both blink and disappear with the death jingle once again chiming.Playstation HomeItems for Home are awarded as bonuses in the game.
