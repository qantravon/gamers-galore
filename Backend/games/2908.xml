<root><id>2908</id><name>Quasimodo</name><description>Quasimodo was originally programmed for the Atari 400/800 series by Jon Atack in 1983. It was also brought to the Commodore 64 in a port by Mark Bigelow in 1984.  The Atari computer version of Quasimodo is more advanced than the C64 release, audiovisually speaking, though the basic gameplay--recovering jewels by swinging from bell ropes and tossing rocks at archers--remains the same across both versions. The Atari version shows a ghost stealing the crown jewels at the opening, and you use a teleporter to return to the game's interactive title screen to replace the jewels as you collect them. The C64 version replaces all this by putting a ladder that leads down to an area where the jewels can be placed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5724">Crackpots</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/853129-1152246306_00.png</image></root>
