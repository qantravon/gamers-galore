It was released on September 28, 2011 on DSiWare and was available for free for a limited time. It was developed by Grezzo, the company also responsible for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D.GameplayThe Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition is a multiplayer take on the traditional Zelda formula. Each player controls a Link with a different colored tunic and work to complete randomly generated levels while competing for rupees.ChangesIt is largely the same multiplayer mode originally included in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  Four Swords, but certain changes had to be made to adapt it to a new platform and account for the absence of A Link to the Past in this version. The most noticeable change is that the game can now be played single-player, where the original was multiplayer-only. Changes have been made to the game to make this possible. Additionally, the Master Sword and Hurrican Spin are now obtained by beating the Realm of Memories and Hero's Trial, rather than unlocking them in A Link to the Past.New ContentFour Swords Anniversary Edition also includes three new levels available after the game is beaten. These Realm of Memories levels reproduce areas from the original Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, and Link's Awakening, including their visual styles. There is also a Hero's Trial.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35572">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/143154/2088645-the_legend_of_zelda___four_swords_anniversary_edition__logo_.png</image></root>
