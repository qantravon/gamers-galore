Alias itself is considered a canon part of the story told in the television show and takes place in between episode 19 and 20 of season 2 of the show. Despite being generally poorly received by critics a number of the most prominent people in the creation of the TV show did work on the game. Many of the actors from the TV show did voice work for the game,  Michael Giacchino who composed music for the TV show created the score for the game and the game's story was written by Breen Frazier, writer of the TV show. Most of the game dealt with espionage operations carried out by the protagonist.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11247">Kaan: Barbarian's Blade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285620-box_alias.png</image></root>
