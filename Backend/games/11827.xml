Not based on any particular film in the A Nightmare on Elm Street series, it centers around a teen on Elm Street who is trying to stop the dream serial killer Freddy Krueger from being resurrected.The object of the game is to roam around Elm Street and collect all of Freddy's bones. Enemies include creatures that weren't featured in the movies, and are instead horror game cliches. They include spiders, bats, skeletons, and ghosts. As the player collects the bones, the "dream world" can be entered and the enemies get harder, dealing more damage. Each stage ends in a boss battle with one of Freddy's body parts, with the fully formed Freddy Krueger serving as the final boss.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21482">Friday the 13th</game><game id="2061">Halloween</game><game id="7237">Friday The 13th: The Computer Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361104-nes_nightmareonelmstreet.jpg</image></root>
