In this game you will start off with Tarzan as a little boy, then later on he will grow into an adult. You learn your basic jungle skills from Terk. You need to help turn those basic skills into something amazing in order to beat the evil Queen  La.  The Queen wants to use the jungle for horrible things, she wants to take it over and do what ever she wants with it.  You are with Jane and Professor Porter and you have to try to stop her. You need to search  the Lost City of Opar and rescue dinosaur eggs from poachers. GameplayUnderwaterCollecting bananas along the way will help you a lot in this game. Collect a lot of them and you will earn yourself an extra life. Some levels you swim underwater, but the problem is that Tarzan cannot stay down there forever. If he is underwater too long he will drown. So be sure that you give him a chance to breathe. Throughout levels there are checkpoints just in case you die. They are there so that you don't have to start the whole level over again, which could have been very frustrating. There are a total of 5 'worlds' that you have to play through. Each one of them have 5 levels within them. They vary from being on top of the jungle to under the water, so there is plenty of variety.EnemiesBaboonThese guys will not let you escape unless you defeat them.
