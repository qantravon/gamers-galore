The goal is to play Pachinko in various machines found in Pachinko parlors across Japan, attempting to reach a Pachinko ball target (the total grows each time the player successfully fires a ball into a point-scoring zone) before a time limit expires before they move onto the next machine.</description><genres><genre id="49">Gambling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38605">Pachicom</game><game id="39826">Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun</game><game id="40566">Pachiokun 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360118-pachinko_gp_fds.jpg</image></root>
