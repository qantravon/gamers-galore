The humans call on their military and diplomatic strength, but are surprised when a scientist offers his new AI as a solution. Knack is a metal combination of floating objects that form a anthropomorphic being.While Knack is battling goblins, the goblin leader questions him on why he would fight for humans when he is not one himself.Meanwhile, the military leader of the humans has turned traitor and presumably begun genetic or robotic experiments in making stronger soldiers.GameplayKnack has the player switching between two forms; one small and one large. When small, Knack runs around rooms and areas, seemingly relying on stealth. When large, Knack crushes his enemies with might and melee combos. While the outside areas appear more like a traditional third-person open world, the inside areas take a 2D/3D limited perspective, single camera approach.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543315-box_knack.png</image></root>
