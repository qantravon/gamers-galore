Nonetheless, the switch wasn't enough to remove the game from criticism, failing to create any kind of appeal for anyone outside of Evil Dead's pre-established cult audience.   As  Ash Williams, players will traverse the town of Dearborn, Michigan in various incarnations (1695, 1863, Evil Dearborn) and leading thus to an epilogue.       Bruce Campbell returns to the give life to the      voice of everyone's favorite       one-liner spewing,    "Deadite"-smiting hero,        Ash.  Weapons           Boomstick: An upgradeable starting weapon.           Chainsaw: Can be upgraded with a diamond pickup.
