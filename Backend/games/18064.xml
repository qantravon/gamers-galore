He wrote, "...This is nothing more than Strider for Super NES except with the added option of two-player simultaneous play and the option to play as a woman warrior... The game could have been longer, but it's still a great trip! The warrior color change is a big plus".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12558">Strider</game><game id="6496">Strider 2</game><game id="29497">OSman</game><game id="31659">Moon Diver</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2364643-snes_runsaber_de.jpg</image></root>
