Story missions help the game along, constantly getting harder as it progresses. It also has the unusual mechanic of not having Superman dealing with a lifebar, but with Metropolis dealing with one instead. You are forced to deal with some of Superman's major enemies and their attempts to destroy Metropolis.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5614">Spider-Man 3</game><game id="20762">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</game><game id="8322">Spider-Man: The Movie</game><game id="12305">Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</game><game id="16118">Superman: The Man of Steel</game><game id="8423">Superman: Shadow of Apokolips</game><game id="16327">Justice League Heroes</game><game id="20530">Iron Man</game><game id="19865">The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</game><game id="20891">The Incredible Hulk</game><game id="26073">The Batman Strength in Numbers</game><game id="7593">Ultimate Spider-Man</game><game id="30399">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2280513-box_smr.png</image></root>
