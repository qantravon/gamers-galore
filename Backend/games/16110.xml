This sequel fared no better, with players praising the visual style and admitting that improvements had been made to the fighting system, but complaining about nearly every other facet of the game. The story of the first title was continued, picking up right where Rise of the Robots left off, and continuing the story of Coton the cyborg. There were 23 characters in total, some available from the start and others hidden. Several new robots were added, but all of the old ones remained, each being upgraded with new moves and abilities. The game also introduced a palette-swap mechanic, where the player could essentially change the color of any robot, with up to 256 available colors.The fighting system of the game, despite the poor reception from critics, was technically very much improved. More combos were added, a counter system was introduced, all of the fighters were given several new special moves, and every robot had a super move that could be unleashed once an energy bar was full. One of the features heavily touted before release was the inclusion of 'Termination' moves, very similar to the Fatalities of Mortal Kombat, however many gamers were left disappointed upon purchasing the game to discover there were very few actual Termination moves in the game, and most of them were not up to the standard of MK's fatalities.As mentioned earlier, Brian May, who contributed to the soundtrack of the first game, returned with another track for Rise 2 entitled 'Cyborg'.StoryThe story picks up from the end of Rise of the Robots. Coton is defeated by the Supervisor, and assimilated into her being, granting her even greater intelligence, and the ability to upgrade all of her existing robot guards (this explained how the robots from the previous game were all improved in Rise 2). For a time, it is feared that Coton is lost for good, with the scientists who deployed him eventually resorting to unleashing the virus from the original game. This virus infects all robots in the city, including most of the Supervisor's guard, causing them to turn against one another, vastly depleting the Supervisor's resources. It is at this time, we see Coton return, making the most of the chaos to slip away unnoticed, uploading himself into a new robot.The game is left open at this point, perhaps in anticipation of another sequel, or to let the player draw their own conclusions. Coton is left with the choice of escaping the facility altogether, or fighting the Supervisor one last time.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14669">Virtua Fighter Animation</game><game id="3744">Def Jam: Fight for NY</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="20678">Soulcalibur IV</game><game id="12411">Soulcalibur</game><game id="11822">Soulcalibur II</game><game id="9855">Soulcalibur III</game><game id="11945">Soulcalibur Legends</game><game id="16690">Def Jam: Icon</game><game id="2410">Def Jam: Vendetta</game><game id="22083">Def Jam: Fight for NY: The Takeover</game><game id="707">Virtua Fighter 5</game><game id="41">Virtua Fighter 2</game><game id="19766">Virtua Fighter 3</game><game id="15584">Virtua Fighter</game><game id="4313">Virtua Fighter 4</game><game id="4891">Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution</game><game id="13185">SEGA AGES 2500 Vol.16: Virtua Fighter 2</game><game id="20749">Virtua Fighter 5 R</game><game id="5238">Battle Arena Toshinden</game><game id="2895">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</game><game id="1513">Battle Arena Toshinden Remix</game><game id="3323">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</game><game id="11269">Battle Arena Toshinden Ultimate Revenge Attack</game><game id="11293">Battle Arena Toshinden 4</game><game id="20689">Tekken 6</game><game id="18753">Tekken 5</game><game id="14684">Tekken 4</game><game id="11189">Tekken 3</game><game id="10387">Tekken 2</game><game id="10081">Tekken</game><game id="11606">Tekken: Dark Resurrection</game><game id="10162">Tekken Tag Tournament</game><game id="3243">Tekken Advance</game><game id="20449">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</game><game id="2178">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</game><game id="1434">Mortal Kombat 3</game><game id="11843">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</game><game id="8279">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</game><game id="6421">Mortal Kombat 4</game><game id="6588">Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</game><game id="10651">Mortal Kombat: Unchained</game><game id="4652">Mortal Kombat Gold</game><game id="383">Mortal Kombat: Deception</game><game id="8325">Mortal Kombat Advance</game><game id="2760">Art of Fighting</game><game id="7751">Art of Fighting Anthology</game><game id="13327">Art of Fighting 2</game><game id="8867">Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior</game><game id="8680">Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX</game><game id="11802">Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams</game><game id="4762">Street Fighter Alpha Anthology</game><game id="19134">Street Fighter Alpha 2</game><game id="10989">Street Fighter EX3</game><game id="20736">Street Fighter EX2</game><game id="19799">The King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood</game><game id="20734">Street Fighter EX</game><game id="11370">Street Fighter EX2 Plus</game><game id="11976">The King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood</game><game id="12518">Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha</game><game id="20735">Street Fighter EX Plus</game><game id="20456">Street Fighter IV</game><game id="243">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</game><game id="8161">Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting</game><game id="1096">Street Fighter II': Champion Edition</game><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game><game id="20616">Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</game><game id="11156">X-Men vs. Street Fighter</game><game id="6665">Super Street Fighter II</game><game id="1251">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</game><game id="21948">Street Fighter III: New Generation</game><game id="22305">Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact</game><game id="9726">Super Street Fighter II: Turbo Revival</game><game id="16444">Eternal Champions</game><game id="8021">Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side</game><game id="19200">Fatal Fury Special</game><game id="17194">Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1</game><game id="14929">Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers</game><game id="939">Real Bout Fatal Fury</game><game id="951">Real Bout Fatal Fury Best Collection</game><game id="2396">Fatal Fury</game><game id="6708">Fatal Fury: First Contact</game><game id="8285">Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</game><game id="11400">Fatal Fury 2</game><game id="13463">Real Bout Fatal Fury Special</game><game id="19936">Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory!</game><game id="10674">Garou: Mark of the Wolves</game><game id="16939">International Karate +</game><game id="421">International Karate 2000</game><game id="4747">World Karate Championship</game><game id="20100">Power Stone</game><game id="3712">Power Stone 2</game><game id="12645">SEGA AGES 2500 Vol.24: Last Bronx -
