You basically fill in your initial measurements and heart rates and the system then will calculate a program to work for you.There is a Guest mode that will skip this set-up mode for friends/family to use.Although this product does not use any of the Wii balance boards or controllers it is better for that giving true work out steps and stretches. There is an option at the start to add in hand weights and balls to the routine which is then selected in durations of 15 minutes to suit you schedule.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre><genre id="44">Fitness</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="20503">Wii Fit</game><game id="21098">Wii Sports Resort</game><game id="24140">Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009</game><game id="26788">My Fitness</game><game id="28433">The Biggest Loser</game><game id="24481">EA Sports Active</game><game id="31743">Zumba Fitness</game><game id="22415">Yourself Fitness</game><game id="36440">Billy's Bootcamp</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7900/825592-my_fitness_coach.jpg</image></root>
