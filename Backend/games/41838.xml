In the main game mode, the player must capture control nodes scattered across a map, and retain more nodes than the enemy player, gaining enough points over time to win the match. Command &amp; Conquer 4 utilizes class-based gameplay as well as some RPG elements.</description><genres><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/2483-2.jpg</image></root>
