<root><id>19864</id><name>Final Fantasy Tactics</name><description>OverviewFinal Fantasy Tactics is a strategy role-playing game that was released by Square Enix (formerly Squaresoft) for the Playstation in January of 1998. While the game is part of the Final Fantasy franchise, its gameplay pays more homage to the tactical RPG Tactics Ogre than any of its brethren. However, the game retains a number of Final Fantasy related features such as chocobos, magic and a job system, incorporating these into the turn-based strategy premise. The game was re-released with an enhanced feature set for the PlayStation Portable in 2007 under the title Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions.GameplayFinal Fantasy Tactics' gameplay revolves primarily around the strength of its battle system. Most of the time in game is spent fighting either scripted story-driven battles or random encounters. The rest is devoted to character development, negotiating the world map and following the game's labyrinthine plot.Battle SystemFinal Fantasy Tactics' battle system takes the familiar traits of the core series' battle mechanics and mixes them with a traditional turn-based-strategy style of gameplay. Battles are fought in 3D isometric environments, with both the player's troop of soldiers and the band of enemies represented by 2D sprites commonly referred to as "units".World MapBetween battles, like most Final Fantasy games, Final Fantasy Tactics provides the player with a world map to traverse. FF Tactics' 2D world map functions more as a menu, as the player does not have active control over the on-screen character. Instead, the character can be moved to any available location on the world map using an icon. There are two primary types of locations on FF Tactics' world map, the first of which is towns. When the player visits a town, he or she has the option to:Visit the local Tavern, catch up on recent Gossip and possibly undertake an Errand.Stop at the Outfitter to buy and sell weapons, armor and other items.Pass by the Warriors' Guild to recruit new soldiers.Exclusive to certain locations, visit the Poachers' Den to buy poached items at reduced prices.Job SystemThe Job System.Like most Final Fantasy games, there is a unique system in place that determines how your magic, abilites, and stats work. The basis of combat revolves around the Job System, a class-based concept that has you changing jobs, and using said actions of that class on the battlefield, which will yield you Job Points (JP). As you gain JP you will level up your specific class of character, as well as gain the right to unlock new abilities, by expending these points. Familiar character classes from past Final Fantasy games appear in this game as jobs, including Wizards, Priests, Thieves, Lancers, and Summoners. Most new characters start out as either a Squire or a Chemist, and work their way up the proverbial ladder, to unlock new Jobs -- and likewise -- new bone-crushing skills.JobsSquireSquireSquire is the base job from which all physical classes grow. While their abilities allow them to perform a wide variety of tasks, they are not particularly adept at any of them. However, every character will want to spend enough time in the job to obtain the JP Boost skill that increases all JP earned by 50%.Prerequisites: NoneWeapons: Axes, Flails, Knives, SwordsArmor: Hats, ClothesMove/Jump Rate: 4/3Evasion Rate: 5%Active Stats: Phys - C; Mag - D; HP - C; MP - D; Spd - CGrowth Rate: Phys - D; Mag - D; HP - C; MP - F; Spd - FFundaments (job skill)NameDescriptionRangeAreaDelayJPFocusIncreases physical attack power by 1 until end of battle01Now300RushPhysical attack with high chance of knock-back11Now80StoneRanged physical attack41Now90SalveRemoves Blind, Poison, Silence11Now150ReactionNameDescriptionTriggerJPCounter TackleAttacks with Rush regardless of abilityPhysical attack180SupportNameDescriptionJPEquip AxesEquip Axes regardless of Job170BeastmasterGrants adjacent friendly monsters within 3H an additional ability200DefendAdds the Defend command, doubles evasion rate until next turn50JP BoostIncreases the amount of JP earned by 50%250MovementNameDescriptionJPMove +1Increases maximum movement range by 1200ChemistChemistUnlike most Final Fantasy games, Chemists are the only job in Final Fantasy Tactics with the skill to use items. As the base class for all spell-casters, their physical abilities are somewhat lacking.

Unable to convince her brother of the truth, she defects to protect her latest target Ramza in hopes that he will help her put an end to Barrington's evil once and for all.SkyseerRapha's Skyseer abilities are unique magic attacks that, unlike regular magic, deal the same damage regardless of her Faith and the Faith of her target. Also unlike regular magic are the multiple random factors that determine how effective her spells are. While most area-of-effect spells strike every tile within their radius once, however her spells strike a random number of tiles a random number of times. She can inflict heavy damage just as easily as she can completely miss her target.Weapons: Poles, StavesArmor: Hats, Clothes, RobesMove/Jump Rate: 3/3Evade Rate: 10%Active Stats: Phys - C; Mag - C; HP - C; MP - C; Spd - BGrowth Rate: Phys - C; Mag - F; HP - C; MP - B; Spd - FSky Mantra (job skill)NameDescriptionRangeAreaDelayJPHeaven's WrathMagic attack that deals Lightning damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times423100AshuraMagic attack that deals Fire damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times424200Adamantine BladeMagic attack that deals Wind damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times425300MaelstromMagic attack that deals Water damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times426400Celestial VoidMagic attack, inflicts Blind, Confuse, Poison, Silence, Sleep, Slow, Toad, strikes random tiles 1-10 times425500DivinityMagic attack that deals water damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times427600Marach GalthenaServing for years as a member of the Khamja assassination team, Marach refused to believe the accusations of evil his twin Rapha levied against their apparent benefactor the Grand Duke Barrington.

After being mortally wounded protecting Rapha, he is mysteriously revived by the Scorpio Zodiac Stone and finds himself honor bound alongside his sister to aid Ramza in his travels.NetherseerThe opposite of standard magic, Marach's spells grow more powerful the lower the Faith is and his target and himself. While this gives him the potential to do incredible damage, it also makes him difficult to use effectively. This is only exacerbated by the fact that his spells strike randomly within their radius, making every attack with him a gamble.Weapons: Poles, RodsArmor: Hats, Clothes, RobesMove/Jump Rate: 4/3Evade Rate: 8%Active Stats: Phys - C; Mag - C; HP - C; MP - B; Spd - BGrowth Rate: Phys - C; Mag - F; HP - B; MP - B; Spd - FNether Mantra (job skill)NameDescriptionRangeAreaDelayJPHell's WrathMagic attack that deals Lightning damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times423100Nether AshuraMagic attack that deals Fire damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times424200Nether BladeMagic attack that deals Wind damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times425300Nether MaelstromMagic attack that deals Water damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times426400Corporeal VoidMagic attack, inflicts Blind, Confuse, Poison, Silence, Sleep, Slow, Toad, strikes random tiles 1-10 times425500ImpietyMagic attack that deals Earth damage, strikes random tiles 1-10 times427600Cidolfus Orlandeau (T.G.

Aided by Ramza's childhood friend Delita as part of a greater plot, his death is faked allowing him to escape prison and follow Ramza on his journey.Sword SaintA master in the truest sense, Orlandeau has access to the skills of all the other major swordsmen in Ivalice.

A curse from the Celebrant meant for Beowulf transformed Reis into a dragon, and as she fled he quickly followed. Tracking her to the mining town of Gollund, Beowulf encounters Ramza and his party on their hunt for the rumored holy dragon. As they are beset by monsters, they are forced to join forces to avoid being overwhelmed.TemplarBeowulf's Templar abilities function very similar to those of a Mystic, inflicting a variety of powerful status ailments on his target.

As a side effect she lost her memory and, confused and disoriented, she began to wander Ivalice. Her travels eventually led her to the Gollund Coal Mine where she took up residence. With rumors spreading of the mine's holy dragon infestation, Ramza and Beowulf arrive just in time to rescue Reis from the Archaeodaemon Syneugh.Beowulf is determined to free Reis from her curse and together with Ramza, manages to acquire the Cancer Zodiac Stone. Through the stone's magic she is restored to her original human form and, indebted to Ramza for his aid, she and Beowulf agree to stay with the group to lend their aid whenever possible.Holy DragonAs a Holy Dragon, Reis has incredibly high health, mobility, and attack power.

Every character in the game has a Zodiac sign attributed to them, and this affects their ability to interact with other units on the battlefield. A character's Zodiac sign is often critical in determining the amount of damage an attack will cause, the likelihood of success of certain abilities (such as Steal or Time Magicks), and their susceptibility to attacks from other units. Taking Zodiac signs into account is often a crucial aspect of battle in Final Fantasy Tactics, to ensure that maximum damage is dealt to a threat without endangering any weak units unnecessarily.StoryThe game is a refreshing break from other RPGs of this era, as the storyline takes a fairly mature turn, although the original version of the game was said to be fairly confusing due to translation issues. Final Fantasy Tactics takes place in the fictional kingdom of Ivalice, which is no stranger to war. The game follows Ramza Beoulve, a young man that is part of a royal bloodline. He shortly finds himself stuck in a family feud after his father's death, and the throne of the kingdom is at stake.At the center of this plot is not only Ramza, but his childhood friend Delita Hyral. While Ramza was born illegitimately, he was brought up by his noble father. In contrast, Delita and his sister Teta were both lowborn. Despite their differences, Ramza and Delita view each other as equals and remain close due to their outlook on friendship. Things become more complicated, however, as Delita is cast out by the Beoulves, and in response takes his own path, which separates the two friends.SettingThe PSP version features animated cutscenes.The story takes place in the fictional kingdom of Ivalice, located in a peninsula surrounded by sea on the north, west and south, with a headland south of the landmass. Its geography features ranging landscapes, from plains to mountain ranges to deserts and forests. Ivalice is heavily populated by human beings; though, intelligent monsters are sporadically spread throughout. Even though magic is predominant in the land, ruins and artifacts indicate that past populaces had relied on machinery such as airships and robots.Ivalice is a kingdom of seven territories, united under a monarch. Ivalice's neighbors are the kingdom of Ordalia in the east and Romanda, a military nation to the north. While the three nations share common royal bloodlines, major wars have taken place between them. An influential religious institution known as the Murond Glabados Church heads the dominant faith, centering around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora.The story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known as the Fifty Years War, and is facing economic problems and political strife. Adding to its problems is the recent death of the king, whose heir is only an infant. A regent is needed to rule in place of the prince, and the kingdom is split between Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince Larg, symbolized by the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is a revelation by the game's fictional historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church.The setting is based around this character, named by default as Ramza, and revolves around his early life and the future conflicts he faced while the events that changed the kingdom unfold.CharactersRamza BeoulveCentral to the plot of the game are two main characters, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Hyral. The two characters were childhood friends even though both were born of differing social classes. (Ramza as a noble / Delita as a commoner) Both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. As the story progressed, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoints on life. Delita sought to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams; while, Ramza believed in justice and honor regardless of name and class.The game's plot is portrayed through the eyes of Ramza Beoulve (main player character). His exploits in the war introduced him to a number of characters with their own roles and agenda concerning the war and the fictional world Ivalice. The most prominent factions at the beginning of the story are those of Prince Goltana and Prince Larg. Both are nobles that sought to obtain control of the throne by being the guardian to the monarch's young heir and were thus engaged in a war. The story progresses to include characters from the Murond Glabados Church, which have been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question.Players are able to recruit generic player characters from towns and customize them using the job system of the Final Fantasy series. Several battles feature friendly A.I. controlled special "Guest" characters which may be recruited depending on the progression of the story. The special characters normally have a unique class initially assigned, but they can still can be customized into the generic classes. Aside from main playable characters, the developers have also incorporated cameo roles from other Squaresoft games.
