<root><id>24535</id><name>Crash Time II</name><description>DemoA     demo for Crash Time II (title for most regions except Germany) was released in late November 2008 on Xbox LIVE Marketplace for Europe. The full game was released at retail in November 2008 for Germany (known as Burning Wheels). There was a limited English release in other parts of Europe and in the US, published by    Tommo, it is known under the title "Autobahn Polizei", abandoning the title that would indicate it is a sequel to the original Crash Time.If the language of the dashboard is set to English (Xbox 360 version), an imported Burning Wheels will play as Crash Time II and have English voice acting. Having the language set to German will of course show the original German dialogue and alternate logos.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="1321">L.
