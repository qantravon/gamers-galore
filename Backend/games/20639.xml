When the game was first announced, most people laughed at the idea of plugging a small Gibson guitar into the Nintendo DS, but Guitar Hero: On Tour is actually one of the most innovative games released for the Nintendo DS.The game comes in a package which includes the Guitar Grip which is a device which plugs into the Gameboy Advance Slot on the Nintendo DS and features four colored buttons, a strap which is attached to the Guitar Grip to make playing more comfortable, a Pick Stylus which is basically as stylus which looks like a guitar pick and is used for strumming and of course, the game itself.To play Guitar Hero: On Tour, you hold the Nintendo DS on it's side, and slot your hand into the strap on the Guitar Grip. Your fingers will sit on the green, red, yellow and blue buttons and you use your other hand for strumming on the touch screen using the Pick Stylus.The game plays much like the console versions of Guitar Hero, where you strum notes and press the correct colored button as it crosses the note on the screen. It features a Career mode, a Guitar Duels mode, Quick Play, Practice, and  various local multiplayer modes.  There are two version of the games setlsit one for the (NA/UK/AUS version)  one for the Euro release (these tracks are noted in italics where needed)    Setlist Tier 1: Subway  OK Go - "Do What You Want" Blink-182 - "All the Small Things" No Doubt - "Spiderwebs" Jet - "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" Twisted Sister - "We're Not Gonna Take It" (Encore) Europe - "Rock The Nite" (EU Exclusive)** Tier 2: Rooftop  Smash Mouth - "All Star Nirvana - "Breed" Rick Springfield - "Jessie's Girl" Pat Benatar - "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" Maroon 5 - "This Love" Beatsteaks - "Monster"***     Tier 3: Parade  Los Lonely Boys - "Heaven" Bloc Party - "Helicopter" The Doobie Brothers - "China Grove" Kiss - "Rock and Roll All Nite"* Daughtry featuring Slash - "What I Want" Tokio Hotel - "Monsoon"    (EU Exclusive)***  iselle K - "Ca Me Vexe"*        Tier  4: Greek Arena  Steve Miller Band - "Jet Airliner"* Santana - "Black Magic Woman"* Stray Cats - "Stray Cat Strut" ZZ Top - "La Grange"* Skid Row - "Youth Gone Wild"* Heroes del Silencio - "Avalancha"    (EU Exclusive)   Tier 5: Battleship  Ozzy Osbourne - "I Don't Wanna Stop" Incubus - "Anna Molly" Red Hot Chili Peppers - "Knock Me Down" Stevie Ray Vaughan - "Pride and Joy" Lynyrd Skynyrd - "I Know a Little"* Bonus  Freezepop - "I Am Not Your Gameboy"* - indicates cover version Setlist (European version) Tier 1: Subway  OK Go - "Do What You Want" Blink-182 - "All the Small Things" No Doubt - "Spiderwebs" Jet - "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" Twisted Sister - "We're Not Gonna Take It" Tier 2: Rooftop  Smash Mouth - "All Star" Nirvana - "Breed" Pat Benatar - "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" Maroon 5 - "This Love" Tier 3: Parade  Bloc Party - "Helicopter" Mademoiselle K - "Ca Me Vexe"* Kiss - "Rock and Roll All Nite"* Santana - "Black Magic Woman"* Tier 4: Greek Arena  Europe - "Rock the Night"* Stray Cats - "Stray Cat Strut" ZZ Top - "La Grange"* Skid Row - "Youth Gone Wild"* Tier 5: Battleship  Ozzy Osbourne - "I Don't Wanna Stop" Incubus - "Anna Molly" Red Hot Chili Peppers - "Knock Me Down" Stevie Ray Vaughan - "Pride and Joy" Lynyrd Skynyrd - "I Know a Little"* Bonus  Freezepop - "I Am Not Your Gameboy"* - indicates cover version</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20808">Rock Band Track Pack Volume 1</game><game id="9860">Rock Band</game><game id="20714">Rock Band 2</game><game id="18573">Jam Sessions</game><game id="21894">Imagine Girl Band</game><game id="22167">Synthesia</game><game id="22625">pop'n music 8</game><game id="22623">pop'n music 7</game><game id="22622">pop'n music 6</game><game id="22621">pop'n music 5</game><game id="22619">pop'n music 4</game><game id="22618">pop'n music 3</game><game id="22617">pop'n music 2</game><game id="21655">pop'n music</game><game id="20635">Rock Revolution</game><game id="22176">Taiko no Tatsujin DS</game><game id="23613">Guitar Praise: Solid Rock</game><game id="25421">Rock Band Unplugged</game><game id="23939">AC/DC Live: Rock Band</game><game id="24328">PopStar Guitar</game><game id="27934">Lady Gaga Revenge</game><game id="35165">Sequence</game><game id="31764">DJ Hero 3D</game><game id="38479">Jam Sessions 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2491502-box_ghot.png</image></root>
