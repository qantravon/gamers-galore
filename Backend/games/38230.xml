It's quickly established that the ship has reached its destination; it is in the solar system where it was headed, but the rest of the crew has for unknown reasons disappeared, and Rachel sets out to find out what happened to them.The titular J.U.L.I.A. is the spaceship AI, which at first directs Rachel to repair the ship and acquire upgrades to help in the search for survivors and what actually happened to the crew. The hunt turns into a mystery investigation that goes to every planet in the solar system and Rachel has to puzzle together a timeline leading up to her waking up.J.U.L.I.A. is a point-and-click game, but you do not actually control the main character. Instead, you are put into the shoes of Rachel, who gets video imagery from the planets where the drama has already played out, and directing the ship robot Mobot to investigate different situations on the surface. Rachel remains on the ship the entire game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/75558/2199455-box2.jpg</image></root>
