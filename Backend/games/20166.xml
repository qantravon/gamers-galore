<root><id>20166</id><name>NHL '94</name><description>OverviewNHL 94 is a vertically oriented ice hockey simulation based on the game engine behind NHLPA 93. NHL 94 makes playable all NHL teams (active at the end of the 1993 season), complete with robust (though incomplete) player rosters, in addition to the East and West conference All-Star teams. Various players attributes (e.g. speed, aggression, shot) are ranked based on a 100 point system and affect the way players perform in the game.New Features IntroducedThese features were added from EA Sports previous game NHLPA 93:Goalie ControlShootout GamePenalty ShotsBench and Board Checks3 or 4 Player Compatible with Adapter (5 players on SNES)1992-93 Player Ratings  RostersVariable Player Ratings when on Hot/Cold StreaksSave Player Records for each playerSave User Standings and RecordsOne-times and Special Moves by Selected PlayersNew Player StatsFlip PassesReverse-Angle ReplayClear the zone while killing penaltiesAutomatic Line Changes (can manually change lines at play stoppage)Tougher Computer DefenseTougher GoaliesComputer Shooting Scoring MovesPlayer and Team CardsPlayer Profiles with 144 Player PicturesLogan Organ Music matches Home ArenaTeam logos at center iceNew crowd animationsNo fighting or bloodPeriod StatsMore kinds of game statsTwo expansion teams (Anaheim and Florida)InnovationNHL 94 has been lauded as one of the best sports games ever made. It improved on the innovative NHLPA 93 engine, adding smoother sprite animation and a host of new gameplay mechanics. Perhaps the most important of the newly introduced gameplay features was the ability to perform a one-timer. (For non-initiated, a one-timer is when you pass the puck to a player and the intended recipient shoots the puck immediately, without pause.) The one-timer proved to be one of the most accessible scoring options in the game. Scoring was also made easier by the inclusion of a more robust deke mechanic with NHL 94 (at least in the SNES version of the game). In addition, gamers were also able to save their user records.NHL 94 also evolved from its predecessor by reducing the frequency of slap-shot goals scored through the goalieâ€™s five-hole and stopping the ability to run into the goalie and have the puck your player was carrying drift into the net. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature included in NHLPA 93 and omitted from NHL 94 was the ability to fight your opponents. Fighting returned with NHL 95.Game ModesRegular SeasonPlayoffsBest of Seven PlayoffsShootoutExhibitionNHL Teams  RankingsThe following is a chart of the 26 NHL teams featured in NHL 94 and their rankings, strengths and weakness.

The main menu looks rather different from one version to the next, the SNES version adopting a much more basic design. There are also slight graphical differences during gameplay. Possibly the most significant difference is that the SNES version will not track players' statistics from one game to the next (for example, to see which player on your team is leading in goals scored during playoff mode).Ron Barr's QuotesWelcome to a sold out {insert arena], home of the [insert home team]Hi I'm Ron Barr for EA Sports... and in goal tonight [goalie name] for [team] and [goalie name] for [opposing team]For [team name], [player name] is on a hot streak, but [player name] is on a cold streak.The [arena] crowd record is [number] db.Hit the Start button to begin, Use the A and C to cycle through menus.Lately [team name] has been playing well ...

Ed Semrad wrote, "... a must for any sports fan. EA is getting closer to making the ultimate hockey game". Mike Weigand wrote, "...Loads of new features have been added to NHL '94. Now there are four players with 2-on-2, or any combination you may like. Other new features include real players' stats from the previous season, including faces and streaks. They also have the new logos and each team's rink music. The level of detail, from the crowd scenes to the control is great".</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="39">Hockey</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14125">NHL Stanley Cup</game><game id="22497">Brett Hull Hockey</game><game id="10382">Elitserien 95</game><game id="26553">TV Sports Hockey</game><game id="7106">Madden NFL '94</game><game id="30852">ESPN National Hockey Night</game><game id="5450">NHLPA Hockey '93</game><game id="13699">Super Slap Shot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1614/787783-nhl94_gen_us.jpg</image></root>
