The Warehouse Game</name><description>This Soukoban-style puzzle game consists of 160 stages, with every ten stages being unlocked after the prior ten stages are completed. The game allows a single-step undo option, but keeps track of the total steps taken for a given puzzle, and progress is saved through passwords. It also has a level editor. </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17545">Sokoban</game><game id="18336">SokoMania</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/1171795-586456_39028_front.jpg</image></root>
