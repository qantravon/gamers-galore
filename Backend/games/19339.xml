<root><id>19339</id><name>1080Â° Avalanche</name><description>Overview1080 Avalanche is a snowboarding game for the Nintendo Gamecube, released in 2003. It was developed by Nintendo's in-house development studio, NST. The gameplay is mostly racing oriented, and unlike SSX focuses very little on tricks. Even when tricks are possible to do in the game, the player is not rewarded for doing them, and therefore the player is discouraged to do them. The tricks in the game are very similar to SSX, but the user controls them with the bumpers, and not button combination. The game also features 2 player play. In addition, the game was one of the only games that the Gamecube ever supported to go online.Long DevelopmentThe game suffered from a long development time, being firstly announced in 1998, and was originally announced to the Nintendo 64 platform. When the original developer left field failed to finalize the game, the work shifted on to NST. Most fans presumed that NST completely rewrote the game because it was nothing like the original. Later NST released information that the game, while being in different direction from the original 1080 snowboarding game, was indeed based on the original version.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="33">Snowboarding/Skiing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20954">Shaun White Snowboarding</game><game id="1509">Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding</game><game id="7859">Snowboard Kids Plus</game><game id="18062">Snowboard Kids</game><game id="16647">Amped 3</game><game id="18426">Snowboard Kids 2</game><game id="18782">SSX Tricky</game><game id="12418">SSX on Tour</game><game id="17149">SSX 3</game><game id="565">Twisted Edge: Extreme Snowboarding</game><game id="16640">Rippin' Riders</game><game id="17969">SSX Blur</game><game id="25097">Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder</game><game id="24449">We Ski &amp; Snowboard</game><game id="21727">MTV Sports: Snowboarding</game><game id="28475">Stoked: Big Air Edition</game><game id="20880">We Ski</game><game id="35516">Winter Stars</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png</image></root>
