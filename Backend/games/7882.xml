At the bottom of the screen are 3 meters showing the power usage (in watts), score and time taken. As the player moves between rooms they need to pass over objects to turn them off. Traveling between floors is achieved by ducking and entering pipes. When the game starts the score increases at a steady rate which decreases as objects get switched off. When everything in the building is turned off the player needs to exit. The only way to lose the game is by traveling up to the roof of the building and skating off the edge.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="23">Skateboarding</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20661">Skate 2</game><game id="28135">Skate 3</game><game id="5338">Skate Boardin'</game><game id="30947">Tony Hawk: SHRED</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1226822-superskateboardin___article_image.jpg</image></root>
