<root><id>40522</id><name>Top Rider</name><description>OverviewTop Racer is a motorcycle racing game from a behind-the-bike perspective. In both these respects, it's a very similar game to Sega's Hang-On series of motorcycle racers. The player can choose from two modes: Grand Prix, in which the player partakes in several consecutive races and Touring, in which the player can choose one of four courses for a single race.The game is notable for its unusual peripheral: An inflatable motorcycle with a special handlebar controller built-in. The player can sit on the peripheral once fully inflated and use the handlebars to control the on-screen bike.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11570">Hang-On</game><game id="18692">Super Hang-On</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2367434-top_rider_fc.jpg</image></root>
