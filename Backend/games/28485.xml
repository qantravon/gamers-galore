Karuizawa YÅ«kai Annai (The Karuizawa Kidnapping Guide) was released for the PC-88 in early 1985 and for the FM-7 in July that same year. It utilized the command menu system and point-and-click cursor interface of both Portopia Serial Murder Case and Hokkaido Chain Murders, in addition to introducing its own innovation: an overhead map. This gave the player direct control over the player character, who can be moved around in a top-down view to explore the area.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="28876">Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!!</game><game id="33786">Tokyo Nampa Street</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/59247/1152756-karuizawa_yuukai_annai.png</image></root>
