The game will also unlock unique skills and abilities for your hero in both the Xbox 360 and PC versions of Fable III.GameplayFable Coin Golf follows the conventions of a putt-putt golf style game. However, instead of a ball, Fable Coin Golf uses a puck. The main objective is to shoot the puck into the target in as few shots as possible. Each "hole" has a certain score target to for bronze, silver, and gold medals. The hole is also fairly forgiving, if you get the puck close enough to the hole it will start to gravitate towards the target, which can come in handy on some shots.ScoringActionPointsEach turn taken-100 (Note: the turn in which you get the puck into the hole does not have a -100 point penalty)Hole-in-one+100Each coin collected+20Each enemy hit (without the red power-up)-50Each enemy you kill (while using the red power-up)+25Bouncing off a surface+2Cutting down a tree (while using the green power-up)+10Hitting an explosive barrel+8Bouncing off of a balloon or rubber band+4Collecting a power-up+10Building a bridge (while using the blue power-up)+50Using a gate switch+20Use a teleport+10Detonate a bomb+20Fire a motar+8</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6300">Hot Shots Golf Fore!</game><game id="20598">Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds</game><game id="21435">Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 2</game><game id="21364">Golf: Tee It Up!</game><game id="5160">3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2193498-box_fcg.png</image></root>
