<root><id>22664</id><name>Catrap</name><description>OverviewCatrap is a puzzle game released for the original Game Boy; it features two characters (a boy and a girl) that have been cursed with cat-like features, they must traverse puzzle rooms to find and defeat all the enemies. There are 100 levels that may be played in any order, so that a player can stop the game and return to whatever point they wish (though the player may also generate a password that can be used to recall what levels they’ve already completed). The rooms gradually increase in difficulty from completely straightforward A to B levels to incredibly complex patterns of boulders, ladders, and destructible walls.GameplayIn the initial levels, the player chooses between playing as the male cat or the female cat, whereas in later levels both characters are used simultaneously, as the player must switch back and forth between them to maneuver through the puzzle room. Each level features at least one enemy; the goal being to reach all enemies and destroy them. The enemies cannot harm the main characters, so the difficulty is in finding the correct route through the level without getting stuck. If the player believes they’ve made a mistake, they can rewind time as far back as they please and try again.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="3244">Toki Tori</game><game id="36713">Toki Tori 2</game><game id="10053">Loader Larry</game><game id="40940">Flappy Special</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3863/433979-catrap_box_art.jpg</image></root>
