Whilst Wonder Boy would begin his journey on foot, players could often navigate them on via a skateboard, should the correct item be collected.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1502">Adventure Island</game><game id="9982">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</game><game id="18779">Adventure Island III</game><game id="11213">Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise</game><game id="6143">Super Adventure Island</game><game id="9763">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</game><game id="9101">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</game><game id="4968">Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle</game><game id="7108">Alex Kidd: High-Tech World</game><game id="3479">Keith Courage in Alpha Zones</game><game id="2866">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</game><game id="8575">Pac-Land</game><game id="6386">Wardner</game><game id="32212">The Equalizer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2363107-sms_wonderboy_au.jpg</image></root>
