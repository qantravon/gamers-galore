<root><id>923</id><name>The X-Files: Resist or Serve</name><description>The X-Files: Resist or Serve is an action/survival horror game based on the hit television series that ran on the Fox network from 1993 to 2002. The game's events take place during the seventh season of the show, before David Duchovny had left the series. Players assume the roles of FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in an attempt to thwart malevolent forces that are threatening a town called Red Falls. Events play out during the course of the game much as they do on the show and allow the player to see events from each agent's unique perspective. The show's stars, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, lent their likenesses and voices to the developers and the game's story is penned by the show's writers thus making it a reasonably authentic experience. The game was released in 2004, a year after the show ceased, for Sony's Playstation 2. However a version for Microsoft's Xbox had also been announced but was never released.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20015">Bureau 13</game><game id="4312">Silent Hill</game><game id="9418">Resident Evil 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2139884-box_txfros.png</image></root>
