One of the biggest goals of the game is to make sure the animals in your zoo are happy. To do so the exhibit of that animal has to suitable for it. For instance Giraffes love savannah grass and a lot of trees. Other animals like different types of terrain and foliage. Every exhibit also needs a shelter for the animals.

There are 3 types of staff you can hire.A basic zoo in Zoo Tycoon.Zookeepers - Zookeepers will feed and heal sick animals. They also make the animals happier when they enter their exhibits. If an animal escapes from its exhibit the zookeeper will catch it. Zookeepers can also be assigned to specific exhibits. Maintenance workers - Maintenance workers pick up trash, empty trash cans and fix broken fences so animals won't escape. Tour Guides - Tour Guides help guests around the zoo and also tell them information about various animals. They also increase the guests happiness level.
