<root><id>14280</id><name>Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio</name><description>This is an early predecessor of the turn-based strategy genre eventually popularised by Civilisation. Set in Renaissance Italy, each player takes turns in making decisions about grain stocks, land purchases, and more importantly how to build up their settlement - the balance between food stocks, population, law and order and cashflow is here in a very early form. Also here is a crude graphical depiction of your growing town, which includes many of the developments that Civilisation relied upon 12 years later - the marketplace for commerce, cathedral and palace for status, and defences against attack.The game was itself heavily influenced on the earliest known turn-based strategy game, Hamurabi. The most common cultural reference from that game is repeated here, and happens at the start of each turn where "xx% of your grain store was eaten by rats".</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/126726/1753976-untitled.jpg</image></root>
