The player can create a custom lightsaber by selecting a hilt and one of five blade colors. The player can choose to wield a single saber, one saber in each hand, or a "saber staff" similar to Darth Maul's double ended lightsaber in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The different sabers each have unique styles and special moves. When using a single saber, the player can choose between three stances which affect the speed and power of attacks; if using dual sabers, the player can switch off the second saber and use the "Fast"-style single-saber stance.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/5241-1.jpg</image></root>
