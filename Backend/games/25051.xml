<root><id>25051</id><name>Warriors Orochi Z</name><description>OverviewÂ Orochi Z combines Musou Orochi and Musou Orochi: Maou Sairin, with over  90 playable characters and 140 stories. Familiar elements like the  ability to easily fuse weapons, team attacks, and 3-character teams (now  with player 2 able to choose their own separate team) return in this  entry. Gyuuki and Dodomeki, both incomplete and usable as Versus-arena  only in Maou Sairin, are now fully playable, as well as other new  characters like Benkei and Sanzang Faishi. Characters have new alternate  costumes (such as their Dynasty Warriors 6 models for the Chinese  characters), and there have been expansions in Dream Modes allowing  variant story exploration, such as Da Ji freeing Orochi from the Mystics  or Orochi winning the Battle of Koshi Castle. Graphics and AI aggressiveness were reworked to take advantage of the PS3, including more soldiers on the battlefield.  Koei had plans to localize the game in Europe and America, but Sony canceled these due to "concerns about ratings".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27210">Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes</game><game id="23748">Dynasty Warriors Online: Dance of the Divine General</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/47377/1103573-orochi_z.jpg</image></root>
