One strike to the right area causes an instant kill. The player may also injure their opponents hands making them unable to hold two swords. There are 2 attack buttons used for performing horizontal and vertical attacks. Player wielding each weapon has 3 selectable stances with specific sets of moves. The player can surrender any time during battle by pressing select, what will result in a cutscene with the enemy decapitating (although it is not fully shown as the body unfortunately remains intact) or shooting the kneeling warrior in the back of his head.Selectable weaponsKatanaYariLongswordBroadswordNaginataNodachiRevolverM16</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8195">Way of the Samurai</game><game id="20678">Soulcalibur IV</game><game id="6153">Soul Blade</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="721">Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="22940">Kengo: Master of Bushido</game><game id="1073">Way of the Samurai 2</game><game id="26431">Kengo: Legend of the 9</game><game id="27591">RAZE</game><game id="29790">Deadliest Warrior: The Game</game><game id="35844">Deadliest Warrior: Legends</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/34651/2236183-bushidoblade.jpg</image></root>
