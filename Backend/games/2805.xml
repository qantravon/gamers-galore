In an attempt to save the project a director's cut was published in the UK in 1999 which, in a successful attempt to gain a BBFC 18 rating (roughly equivalent  to the ESRB M rating) featured a news ticker displaying crude and sexist jokes at the bottom of the screen during gameplay and an extra world featuring fetishistic and sexual imagery (such as real photographs of bondage, rotating statues of women in sexual positions and a naked woman pacing in a cage occasionally taking profane phone calls). This however backfired since many shops would not stock the game due to it's title and exploitative nature, resulting in commercial failure.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/124465/1706190-1.jpg</image></root>
