Though superficially resembling Excitebike with the various jumps and wheelies the player can pull off, it plays more like a traditional top-down racer such as Super Sprint or RC Pro-Am.Konami would later revisit Motocross with Motocross Champion's spiritual successor Motocross Maniacs for the Game Boy, which approached the format with a far more abstract assortment of loop-the-loops and nitro-assisted jumping.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19879">Motocross Maniacs</game><game id="15025">Excitebike</game><game id="1374">R.C.
