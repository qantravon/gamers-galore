Natural Ultimate Digital Experiment</name><description>Overview You play as a tester for the humanoid looking female robot known as the Personal Assist Secretary System (a.k.a P.A.S.S.). Because the robot has limited functionality the game is similar to the Dreamcast game Seaman or the Nintendo 64 game Hey You, Pikachu!. The gameplay revolves around the player pointing to objects in the environment and saying the name of the object through the players' headset. The robot then remembers the name and function of the object and the player then continues this process to teach P.A.S.S. how to function.Fun Facts Despite the intentionally misleading title, there is no nudity in this game. Because this game was only released in Japan the P.A.S.S. can only understand Japanese.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1442">Seaman</game><game id="12154">Creatures</game><game id="17113">Hey You, Pikachu!</game><game id="10148">Nintendogs</game><game id="26826">Milo and Kate</game><game id="19969">Lifeline</game><game id="27598">Eyedentify</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/1271317-nude_box.jpg</image></root>
