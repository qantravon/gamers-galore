It takes elements from both Mirror's Edge and Rez, with running and platforming inspired by the former and visuals inspired by the latter.Fotonica was released on July 18th, 2011 for PC and Mac through the official Fotonica website. While the full game is free to download, a pay-what-you-want model is in place to support the developers.GameplayThe game consists of various stages in which the player runs in a straight line, jumping to and from platforms to reach the end, where a total score is tallied based on the player's performance. In another nod to Rez, Fotonica features five environmentally different stages with an unlockable final level. Each stage has a series of pink dots the player can collect for bonus points and fluid performance will turn the world gold, further increasing the player's score.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21213">Mirror's Edge</game><game id="32959">Proun</game><game id="28976">Canabalt</game><game id="17578">Rez</game><game id="36236">T.E.C 3001</game><game id="8117">SkyRoads</game><game id="35317">inMomentum</game><game id="35713">Dyad</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8124/1844351-untitled_1.png</image></root>
