The pinball playfield is reflected up into the player's view via a partially silvered mirror that allows score information and other game effects to flash "in front" of the playfield.Due to the use of mirrors, nudging the Varkon cabinet in the same way a player would nudge a pinball machine resulted in the ball moving in the opposite direction.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1789130-varkon.jpg</image></root>
