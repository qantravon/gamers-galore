GameplayThe game revolves around two main characters, both requiring unique styles of gameplay. The primary character, Sphinx, is a demi-god with a mostly human appearance. He carries a sword, and is involved in mostly action-oriented gameplay. The other character, "The mummy", was previously a prince known as Tutankhamen, before put under a curse that had him mummified. The downside of this is that he moves slowly, and is unable to attack, but since he is undead he can solve various puzzles by using his indestructible body to his advantage. Examples: setting fire to himself, crushing himself, and cutting himself into three separate mummies. While this may seem a little masochistic, it's all handled in a very light manner, and the mummy is really an amusing character, in contrast to the serious Sphinx. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19026">Star Fox Adventures</game><game id="12572">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="15835">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</game><game id="19467">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</game><game id="11470">Scaler</game><game id="20351">Kya: Dark Lineage</game><game id="20529">Insecticide</game><game id="18926">Malice</game><game id="13169">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</game><game id="159">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue</game><game id="19188">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan</game><game id="28006">Okamiden</game><game id="11324">Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum</game><game id="31776">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1798001-box_sphinx.png</image></root>
