It focuses on exploration in lieu of  action and sprawls over a large, stylistically drawn world. It has since inspired the development of other games, notably     Knytt and  Within a Deep Forest.  The basic premise of Seiklus is simple, yet endearing. You're sitting on a rock with your girlfriend, watching shooting stars. A meteor hits and knocks you into the "World". Your objective is to collect a large quantity of 5 different colored flames, and become reunited.  Seklus features a variety of different environments. Exploring a deep cave, monsters ready to suck you up and carry you off, venturing into an active volcano, exploring a lush woodland landscape, climbing to the top of incredibly high trees or sliding down a huge mountainside. The music in Seiklus is almost entirely Keygen music, which gives it a unique sound. Besides this, there's the basic ambient sounds that blend into the background.   "Seiklus" is the Estonian word for "Adventure" which fits the game perfectly</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19985">Knytt Stories</game><game id="19031">Knytt</game><game id="16751">Within a Deep Forest</game><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="23727">Iji</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/18403/1077538-seiklus.gif</image></root>
