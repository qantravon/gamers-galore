<root><id>36473</id><name>Demolition Inc.</name><description>OverviewEarth has been purchased by the "Society for the protection of endangered planets" (S.P.E.P), who intends on revegetating it and turn it into an intergalactic recreation area. For the task they have hired Mike, an alien one man demolition crew, to rid the planet from civilization. To his disposal, Mike has a wide arsenal of items to destroy entire city blocks. With each block cleaned from buildings, grass and trees takes its place until the entire section is revegetated and Mike is payed for his work. Though he must hurry, for the Army gets called in the second the first accident happens and he has a limited amount of time to complete his task before they arrive and blow him out of the sky.The game is physics based, making every demolition different depending on how the player decides to tackle the challenge. Some are obvious chain reaction puzzles, while others come down to simply taking over a tanker and jumping a ramp into a skyscraper. As things are destroyed, a combo meter fills and the player's position on the leaderboard goes up, the more money he has in his pocket and how much time spent when the task is done.ItemsOil CloudFree (Acquired by collecting tokens)A cloud that creates an oil slick and makes it impossible for cars to steer.
