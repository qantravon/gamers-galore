<root><id>14863</id><name>Shamus</name><description>The game was originally released on the Atari 400/800, but the game was since ported to the Commodore 64, IBM PCs, and even the Game Boy Color.The original version of Shamus contained 128 levels, in which the player (a robot detective named Shamus) navigated a maze with electric walls, avoiding and shooting enemies, collecting items, and eventually reaching “The Shadow’s Lair.”Again, similar to the gameplay in Berzerk, the player is penalized for standing too long in one spot. If the player decides to linger in a room too long, the “Shadow” appears and attacks the player, usually killing him.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="4010">Berzerk</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/704538-1139441694_06.png</image></root>
