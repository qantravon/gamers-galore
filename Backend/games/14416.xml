Ninja Gaiden II retains many of the original's concepts and expands upon them. In the first Ninja Gaiden, players jumped and clung to walls, slashed enemies with a sword, and collected an array of secondary weapons. In this sequel, players can also scale the walls-up and down, recruit up to two Shadow Clones which mimic his moves and are impervious to damage, and use several new secondary weapons. Once again, we catch up with the ninja Ryu Hayabusa, this time on his quest to save his girlfriend Irene Lew from the hands of a dark wizard named Ashtar. A licensed port by GameTek was released later for DOS-based PC's and Commodore Amiga. It was also released on Wii's Virtual Console in North America in 2007.GameplayNinja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos retains the most of the core gameplay from the original while making few changes and additions to it as well.Ryu retains his various projectile attacks which consume ninja power. In this sequel, any attacks that Ryu performs are mimicked by his Shadow Clones, including the projectile attacks:Throwing Star (5 points) - the most basic shuriken attackWindmill Throwing Star (10 points) - acting as a boomerang, this star flies back and forth across the screen, taking out enemies until returned to RyuThe Art of the Fire Wheel (8 points) - tosses a wheel of fire diagonally upwards.Fire Dragon Balls (8 points) - fires dragon balls diagonally downwards.Invincible Fire Wheel (15 points) - a circling version of the Fire Wheel which renders Ryu invincible. Unlike in the previous game, the wheel can be called at will.In Ninja Gaiden II, Ryu has the power to climb any wall by pressing Up or Down on the control pad. In the previous game, the player could only "stick" to a wall by jumping towards it, but was unable to scale in any direction without jumping to an opposite wall or by using a climbing technique that involved jumping away from the wall and immediately grasping it again.Ryu and one shadow cloneThe most innovative new feature is the ability to create "Shadow Clones," also referred to as "Phantom Doubles" or "Split Clones," which are orange shadow versions of Ryu. The Shadow Clones constantly follow him and attack at the same time as Ryu. These clones are immune to damage; enemies and projectiles pass through them. If the player stops moving, the clones freeze in place, whether on the ground or in mid-air. The player can have one or two Shadow Clones following after picking up the power up that summons them. In the adjacent screenshot, the player has jumped to the left of the enemy, while his spirit clone remains in mid-air in Ryu's previous position. Frozen in place, the clone copies the attacks of the player.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3482">Shinobi</game><game id="8666">Shinobi II: The Silent Fury</game><game id="16074">Shinobi III : Return of the Ninja Master</game><game id="236">The Revenge of Shinobi</game><game id="19193">Demon Sword</game><game id="10701">The Legend of Kage</game><game id="1257">Blaster Master</game><game id="10323">Metroid Fusion</game><game id="14216">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</game><game id="8292">Super Metroid</game><game id="11321">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</game><game id="1618">The Ninja Warriors</game><game id="15970">Adventures of Tom Sawyer</game><game id="12036">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</game><game id="6673">Castlevania</game><game id="14357">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</game><game id="13197">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</game><game id="16851">Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles</game><game id="11443">Super Castlevania IV</game><game id="20627">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</game><game id="15790">Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="17356">Metroid: Zero Mission</game><game id="19944">Disney's Aladdin</game><game id="20461">God of War III</game><game id="21228">Battletoads</game><game id="14224">Battletoads in Ragnarok's World</game><game id="19366">Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team</game><game id="9763">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</game><game id="1768">Shadow of the Ninja</game><game id="21465">Retro Game Challenge</game><game id="17939">Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra</game><game id="12673">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</game><game id="20435">Mega Man ZX Advent</game><game id="7274">ActRaiser</game><game id="13904">Ninja Five-O</game><game id="2866">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</game><game id="290">Vampire Killer</game><game id="1371">First Samurai</game><game id="1850">Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362088-nes_ninjagaiden2.jpg</image></root>
