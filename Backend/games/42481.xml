All action is modeled after historical events, and the goal of the missions is not to obliterate the enemy, but to seize and hold strategical locations. Following the same spirit, there is no resource gathering, the player must use reasonable tactics to overwhelm the enemy, as the AI tries to respond the player maneuvers. There are no scripted events.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17369-1.jpg</image></root>
