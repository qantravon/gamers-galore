The dishes can be used as healing items, and when used in this way the characters gain experience, represented in the game as calories, and level up raising their stats. Besides the "healing" dishes, there is also a skill tree that is expanded also as the player collects ingredients to make dishes on the skill tree's nodes. The skills gained are generally combo boosts, or new combos.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="40841">Toriko: Gourmet Survival 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2279058-gourmet_survival.jpg</image></root>
