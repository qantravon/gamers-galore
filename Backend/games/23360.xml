As the player moves the probe around with the trackball a trail is left behind that they must cross again after surrounding an object in order to score points. Double points are rewarded for circling multiple particles at once. Play ends after losing three lives by crashing the probe into the particles, getting a high score allows players to sign their name with the trackball instead of putting in their initials.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4527/1200640-quantumflyerfront.jpg</image></root>
