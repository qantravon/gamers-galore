The series continues on the iPhone.StoryCrash Bandicoot, Crunch Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, and Aku Aku are once again chilling at home. Crash sleeps lazily as Crunch and Aku Aku discuss the latest diets, and Coco works on Crash's ride. A bright light suddenly shines down on their home. Seconds later it is raised into the sky and disappears. Their mortal enemies Dr. Neo Cortex, Dr. N. Gin, Tiny, and Dingodile are working in their own lair, planning on how to take Crash out, when the same beam of light shines into their castle. Both groups of characters are transported to a galaxy far away ruled by the evil Emperor Velo XXVII. He demands they race for their freedom and if they don't comply he will destroy planet earth. Completing the game with different teams characters gets you access to different endings.Multiple Endings: Team CrashTeam Crash walks into Emperor Velo's Colosseum as he's fuming over his loss. Fuming too hard as a matter of fact when he suddenly explodes. Its a Wizard of Oz moment as its revealed that he is only a few feet tall alien that was wearing a huge, frightening robotic suit that wasn't strong enough to withstand its controller's anger. As the little alien crawls out of the wreckage, Crash and friends walk over and pick up the scepter that Velo carried. Crash dreams of turning Velo's planet, that happens to be shaped like Velo's face, into a stunning image of his own mug. When Crash snaps back he instead hands the scepter back to Velo and Crash's friends ask to be taken home. We then find Crash and team relaxing on the beach, soaking up the sun.Team CortexTeam Cortex walks into Emperor Velo's Colosseum as he's fuming over his loss. Fuming too hard as a matter of fact when he suddenly explodes. Its a Wizard of Oz moment as its revealed that he is only a few feet tall alien that was wearing a huge, frightening, robotic suit that wasn't strong enough to withstand its controller's anger. As the little alien crawls out of the wreckage, Cortex walks up to the wreckage and pulls out the scepter that was used by Velo. He laughs menacling feeling the power in his hands. The real Velo suddenly jumps out of the robotic wreckage straight at Cortex, knocking him over, and trying to yank the scepter from his hands. Tiny plucks the wimpy emperor off of Cortex then tries to reach for the scepter. Cortex denies him as he strains to lift the scepter above his head and says "On to earth". The end suddenly falls aff the scepter and they are warped to strange aztec looking ruins in the middle of a jungle. Dr. N. Gin, being happy to be back on earth, starts kissing the ground. Cortex looks into the sky and seeing multiple moons notices something... their not on earth. Natives appear walking menacing out from the woods. As this happens Tiny picks up the scepter, puts the end back on, and raises it up. The natives stop and bow down to Tiny, their new ruler. We're left with Cortex yelling "TINY!!! You buffoon!"Playable CharactersCrash BandicootCoco BandicootCrunch BandicootDr. Neo CortexN. GinTiny TigerN. TropyPuraDingodilePolarN.
