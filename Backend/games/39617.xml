This flashlight is the only means of fighting the supernatural horrors that inhabit the eponymous domicile, so the player must continually keep it stocked with fresh batteries, which act as the player character's health.Originally produced for MSX home computers in 1986 by watch/electronics manufacturer Casio, Irem decided to publish an improved Famicom Disk System version in late 1987. Though the game was never released outside of Japan and never officially localized, the only Japanese language in the game is on the title screen. Therefore it is entirely possible to play the game without knowing Japanese.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20982">Alan Wake</game><game id="2867">Siren</game><game id="15963">Forbidden Siren 2</game><game id="39300">Youkai Club</game><game id="4502">Haunted House</game><game id="10395">The Goonies II</game><game id="6673">Castlevania</game><game id="20383">Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="39865">Shadow Land</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2307027-youkai_yashiki_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
