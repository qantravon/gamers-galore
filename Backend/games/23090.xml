However, his experiment went terribly wrong, as two Meganoids (Zauser and Koros) destroyed Dr. Haran's Martian laboratory. Seeking to expand the Meganoid project, the two declared war on Earth. At the same time, the Muge Empire would stage an invasion, resulting in mass chaos. Luckily, the White Base (with cooperation from the Photon Power Plant, Saotome Research Institute, and Dancougar) would push back the invaders, causing them to scatter across space.One year later, just as Dr. Haran predicted, conflict between Earth Federation and the space-based Principality of Zeon broke out, resulting in the One Year War. The members of the White Base team would be renamed Londo Bell, and would be given the task of defending the Earth.Elsewhere, the aliens from Planet Barm have lost their homeland, and now plot to make the Earth their own...Featured SeriesA list of the anime series which are featured in the game.
