<root><id>42310</id><name>Magical Drop V</name><description>Magical Drop is played in a style and gameplay similar to Compile's (now Sega's) Puyo Puyo and Taito's Puzzle Bobble franchises; a "stack" of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's "clown" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. "Chains" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession.</description><genres><genre>Puzzle</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14767-1.jpg</image></root>
