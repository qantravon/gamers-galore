As you progress, you'll not only experience a traditionally fantasy/medieval world, but also pass through the Stone Age, Classical Age, Modern Age, and beyond. Players will have a chance to get involved in just about every aspect of building a prosperous empire, such as construction, increasing capacity, keeping people happy, researching, economic managements, and diplomatic encounters. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/129802/1784969-cultural.jpg</image></root>
