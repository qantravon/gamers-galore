It plays something like Famicom/Advance Wars or Daisenryaku, where the goal is to quickly conquer locations by producing a lot of units each turn and sending them against enemy forces. As with those games, there is also a little close-up graphic of the two units whenever they meet for battle, which shows how the two sides are faring in the conflict.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33739">Dai Senryaku</game><game id="2177">Famicom Wars</game><game id="2464">Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen</game><game id="28991">Hanjuku Eiyuu</game><game id="40726">Fairytale</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360818-king_of_kings_fc.jpg</image></root>
