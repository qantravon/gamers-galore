The game features eight levels of space flight action shooting. For instance navigate your vessel through a minefield within a timelimit. Or destroy the communication arrays of the Raxxons on the planet itself. Although gameplay is limited, the vector graphics are impressive and so are the cutscenes. You can look at your spacecraft from 6 diffent perspectives. The game is best played using the mouse. The action is viewed from the cockpit.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16951">Inferno: The Odyssey Continues</game><game id="7103">F29 Retaliator</game><game id="19727">Star Wars: TIE Fighter</game><game id="10309">Descent: Freespace - The Great War</game><game id="16002">Wing Commander</game><game id="23134">Battlestar Galactica</game><game id="35947">SOL: Exodus</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/873007-epic___front.jpg</image></root>
