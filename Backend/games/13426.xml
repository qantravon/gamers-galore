In order to receive the entirety of this inheritance though, the player must prove himself a worthy member of the Benedict family. After being given $500,000 in seed money from the relative's lawyer, the player must trade stocks effectively enough in order to make certain large item purchases like a house or yacht, keep his girlfriend extremely well-pampered, and keep himself in peak physical condition as this is the Benedict way of life.If the player fails to complete any of the game's objectives, he loses all access to the inheritance, is effectively disowned from the Benedict family, and the game is over.ObjectivesPurchase a one million dollar mansionPurchase a yacht for your honeymoonGet marriedWin an auction for and purchase a European castle formally belonging to the Benedict family</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6436">Stocks And Bonds</game><game id="8557">Big Business</game><game id="17392">Lemonade Stand</game><game id="34832">Vegas Games 2000</game><game id="39909">Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku</game><game id="40165">The Money Game</game><game id="40640">Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku 2</game><game id="40781">Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362594-nes_wallstreetkid.jpg</image></root>
