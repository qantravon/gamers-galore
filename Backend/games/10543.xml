<root><id>10543</id><name>Virtua Cop</name><description>Virtua Cop Virtua Cop (known as Virtua Squad for the North American PC version) is a       Light gun shooter created by      Sega, and headed by      Yu Suzuki.  Its original incarnation was an Arcade Game in 1994 and it was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995, and then the  PC in 1997.  It was later bundled with      Virtua Cop 2 in Japan and Europe on the  Playstation 2 as      Virtua Cop: Elite Edition (Virtua Cop Rebirth in Japan) on August 25, 2002 and November 29, 2002 respectively.  It included gallery extras and implementation of      Namco 's Guncon-2 lightgun support and it is the best port of the games.  In 2004, a port was developed for the     Nokia N-Gage   Handheld System.  This was cancelled by the quality control team before its release. GameplayPlayers assume the role of  one of two police officers, namely Michael Hardy and James Cools and use the light gun to shoot enemies and if a civilian was shot it the player would be penalized.  The Name derived from the  polygongraphical style which was used in      Virtua Fighter as well.  This Graphical style was unique because most games of this time period used two dimensional graphics such as      Lethal Enforcers.  This was one of the first games to have enviromental damage and it may have been the first 3-D shooter to have an expolding barrel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17486">Mad Dog McCree</game><game id="15365">Time Crisis 2</game><game id="6490">Hogan's Alley</game><game id="20519">Ghost Squad</game><game id="19246">Vampire Night</game><game id="6077">Crisis Zone</game><game id="21276">CarnEvil</game><game id="15008">Confidential Mission</game><game id="14088">Operation Thunderbolt</game><game id="20460">Target: Terror</game><game id="14869">Operation Wolf</game><game id="16218">Battle Clash</game><game id="508">The House of the Dead</game><game id="422">The House of the Dead 2</game><game id="7703">The House of the Dead III</game><game id="15867">Time Crisis</game><game id="9898">Time Crisis 3</game><game id="21468">Time Crisis 4</game><game id="2817">Corpse Killer</game><game id="3413">Ed Hunter</game><game id="3484">Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge</game><game id="14613">Die Hard 2: Die Harder</game><game id="27102">Terminator Salvation</game><game id="3641">007: From Russia with Love</game><game id="33667">Mechanical Violator Hakaider: Last Judgement</game><game id="33679">Mighty Hits Special</game><game id="33678">Mighty Hits</game><game id="19345">Die Hard Trilogy</game><game id="35794">Gunslingers</game><game id="30164">2 Spicy</game><game id="3166">GoldenEye 007</game><game id="44305">Blue Estate</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14444/421020-virtua_cop_cover.jpg</image></root>
