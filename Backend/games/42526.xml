Navigate Mike's UFO over cities of earth and unfold complete chaos with your tools and weapons: Cars which drive into tower blocks and let them collapse, high-rises which fall onto other high-rises, and exploding cows which let whole streets of houses come tumbling down! 
Demolition, Inc. is 100% physics technology: nothing is predetermined, and nothing is pre-animated. Only you make a determination what you do and what you see! Every time you play will have a unique experience.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17703-1.png</image></root>
