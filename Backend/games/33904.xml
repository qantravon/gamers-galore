Lucky Marciano - a parody of the late boxing champion Rocky Marciano) are fought against.  After winning against all his challengers, the game starts once again on a tougher difficulty setting.  GameplayUsing the two joysticks on the cabinet, the player controls the protagonist's punches, blocks, and dodges.  The left joystick controls his left arm and the right joystick controls his right arm.  If the player gets KO'ed, he/she must quickly swirl the joysticks before the count of 10 to get up and recover.Technical InformationSega System Multi 32 hardware  Main CPU : V70 (@ 20 Mhz), Z80 (@ 8.053975 Mhz) Sound Chips : YM3438 (@ 8.053975 Mhz), MultiPCM (@ 8.053975 Mhz)  Screen orientation : Horizontal Video resolution : 832 x 224 pixels Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz Palette colors : 32768  Players : 2 Control : Double 8-way joysticks</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="20">Boxing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/25067/1686880-titlefight_cabinet.jpg</image></root>
