It was one of Game Arts' first forays into RPGs, though they would later become renowned in the field for series such as Lunar and Grandia. As well as being an early start for Game Arts, the project also had on board a young Akihiko Yoshida, who go on to become a graphic designer for many major Squaresoft games.While by all appearances an RPG in the common 8-bit Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy mold, Faria takes a few cues from Ys: The Vanished Omen with its combat and the Legend of Zelda with its puzzle-based dungeons.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14318">Ys: The Vanished Omens</game><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game><game id="16305">Dragon Warrior</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361718-nes_faria.jpg</image></root>
