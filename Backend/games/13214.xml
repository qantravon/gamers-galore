<root><id>13214</id><name>Monster Hunter</name><description>Basic PremiseMonster Hunter challenges you to complete different quests while confronting a variety of creatures. As monster hunters, you'll battle against powerful beasts either alone or with the aid of others. The game's objectives vary from defeating beasts and protecting a town to collecting items. For every completed objective, you'll gain more weapons and equipment, which can also be upgraded in shops.  The name of the game is to be taken very literally.  It is important to make the distinction that the game is a "monster hunting simulation," rather than the more traditional character action you may expect from the genre.  These monsters are large, self-interested, tough, and will kill you repeatedly if you don't have a very good idea of how to combat them.  </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14522">Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen</game><game id="17843">Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst</game><game id="11701">Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II Plus</game><game id="3040">Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II</game><game id="7048">Kingdom of Paradise</game><game id="20499">Too Human</game><game id="9639">Dragon Seeds</game><game id="25935">Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</game><game id="24421">Clash of the Titans</game><game id="32630">Lord of Arcana</game><game id="32697">Dark Souls</game><game id="14159">Grandia Xtreme</game><game id="36417">Hunter Blade</game><game id="38049">Dinosaur Hunting</game><game id="40619">BRAZEN</game><game id="41446">Artizens</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2092599-box_mhunter.png</image></root>
