Each character has their own linear level to go through where you must collect floating versions of a specific number. If you collect too many of the wrong number then players have to start the level over. Once players get through a level, they are taken to a bonus stage where you must do simple addition or subtraction by throwing balls into the mouth of a massive clown muppet head.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6679">Elmo's Letter Adventure</game><game id="4107">Elmo's Deep Sea Adventure</game><game id="11877">The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland</game><game id="3151">Cookie Monster Munch</game><game id="24259">Sesame Street: Bert &amp; Ernie's Imagination Adventure</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15228/595840-elmosnumberjourney.jpg</image></root>
