Tapping close to the Prince makes him walk and tapping far away makes him run. Attacking is done simply by tapping enemies, which makes the Prince use his sword. The Prince will jump if the player taps the stylus across a gap and if a wall is tapped, he can climb and jump from wall to wall. He can even attack enemies while jumping.By pressing and holding any button (except start), the player can take control of the Magus instead of the Prince and can then use his magic to manipulate certain objects.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1653">Ninja Gaiden</game><game id="1850">Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom</game><game id="25551">Totems</game><game id="27884">Assassin's Creed II: Discovery</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1797992-box_poptfk.png</image></root>
