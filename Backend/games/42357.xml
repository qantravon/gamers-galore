The player can rotate the blocks in 3D in order to fit them into the pit they are being guided into. Advanced users can play this game with odd three-dimensional pieces, or change the size of the pit, for depth of between 6 and 18 piles, and width and length of between 3 and 7.</description><genres><genre>Puzzle</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/16410-1.jpg</image></root>
