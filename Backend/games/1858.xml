<root><id>1858</id><name>Conan: Hall of Volta</name><description>An early platformer, Conan: Hall of Volta casts you in the role of the titular barbarian, as he takes on the evil wizard Volta. As Conan, the player will have to navigate through seven different stages, each filled with numerous deadly pits, perilous traps, and dangerous enemies. Conan is armed with a stock of throwable swords, which travel a certain distance before boomeranging back. If the Conan catches the sword, he can reuse it. If the sword strikes anything, like a wall or enemy, the sword is used up. Though Conan will be able to collect more swords during his adventure, they are few and far between and must be used wisely. The game originally started without the Conan tie-in called "Visigoth".</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/487/680964-characters.gif</image></root>
