Players (1 or 2 supported) had to perform various tasks across a variety of levels (laundry rooms) to process laundry.  Examples of taks included transferring laundry to and from washing machines, pressing washed laundry and hanging the laundry. Players have to meet a certain 'quota' each level, within a time limit. If they cannot manage this, the boss drops them through a trap door!  Like many games of the era and platform, it was extremely challenging.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1364/1665930-0.jpg</image></root>
