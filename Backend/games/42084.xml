Airline Tycoon 2 will challenge players to run a modern airline, design unique airplanes and grow a run-down carrier into a globally recognized company that passengers practically beg to fly.

Crafty opponents are also working to dominate the skies... and they won’t let anything stand in the way of their goals!</description><genres><genre>Construction and Management Simulation</genre><genre>Sandbox</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9466-1.jpg</image></root>
