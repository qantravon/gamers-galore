As the erstwhile protagonist of the previous games, Takeru Shirogane, the player begins the game in the exact same way as Muv-Luv Unlimited started: Waking up in an alternate timeline where the human race is locked in a desperate battle against alien invaders. However, the Shirogane still retains his memories of the events that occurred in Muv-Luv Unlimited and sets himself to the task of changing what he knows will be humanity's doomed future.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2263502-b005apxtus.09._sclzzzzzzz_.jpg</image></root>
