It began to release giant clouds of alien spores into the upper atmosphere that stayed there like clouds. The spores eventually multiplied until they covered the entire Earth throwing and blocked out the sun, casting the animals of Earth into darkness. This would eventually be called the "Twilight" by those who would survive.The spores, after multiplying many times, began falling to Earth. They began to smother everything and everyone on Earth. Most life was wiped out during this period which came to be know as "Nightfall". The governments did nothing, hoping to not provoke the alien like substance. Unfortunately this was their downfall as the end came all to quickly. Numerous humans however did survive, living out the months underground until the spores seemed to dissolve and decompose. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="196">X-COM: UFO Defense</game><game id="9448">Original War</game><game id="31771">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</game><game id="37183">UFO 2: Extraterrestrials - Shadows over Earth</game><game id="38418">UFO Online: Fight For Earth</game><game id="37152">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</game><game id="16537">COPS 2170: The Power of Law</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/60173/1470965-2zel6ys.jpg</image></root>
