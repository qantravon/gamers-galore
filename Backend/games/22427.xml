<root><id>22427</id><name>2 Days to Vegas</name><description>Plot2 Days to Vegas tells the crime-drama story of Vinny Shaw, an American of Irish descent recently released from Rickers Prison after 3 years of imprisonment (it is unclear as to what he was convicted of). Unfortunately for our protagonist, however, just an hour after he is released, his girlfriend, Nikki, is taken hostage and his brother, Tony, is taken by the mafia.Gameplay2 Days to Vegas presents itself as a 3rd person "cinematic action" game, taking place in a sandbox (though it is likely very instanced, as it takes place over several cities), similar to the Grand Theft Auto and Saint's Row series. The game is said to include other aspects, such as stealth missions, and the overall idea that the game as a whole is intended to be the equivalent of an American action film. The game includes the standard weapon set, "from all sorts of pistols to RPGs." Melee combat in the game will be done using Quick-Time Events, though more is to be revealed about the technology and design behind this.  One notable feature of the game is the fact that the entire game is set over a 48 hour time period. It has been confirmed that there is no multiplayer.   System Requirements  Recommended SystemQuad-Core Processor4 GB of RAMNvidia GeForce GTX 280 or similarUnknown Hard-Drive SpaceMinimum System Dual-Core Processor2 GB of RAMNvidia GeForce 8600 GTS or similar</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5618">Saints Row</game><game id="23346">The Godfather II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg</image></root>
