The player needs to collect 8 pieces of paper ("pages") whilst evading the Slender Man.Unlike Slender, Sanatorium is only available for PC. Sanatorium also features more maps to play on such as "Hospice".</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39028">Slender: The Eight Pages</game><game id="39825">Slender: The Arrival</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2295777-sanatorium.png</image></root>
