<root><id>17680</id><name>Pharaoh</name><description>OverviewPharaoh Is a city-building game set in Ancient Egypt. It is all about constructing and managing settlements and cities in Ancient Egypt. This was the fourth city building game developed by Impressions Games, since they had released Caesar 1, 2 and 3 before this. Pharaoh displayed many similarities to the Caesar games, with similar buildings, game mechanics and UI.CampaignThe campaign in Pharaoh plays out in chronological order, divided up along the major periods of that era:Pre-Dynastic Period (tutorial missions)Archaic PeriodOld KingdomMiddle KingdomNew KingdomAs the campaign progresses, the player will rise in rank from Village Elder to Pharaoh. Every rise in the ranks comes with a wage increase. This money can be used to boost the city's finances or send gifts to the Pharaoh to increase the player's favour with him. A high favour rating is often one of the objectives to complete the mission.Other objectives are gaining the required Culture, Prosperity and Monument ratings, as well as having a high enough population.ReligionLike other Impressions city-building games, religion plays a major role in Pharaoh. As governor, the player needs to pay sufficient homage to the gods, in order to gain their favour and be granted bonuses. Failure to pay such homage will result in punishment from the gods, varying from failed harvests to epidemics. The gods in Pharaoh are Osiris, Ra, Ptah, Seth and Bast, each with different bonuses and different punishments.MonumentsFittingly for a game about ancient Egypt, Pharaoh puts a large emphasis on monument-building. These monuments vary from small tombs to the iconic Pyramids, including Sphinxes.ExpansionThe expansion to Pharaoh, Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile, was released on Jul. 11, 2000.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="995">1701 A.D.</game><game id="8760">1503 A.D.: The New World</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="20648">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="12588">Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="22080">SimCity Societies: Destinations</game><game id="21729">Cities XL</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="13076">Age of Mythology</game><game id="26943">Children of the Nile: Alexandria</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="2859">Cultures: Die Saga</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="22372">The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="10978">The Settlers III</game><game id="19477">Heritage of Kings: The Settlers</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="31533">The Legend of Mystery - High Cultures</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="4820">Dungeon Keeper 2</game><game id="32175">Dungeon Keeper 3</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="31820">Majesty 2: Pocket Kingdom</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="12922">The Settlers</game><game id="16829">The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici</game><game id="6946">The Settlers: Fourth Edition</game><game id="2815">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</game><game id="3449">The Settlers II Mission CD</game><game id="9828">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire â€“ The Eastern Realm</game><game id="22371">The Settlers IV: Mission CD</game><game id="15294">The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="2081">The Settlers II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2169995-pharaoh_coverart.png</image></root>
