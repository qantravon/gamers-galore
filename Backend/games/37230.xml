Players construct houses that attract bugs into a garden, and get new items to expand the village. Bugs stay energized with healthy foods, while decorations like flowers entertain colony members.GameplayPlayers set worker bugs to specific jobs resulting in the insects gathering resources that help upgrade the village. Failure to protect the bugs results in them being harmed from antagonists.Upgrades include new houses. The bigger the house, the bigger the population. Dozens of bugs re-populate into hundreds of bugs. Buying sweets like cookies and sugarcubes keep these bugs energy at top level. And to break up the micro-management, players can take advantage of playing various minigames.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31048">FarmVille</game><game id="36879">CastleVille</game><game id="34929">CityVille</game><game id="40255">E.T.: The Green Planet</game><game id="40897">Ice Age Village</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2243842-box_bv.png</image></root>
