The goal is to convince the rats to march towards the machines that will eliminate them (staffed by Bart and Homer Simpson, as well as Krusty Show characters Sideshow Mel and Corporal Punishment) by using objects found in the vicinity. Like the Lemmings from the series of the same name, the rats will simply follow a set of rules defined by their programming and the player can use this to anticipate their actions and plan accordingly in order to trap them.The game was based on Audiogenic's earlier Amiga game Rat-Trap, which was licensed out to Acclaim so they could turn it into a The Simpsons licensed game. Acclaim published the game on almost every platform imaginable at the time, sub-licensing the home computer versions to Virgin Games.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11021">Cloning Clyde</game><game id="1579">Brain Lord</game><game id="8565">Wayne's World</game><game id="1446">Lemmings</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/219090-krusty_s_fun_house.jpg</image></root>
