There are a total of 64 stages and each is progressively more difficult. Exacerbating the issue is the player character's intolerance for getting crushed, roaming enemies and a limit based on how much power the player has remaining, which drops each time the player character lifts a block. The player character can also collect items that occasionally appear in the world, but these usually confer point bonuses and nothing more. Should the player manage to successfully complete a stage, they will be given an extra life to help with the next one.Every eighth stage is a "reprieve room", where there are very few blocks and the exit is easy to reach. However, the player needs to figure out the special technique to make a symbol appear, as these are instrumental for completing the game once the 64th floor has been reached. These generally involve tricks like holding a direction down on the D-pad for a length of time.Babel no Tou would be eventually repurposed for the Arcades with a "Vs. Babel no Tou" version. It is also available on two Japan-only Namco compilations: Namco Gallery Vol. 3 for the Game Boy and Namco Anthology Vol. 1 for the PS1.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="928">Solomon's Key</game><game id="17545">Sokoban</game><game id="636">Lode Runner</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2429930-babel_no_tou_fc.jpg</image></root>
