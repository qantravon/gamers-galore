Like other Nazo Puyo games, Rulue no Roux removes Puyo Puyo's competitive gameplay, instead placing emphasis on the completion of several challenges. The game features an RPG-like quest akin to its immediate predecessor Arle no Roux, and includes a remake of that game in addition to a new quest that stars Arle's rival Rulue.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/2164980-581938_21877_front.jpg</image></root>
