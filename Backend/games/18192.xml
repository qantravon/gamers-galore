<root><id>18192</id><name>Ultima: Runes of Virtue</name><description>OverviewUltima: Runes of Virtue is a side story of the Ultima universe published by Fujisankei Communications International (FCI) for the Nintendo Game Boy. Gameplay resembles early Legend of Zelda titles, with more emphasis on action-adventure than traditional role-playing.The Black Knight has stolen the Runes of Virtue. The player controls one of the Avatar's companions, choosing from Iolo, Shamino, Dupre, or Mariah. The game is not particularly canonical to the main series, and the map of Britannia used in-game bears little resemblance to its appearance in other games.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/136461/2428363-rov1cover.jpg</image></root>
