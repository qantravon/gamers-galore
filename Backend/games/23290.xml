I will post more information on the server status later today, however until the connection issue is resolved the servers can not go back online, I was given a projection of no later than 5PM EST today, but will verify that later as the day goes on.Thank you much for your patience.The servers never returned to operation, however, leaving the Irth Worlds community without a game. Speculation is this is because of legal troubles faced by the developer over intellectual property rights of the game, and a low number of subscribers.</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22996">Wish</game><game id="5767">Ultima Online</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/555603-irth_logo_ii.png</image></root>
