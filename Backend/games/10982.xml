Released in the middle of 1984 Technician Ted was one of the better ones with a large map and difficult jumps.    The game revolved around a day at work for Technician Ted and could only be beaten by performing the correct duties in the correct places in the correct order. This required traversal of the map to certain rooms by a certain time and doing related actions throughout the map.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8954">Kokotoni Wilf</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1337667-techniciantedcassette.jpg</image></root>
