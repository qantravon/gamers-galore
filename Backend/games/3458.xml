The game was developed by Irem and published by Jaleco in the United States, while Irem took up publishing in Japan. On March 26, 2004, the game was ported to the Game Boy Advance, developed by Raylight Studios and published by DSI Games and Zoo Digital. R-Type III was also emulated to the Wii Virtual Console on January 15, 2007.GameplayR-Type III made a number of refines and changes to the R-Type series, one of them being the first R-Type game to introduce new Forces. The game introduced the Shadow Force and Cyclone Force, both of which featured new weapon sets and special enhancements. R-Type III also made a number of enhancements to the weapons and charging systems. The game saw a return to the red-blue-yellow weapon system, as well as replacing the Diffuse Wave Cannon to a standard wave cannon that upon charging shoots a massive beam that clears the entire screen. R-Type III also saw the inclusion of a new cannon, the Hyper Wave Cannon. The only way to access this cannon was to enter Hyper mode and then charge the standard cannon fully. The Hyper Wave Cannon acts like the standard cannon except with rapid fire ability. Also when the cannon is in use, any Bits that the player has collected will spin around the ship during damage to any enemy that draws near. However, the cannon also cause the ship to overheat eventually, leaving a small window where the player can not shoot.Types of ForcesType 1 - Round ForceMain function of Force - 4 Way BlasterColor TypeLaser TypeScreenshotRedAir to Air LaserBlueReflective LaserYellowAir to Ground LaserType 2 - Shadow ForceMain function of Force - Quick return of Force and Ranged BlasterColor TypeLaser TypeScreenshotRedReverse LaserBlueAll Range LaserYellowGuide LaserType 3 - Cyclone DeviceMain function of Force - Active control of Force and Strengthened Cyclone Power AttackColor TypeLaser TypeScreenshotRedThrough LaserBlueSplash LaserYellowCapsule Laser</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2253">Astro Boy: Omega Factor</game><game id="119">Söldner-X: Himmelsstürmer</game><game id="21799">Blazing Star</game><game id="10201">Gradius V</game><game id="5536">Defender</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="7617">Gradius III</game><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="5412">Darius+</game><game id="15999">Darius Twin</game><game id="4252">Last Hope</game><game id="3838">Space Megaforce</game><game id="18519">Phalanx</game><game id="11684">Contra: Shattered Soldier</game><game id="23462">Gradius Gaiden</game><game id="22347">Thunder Force VI</game><game id="6619">Earth Defense Force</game><game id="29408">Chou Jikuu Yousai Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie</game><game id="30856">Dorapan</game><game id="28120">Söldner-X 2: Final Prototype</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game><game id="8261">Rendering Ranger: R2</game><game id="17225">Ziriax</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31029/948618-r_type_iii_coverart.png</image></root>
