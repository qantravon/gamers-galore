Wrapped within a social network of sorts, users could travel from world to world playing games, socializing, rating, and commenting along the way. Since the platform was designed within a web browser all worlds could be accessed through hyper-links, which enabled users to setup advanced features like ad services, rss feeds, and access other web content within their virtual space.Programming for the platform was in Metascript, which was derivative of the Lua programming language. Using Metascript users were able to write their own custom functionality for objects including triggers to open and close doors, create simple AI for pets and enemies, create puzzles, and full games.On 1/1/2010 Metaplace Inc. pulled the plug on the open platform and closed Metaplace Central, which was the central hub of the online universe.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/129802/1783060-5l.jpeg</image></root>
