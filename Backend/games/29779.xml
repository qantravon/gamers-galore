<root><id>29779</id><name>BlazBlue Calamity Trigger Portable</name><description>BlazBlue Calamity Trigger Portable revolves around Ragna the Bloodedge during a postwar where various factions are involved. Ragna is an outlaw and is wanted with a price on his head. You are given the opportunity to expand the story by playing through twelve characters, all with different fighting techniques. Just like in Dissidia: Final Fantasy, each separate story mode fills in certain gaps that a previous character left open. For Guilty Gear fans, this game will truly appeal to you, while novices to the Guilty Gear franchise and BlazBlue will find this game rather time consuming with game modes such as Story mode, Arcade, Campaign and training. Various modes unlock different items such as concept art and "Hint episodes" which resembles an anime series with some of the characters combined with comic relief. </description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6295">Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower</game><game id="22027">Fate/tiger colosseum</game><game id="8680">Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX</game><game id="21802">Guilty Gear Judgment</game><game id="2374">The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga</game><game id="800">Guilty Gear XX Λ Core</game><game id="19278">Guilty Gear XX #Reload</game><game id="24115">Ikki Tousen: Eloquent Fist</game><game id="20616">Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</game><game id="2612">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</game><game id="34218">Chaos Code</game><game id="34082">Skullgirls</game><game id="35719">Ougon Musoukyoku X</game><game id="36051">Ougon Musou Kyoku</game><game id="36274">Persona 4 Arena</game><game id="36947">Ougon Musou Kyoku Cross</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1791141-box_bbctp.png</image></root>
