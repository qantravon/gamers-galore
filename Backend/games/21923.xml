Featuring characters from the first three seasons of the anime, your silent character plays card battles against heroes and villains from the show.As far as games in this franchise are concerned, the most distinguishing feature in this game is the ability to play the Egyptian God Cards, extremely powerful monsters that serve as a plot point throughout the anime and are banned from real-world tournament play. At a certain point in the story, your character has the choice to take either Slifer the Sky Dragon or Obelisk the Tormentor. At a later point in the story, you can trade that card for the Winged Dragon of Ra.</description><genres><genre id="13">Card Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18824">Magic: The Gathering - Battlemage</game><game id="36372">Pok√©mon Card Game: How To Play DS</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2210234-box_ygont.png</image></root>
