According to narrative director Odd Ahlgren, this game is an action game "like 'God of War', but it's a lot more open and you have lots more choice in how to tackle these situations. We're not making an RPG, this isn't about going to the woods and grinding." AionGuard will allow players to fly dragons, and further describes the warriors as a mix of "WWI dogfighter pilots, Samurai, and medieval knights". But instead of swords and aeroplanes, they wield magic.This game can be compared to the look of the Lord of the Rings, but not a traditional RPG, more like Oblivion.AionGuard was announced as being cancelled in Feburary 2010.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4865/860061-edge.jpg</image></root>
