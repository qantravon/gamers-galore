<root><id>4449</id><name>Deal or No Deal</name><description>A game based on the popular Tv shiow of the same name. The DS version is noticeably broken with briefcases that do not properly randomize, instead of each briefcase randomly being assigned a different value the game uses set layouts that are easily recognized by more advance players, in addition to this the game does not randomly generate the first round at all meaning the $10,000 briefcase is the same everytime you boot up the game.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="323">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</game><game id="18254">Wheel of Fortune: Featuring Vanna White</game><game id="24506">Deal or No Deal: The Banker is Back</game><game id="25031">1 vs 100</game><game id="29165">Countdown</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9039/857215-dealpc.jpg</image></root>
