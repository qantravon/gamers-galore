A spin on the usual zero-gracity racer, in this game you control a hovercraft with the goal of protecting a valuable item from clipping into the hands of theives. While dodging enemy fire, you can pass through tunnels and collect fuel capsules. At the end of each level you can visit a shop to upgrade your hydroplane.Critical ReceptionWhen released for the Atari Lynx, Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 7,7,6,7, adding, "...a standard race and chase game that does not offer too much in the wat of innovation. It is kind of fun and the challenge is there, but it did not keep my interest for very long".</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5826">Bimini Run</game><game id="9456">RoadBlasters</game><game id="8949">S.T.U.N.
