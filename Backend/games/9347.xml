This edition set precedent for former collegiate football players to appear on the cover of the game. The game was in many ways a spiritual successor to the other EA Sports College Football franchises, College Football USA and Blll Walsh College Football.The game was released on November 17th 1997, and featured the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner and former University of Florida Quarterback Danny Wuerffel. The game featured all 112 division 1-A teams, the soundtrack also featured fight songs to various different colleges. The most notable feature of this title was the Dynasty Mode, which for the first time allowed players the ability to control a team for up to four seasons. This mode also had a recruiting feature, however it was merely limited to the computer simply simulating the process for you. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20986">Backbreaker</game><game id="22884">NCAA GameBreaker '98</game><game id="31926">College Football USA 97</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2250729-box_ncaafb98.png</image></root>
