Player controls a spaceship that can move left and right and the bottom of the screen that fires up. The ship is equipped with shields activated by a button, which will prevent destruction.   Phoenix was a rare game in its time in that it had 5 stages with 3 unique themes. The first two stages has the player shooting small attacking space birds, reminiscent of Galaxian. The second two stages brought approx 8 large flying eggs that, if not destroyed right away, hatch into large birds that must be shot in the center. Shooting a wing will remove the wing, which can eventually respawn. The final stage is the boss stage featuring a giant mothership that the player must chip away at it's hull eventually destroying the boss in the center of the ship.   Phoenix was quickly ported to the Atari 2600. </description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="2445">Galaxian</game><game id="15784">Galaga</game><game id="8975">Pleiads</game><game id="16120">Space Armada</game><game id="9694">Megamania</game><game id="12834">Alien Invaders - Plus!</game><game id="12744">Chicken Invaders</game><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="13424">Cheesy Invaders</game><game id="1293">CHAMP Invaders</game><game id="13036">Gorf</game><game id="24605">Alien Invader</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/592355-b_phoenix_silver_front.jpg</image></root>
