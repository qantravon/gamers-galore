There is only one control this time around; tap and hold to make the gentleman hold his hat as the wind rushes into take it.The character's thoughts appear in text boxes as he walks, challenging the player to ponder them while not becoming too side-tracked in such tomfoolery as to forget about the wind or miss the subtle signs of its coming.Failures result in the gentleman's comments to the player on the indignity of the situation, a la Herschel Layton.A small child delivers the lost hat to the gentleman and is tipped for his service, a gold coin if the player surpassed the highest distance walked, a silver if not. After a brief comparison of "high score", the walk begins again.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/89356/2424224-winterwalk.png</image></root>
