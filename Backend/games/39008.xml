On either end of the terrain are the main bases for each team. At these bases, players can buy and fetch various emplacements â€” these range from offensive units like cannons, lasers, or missiles to support and defensive structures like shields, mines, and banks. These can then be placed in spots within the player's territory; to expand territory, one must buy and place outposts (essentially static balloons) which expand one's sphere of influence. Money is earned by building banks, or by placing and defending mines upon resource points built into the map.A unique twist to the game is that all emplacements idle until the player comes to control them. By flying up to a building and possessing it, one can aim and fire offensive towers, and upgrade most buildings. Each of these actions is accompanied by a cooldown. Matches end when a player's headquarters are destroyed.AwardsCannon Brawl, won the 2011 Activision Independent Games Competition and joined The PAX 10 at PAX Prime 2012.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8Processor: Any processor with 2 CoresMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or Nvidia Videocard with at least 256MBDirectX: Version 9.0cHard Drive: 1 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: The game is untested on intel cards, but it's likely Intel GMA 950 or newer will workRecommendedOS: Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8Processor: Any processor with 2 CoresMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: ATI or Nvidia Videocard with at least 512MBDirectX: Version 9.0cNetwork: Broadband Internet connectionHard Drive: 1 GB available space</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2266291-screenie1.jpeg</image></root>
