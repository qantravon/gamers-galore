<root><id>2144</id><name>Star Wolves 2</name><description>Overview Star Wolves 2 updates its predecessor in many key areas. Instead of  progressing from mission to mission, you now travel a galaxy of star systems following a main quest line and completing various side quests.  Combat remains largely similar, with the addition of pilots to your mothership (featured on the cover) that gain experience and are leveled up independently. You also now must dock with trade stations in order to trade equipment, reequip your mothership, and level up your pilots. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1403/397616-510_star_wolves_2.jpg</image></root>
