Like                              The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest, the game is a non-canonical "Dream Match" game. The "Striker" system and four-player teams are discarded, while gameplay mechanics feel more like King of Fighters '98.  Heidern,                           King,                          Shingo Yabuki,                         Foxy,                        Lin,                       Bao,                      Hinako Shijo, and                    Li Xiangfei  from the previous installment are absent as playable characters, as well as                   Jhun Hoon and                  Kasumi Todoh. Though,  King and Shingo return (with no team association) in the console versions. The game also features a series of teams representing each of the previous King of Fighters games from                The King of Fighters '96 to               The King of Fighters 2001, returning              Mature,             Vice,            Yashiro Nanakase,           Shermie,          Chris,         Ryuji Yamazaki,        Billy Kane, and the final boss,       Rugal Bernstein.     Goenitz,    Geese Howard, and the cursed version of   Iori Yagami also make their return in some console versions as secret characters. Like The King of Fighters '98, the game was considered one of the more competitive-friendly installments of the franchise. The game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, a well as later remade under the name                             The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match.
