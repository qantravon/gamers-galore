The game is heavily influenced by Bible and Christian mythology. The background story to the game is set in heaven. God was not satisfied with his creation – The Earth. Some of the angels in heaven thought that they should descend onto Earth and interpret God’s presumed desires. These angels are called The Fallen. You take control of Malachi. An angel and servant of God. You have to stop The Fallen angels and avert the apocalypse. The game is a standard first-person shooter although you can use some special powers (in similar manner to Jedi Knight) like slowing down time or possessing an enemy.
