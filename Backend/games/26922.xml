There is a high-level strategy management angle where units are selected and placed before a battle. Once this is complete, the battle itself will start and go to a ground-level, turn-based strategy game to decide the battle.While most of the game is reasonably historically accurate, there will be occasional powerups during a specific battle, as well as the ability to level up certain units during the course of the campaign.PlatformsThe game debuted as a PSN download for PSP in 2010. In 2012 Enigma announced they had signed a deal with Matrix Games and Slitherine Software to publish both download and retail versions of the game for PS3, PS Vita, Xbox 360 and PC.ExtrasAs of 06/05/09, no specific downloadable extras have been announced.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4563">Field Commander</game><game id="20739">Tom Clancy's EndWar</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/30196/1794778-patton.jpg</image></root>
