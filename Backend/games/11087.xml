<root><id>11087</id><name>Hopper</name><description>Like Frogger, in Hopper the player must navigate through four lanes of highway traffic without getting hit by cars and trucks. After successfully navigating through the traffic the player must then navigate through a river by hopping across two lanes of logs to reach five cells that the player must reach before the game clock expires. Once all five cells have been reached the game re-starts, but slightly harder. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5641">Moorfrosch</game><game id="11903">Frogger</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
