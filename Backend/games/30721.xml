<root><id>30721</id><name>ASO: Armored Scrum Object</name><description>ASO is a scrolling shooter with segregated weapons similar to Xevious.Â  Missiles are used to destroy ground enemies, while laser-like weapons  are used for aerial opponents. Throughout each of the levels, one or two players  must fight off waves of enemies that threaten several space stations.  A  battle against a boss takes place at the end of each stage. The  player's craft can be upgraded by collecting power-ups, as well as by  collecting pieces of armor which can only be activated when the player  collects enough energy.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18942">Alpha Mission</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17391/1328798-aso_flyer.jpg</image></root>
