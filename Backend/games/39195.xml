It is an official reboot of Rise of the Triad: Dark War, bringing the fast movement, insane weapons, crazy power-ups, and ludicrous gibs to the modern Unreal Engine 3.Players take the role of one of five members of a team of special operatives, known as the High-risk United Nations Taskforce (or HUNT, for short), as they investigate terrorist activity taking place in San Nicolas Island (off the coast of California, United States). When their only ride out of the island explodes into flames, they must infiltrate the island to stop the rogue organization known as the Triad, killing everything that moves.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP or Vista 32-bitProcessor: 2.4 GHz Dual Core Processor or BetterMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: ATI Radeon HD 3870 / NVIDIA 8800 GTDirectX®: 9.0Hard Drive: 5 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX CompatibleRecommendedOS: Windows 7 64-bitProcessor: 2.4 GHz Quad Core Processor or BetterMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: AMD Radeon HD 6950 / NVIDIA GTX 560DirectX®: 9.0Hard Drive: 5 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42610">Shadow Warrior</game><game id="5793">Gloom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2489843-box_rott.png</image></root>
