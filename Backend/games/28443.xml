Like the Taito published arcade game Half Life 2: survivor in that it was intended as a introduction to the Counter-Strike series for the Japanese market. The game is developed by Namco with use of the Half-Life licence from Valve. Differences with other versions of Counter-StrikeCS: Neo's gameplay is much the same as any other game in the Counter-Strike series in that it is played from a first person perspective and involves objective based combat between two teams. Stylistically, the game is unlike any other entry in the Counter-Strike series. It replaces the original modification's focus on modern warfare between terrorists and counter-terrorists in relatively realistic settings with animé-inspired futuristic aesthetics.  Despite this change, all of the weapons models in Neo are taken from Counter-Strike: Source.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22721">Half Life 2: Survivor</game><game id="32288">Sudden Attack</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/35841/1151185-css_neo.jpg</image></root>
