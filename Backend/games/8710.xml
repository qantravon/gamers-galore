The player can choose from historically accurate 1988 presidential election candidates George HW Bush (for Republicans) and Michael Dukakis (for Democrats) as well as real-life political figures involved in the 1988 election - Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson. They can also select between a fictional representation of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called "Sasha", and "Suzuki", a Japanese-American senator from California with a pro-Japan platform presumably intended to appeal to the game's entirely Japanese audience.The player must campaign by selecting issues and declaring which side of the debate they are in favor in of order to earn more and more voter popularity as the elections close in.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3371">The Political Machine</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/558335-america_daitouryou_senkyo_box.jpg</image></root>
