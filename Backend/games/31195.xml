The aim of the game is to clear all of the buildings in order to land your biplane safely. As the plane travels across the screen the player is able to drop bombs, with a direct hit on any building partially destroying it and reducing it's height. When the plane exits to the right of the screen after a pass it reappears on the left hand side, but at a slightly lower height. This continues until the player either crashes into a building, or all of the buildings are destroyed, allowing the player to land safely and win the game. At this point the player is rewarded with an animated wave from the pilot before he takes off again for another round.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63074/1363833-blitzs.png</image></root>
