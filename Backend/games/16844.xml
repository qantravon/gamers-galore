The game was released in November, 1991 for the  PC (MS-DOS). It was developed by  id Software (of  Doom and  Wolfenstein 3D fame), and was released by  FormGen, Inc.StoryUnlike the previous numbered Commander Keen games, Aliens Ate My Babysitter! does not belong to a trilogy, nor is it part of a direct storyline continuity. The basic plot of the game features series villain  Mortimer McMire teaming up with aliens called Bloogs in order to kidnap  Commander Keen's babysitter (named Molly). Keen must rush to save his babysitter and simultaneously stop the evil McMire from destroying the universe.GameplayLike the rest of the Commander Keen series, Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a classic platformer, where the player must avoid or destroy enemies while avoiding obstacles and collecting powerups and score tokens (such as popsicles). Aliens Ate My Babysitter was particularly notable for the great number of glitches, causing players to randomly fall through platforms or causing the game to freeze and crash during saving.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20021">Duke Nukem II</game><game id="8191">Duke Nukem</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2352/219812-keen6_boxart.jpg</image></root>
