Fortunately, there is a menu option to play the game in regular 2D for player who don't own the peripheral.Unlike the original Zaxxon, the game takes a "behind the ship" viewpoint, similar to that of Space Harrier, rather the original Arcade game's isometric perspective. Otherwise, it is largely identical to Sega's venerable shooter - simply shoot down enemies, avoid obstacles such as walls by flying over them and defeat bosses at the end of each level.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1209025-tumblr_ku70lhoszm1qzurbto1_500.jpg</image></root>
