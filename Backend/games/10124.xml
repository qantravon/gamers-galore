Both cities are large and full of cars driving the city streets, police cars patrolling, and pedestrians strolling the sidewalks.  There are approximately 42 vehicles to choose from in Midnight Club: Street Racing all of which are based on real life car models, but aren't officially licensed. The game has you free-roaming through city streets, looking for other racers (visible on your mini-map) to find and compete against in numerous races.  When you have found another racer, you can activate a race against that driver and his gang with the reward being that driver's vehicle being added to your collection. The career mode is also filled with countless secrets that can be found throughout each city and add to the overall short length of career mode. The game modes consist of checkpoint races, a joyride mode, and capture the flag, as well as featuring multiplayer for up to two players.
