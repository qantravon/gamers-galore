You can play as either the Kingdom or the Norse against an AI opponent or people over Xbox Live and Local. The object of the game is to destroy your opponent's castle or capture his flag using a variety of units, spells, and projectiles all of which have 10 upgrade levels. You can customize your castle with different rooms that dictate what passive bonuses and troops you have access to in game.The game has a campaign mode as well which slowly introduces players to the different units, spells, and projectiles and follows the story of Gareth as he tries to recapture the Kingdom's stolen gem.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP/Windows Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8Processor: Single Core CPU @ 1.6GHzMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: GeForce 6600 / Radeon 9800 / Intel HD 2000DirectX®: 9.0Hard Drive: 500 MB HD spaceSound: DirectX compatible sound cardRecommendedOS: Windows XP/Windows Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8Processor: Dual Core CPU @ 2.00GHzMemory: 1024 MB RAMGraphics: GeForce 8600 / Radeon HD 3670 / Intel HD 4000DirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 800 MB HD spaceSound: DirectX compatible sound cardOther Requirements: Broadband Internet connection</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30199">Angry Birds</game><game id="23377">Swords &amp; Soldiers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2488289-box_cstorm.png</image></root>
