In an attempt to change the tide of war and take the battle to the enemy the Terran military body, Galactic Command (GALCOM), has launched an all out attack on the Gammulan homeworlds.The events that take place in Angle Of Attack occur during the final days of the air campaign of the assault on LV-115 - an important planet used by the Gammulans for military purposes and as a staging area for their assault on GALCOM forces.The GALCOM forces, locked in a lopsided air campaign, made the decision to load the 'planet killer' R.A.N.D.O.M. weapon aboard the GCV-Excalibur for its ill-fated mission.PC System RequirementsMinimumCPU: Intel PentiumÂ® 4 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon XP 2800+RAM: 1 GBVGA: 256MB GPU with Shader Model 3 nVidia GeForce 7900 / ATI Radeon X1300 or fasterDX: DirectX 9.0 March 2009 RuntimeOS: Windows XP or Windows VistaHDD: 600 MBSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible (on-board or add-in)Network: Multiplayer requires LAN or broadband connectionRecommendedCPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6320 or better, AMD Phenom X2 5000+ or betterRAM: 2 GBVGA: 512MB GPU with Shader Model 3 (nVidia GeForce 8600 GTS / Radeon HD2900 XT or faster)DX: DirectX 9.0 March 2009 RuntimeOS: Windows XP or Windows VistaHDD: 600 MBSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible (on-board or add-in)Network: Multiplayer requires LAN or broadband connection</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1872/1101802-headesr.jpg</image></root>
