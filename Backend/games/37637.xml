Wrath of the Dead Rabbit</name><description>OverviewHell Yeah is an action platformer where players play as the prince of hell attempting to get back "intimate photos" by killing 100 monsters. These Monsters are essentially minibosses and each one has a wario-ware style minigame attached to it.StoryAfter the death of the previous king of Hell, skeleton rabbit Prince of Hell, Ash, takes over. But after he does, nude photos of him playing in the bath pop up online and 100 monsters saw it. Now Ash must KILL all of those monsters and prove that himself a fearsome leader. He has to travel Hades and take out all that stand in his way.GameplayHell Yeah is an action platformer that could been seen as a sort of metroidvania, in that there is some travelling back and forth across each level. Ash moves around using a circular saw/jet pack. There are also projectile weapons, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and machine guns as well. When taking down the 100 monsters, just before killing them a Warioware-style minigame pops up where the player has to quickly pump up a balloon, or pull back an arrow. When done successfully is triggers the over-the-top death scene for that monster.PC System RequirementsMimimum:Windows XP/Vista/Win7Intel Core 2 DUO @ 2.4 GHz/Athlon 64 X2 4200+  above1 GB RAM (2 GB on Vista)a DirectX 10 compatible graphic card with at least 512 MBDirectX 9c (10 on Vista)2 GB Free on Hard DriveLinksDevelopment Blog</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7634">Jazz Jackrabbit</game><game id="2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="11133">Earthworm Jim</game><game id="18540">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2339307-box_hellyeah.png</image></root>
