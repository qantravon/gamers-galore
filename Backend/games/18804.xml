<root><id>18804</id><name>Mankind</name><description>One of the first Massively Multiplayer Online games with a single, persistent world.  In Mankind you begin as a small organization, which colonizes a single protected planet using a single ship and modest resources.  The goal is to upgrade your Empire to the point where it becomes competitive, then to colonize worlds outside the protected areas where other players are also trying to do the same.  Players who are offline still garner resources and are still vulnerable to attack, although recent changes have tried to make attacking offline players less profitable.Players are also allowed to set up distributor stations that allow them to make money off of the goods they mine, similar to idling in the marketplace in Everquest and other online games.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
