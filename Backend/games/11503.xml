<root><id>11503</id><name>Wizard</name><description> Gameplay The player navigates the wizard, Wilfrid, through each level to collect the keys to move on to the next stage. To find the keys, Wilfrid must use the spells at his disposal and avoid or kill his enemies. His spells included freezing or killing projectiles, teleportation, and invisibility. Features  Wizard shared similar gameplay mechanics with the    Epyx title,   Jumpman, but set itself apart with the ability to cast spells, and the inclusion of a construction set. The construction set allowed players to create new levels, however the construction set was unable to recreate the event driven environment changes that had been hard coded into the official levels.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11821">Ultimate Wizard</game><game id="14094">Jumpman Jr.</game><game id="14172">Jumpman Lives!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/623391-572267_33371_front_1_.jpg</image></root>
