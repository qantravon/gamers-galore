<root><id>2347</id><name>Call of Duty 2</name><description>Overview     Call of Duty 2 is the second game in        Infinity Ward's        series, published by        Activison. You play the role of several soldiers, each a member of either the  British, Russian or United States army, and fight the    Nazis in locations all across    Europe,  North Africa and        Russia. Each of the game's locations are based on actual        WWII battles. Players are presented with a radar        HUD in the bottom left of the screen which contains information such as  objective points, enemy positions and direction of travel. Most of the objectives consist of things like placing a        bomb on a pesky      panzer tank, destroying a        mortar, clearing buildings of Axis soldiers or simply reaching the next        checkpoint. There are several instances where one can choose in what order  to complete the mission objectives. The player may carry two weapons at any time and up to 4 frag and 4        smoke grenades. At the beginning of each mission the player is often armed with a        machine gun for close combat and a        rifle for fighting at a distance. Either of the weapons can be swapped for weapons found strewn across the battlefield, some of the better equipment is often scavenged from the corpses of the Nazis. The player can also make use of a melee attack when in close quarters. Preparing for D-Day     Call of Duty offers some degree of tactics which often combine a use of        grenades with advancing to cover and using one of the three degrees of elevation (standard upright, crouching or crawling). The player character is also able to jump which is useful for negotiating debris. Much of the gameplay in COD2 revolves around reaching the next checkpoint. There are frequent examples of        infinitely spawning enemies which can only be overcome by advancing to a certain position so that the friendly        AI units take up a new position. The inclusion of infinitely spawning enemies shapes the way the player will take on many of the challenges in COD2, running and gunning into the fray is often the only option available. Although this provides fast paced, action packed gameplay it can sometimes spoil the sense of realism the title strives to achieve.  Campaign Locations Call of Duty 2 has three separate campaigns each of which is split into battles which each have their own component chapters:Russian Missions1: THE WINTER WAR.

The player has access to unique weapons such as the Grease Gun, that are not available in the single player game. The game includes, CTF, TDM, Search and Destroy and Headquarters for modes. The game also includes multiple maps, based on locations from the campaign. Many Player made maps have been created using the free to download Mod tools provided by Infinity Ward. The Map decides what factions fight each other, and what weapons are available to players. Two additional maps (Rostov and Wallendar)  were added as part of a free update. Players on Call of Duty PC servers often refrain from using smoke grenades because using them can sometimes cause a server crash. On the Console versions,    Certain maps are marked as 'Unbalanced", these maps are referred to as such because they are designed in such a way that one team is put at a disadvantage, consistently, regardless of whos playing. * Players could play in a match and on the PC version up to 64 may play at one time.
