SEE Virtual Worlds designer Josh Gordon stated "We put a focus on something that will truly allow fans to immerse  themselves in a Michael Jackson-like universe or music-video-like world  and interact with each other and then go on adventures and do gameplay  stuff and socialize." The estate of Michael Jackson released a statement saying that "We believe this online social gaming experience will bring the most  passionate Michael Jackson fans together with those just discovering his  artistry in a unique environment where they can celebrate his music,  his art and his devotion to helping those in need." GameplaySpecifics of the gameplay and what the player will actually spend time on remain unclear for the time being. When explaining what the player does in the game, Gordon said "The player is more apt to succeed in a situation using song, dance and adventure as opposed to violence." Therefore, it is likely that the gameplay would center around more lighthearted tasks similar to games such as    Free Realms.   It is known that players will have customizable avatars, and some clothing will likely be inspired by the more famous outfits that Jackson used in his live performances and music videos. Planet Michael will also feature some items that can be purchased with real money through  microtransactions.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11660/1530477-planet_michael_logo_w_taglinefinal.jpg</image></root>
