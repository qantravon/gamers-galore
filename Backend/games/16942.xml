The three castes are Bacrumese, the upper class people of the land, Gargastan, diverse common making up the majority of the people in Valeria, and Walstanian which are a oppressed minority who live in the most southern part of Valeria.Normal InterfaceMany years ago Valeria flourished as a trade port, however war brewed between ethnic groups, each vying for political control. This continued for years until Dolgare, a man desiring peace and unity, rose to power, becoming the King of the entire island. In order to assure feuds would be eradicated, he set up an official religion and encouraged inter-ethnic marriages. He spent much of his time quelling arguments and altercation. His reign lasted for half a century.After King Dolgare's death, the leader of the Bacrumese, Bishop Branta, dominated the aristocrat class. With Bishop Branta in command and military support from Lodis, a major country north of Valeria, the Bacrumese declared the independence of the capital city of Heigm, establishing Bacrum-Valeria. Branta proposed conquering the entire island, however this was subjugated by the leader of the Dark Knight Order of Roslolian, Lans Tartare, as he did not want to waste military power by having a "useless war". Thus Branta was forced to yield to Lans Tartare's objection, giving up the invasion.In-Town CloseupThe South part of Valeria, was split into two main groups; Gargastan which made up seventy percent of the population which supported the nationalist movement lead by Barbatos, and Walstanians which covered about ten percent of the population. The Gargastan people declared war against the Walstanians. The Walstanians, being outnumbered seven to one, were massacred. Duke Ronway was made ruler of Walsta and for half of a year he lead its people in defense against the Gargastans to no avail. Walsta was defeated and Cardinal Barbatos established the Gargatan Kingdom. Despite Barbatos attempts to stop the internal disputes, the oppression of Walstanians never ceased.What remained of the Walsta fought back against the Gargastan Kingdom until Duke Ronway was captured. Duke Ronway's imprisonment left Walsta's people desperate, and many moved into a Walsta self-governing district which was provided by the Gargastans.The game starts in the port town of Griate, the player takes control of Denim, a soldier of the Walsta Liberation Army.Gameplay MechanicsItem ManagementLiken to other tactical turn-based RPGs, the player has a team of several characters with negotiable classes.
