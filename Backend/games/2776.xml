The game has only 8 circuits, but cycles through them repeatedly, for a total of 85 races. Each cycle gets progressively more difficult by the addition of new obstacles, such as oil slicks and tornadoes. Wrenches could be obtained during races, which could then be used to upgrade the player's car in-between races. Upgrading the car allowed a certain degree of customization, since the car's traction, speed, and acceleration were upgrading independently.In arcades, the game could be played by up to three human players. The arcade version was controlled with a steering wheel and foot pedal.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19945">Indy 500</game><game id="6017">Super Cars</game><game id="1166">Badlands</game><game id="5615">Grand Prix Simulator</game><game id="10491">Radio Controlled Racer</game><game id="2265">5th Gear</game><game id="13854">BMX Simulator</game><game id="16376">Carnage</game><game id="15374">Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat</game><game id="9509">Ivan "Iron Man" Stewart's Super Off Road</game><game id="26243">Little Racers</game><game id="6234">Hot Rod</game><game id="2983">International Truck Racing</game><game id="1659">Jupiter's Masterdrive</game><game id="13167">Karting Grand Prix</game><game id="1851">Championship Sprint</game><game id="5748">GeneRally</game><game id="28073">Rush Rush Rally Racing</game><game id="37539">Battle Cross</game><game id="4531">Super Skidmarks</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2368585-super_sprint_nes.jpg</image></root>
