There is only one storyline and one ending, defined as a "kinetic novel" by its developers.  Other than the protagonist-and-narrator, there is only one other character - Yumemi Hoshino - a vicarious android attendant designed to appear as a young girl for the purpose of working in exhibitions of a defunct planetarium.  This poignant tale tells the story of the scavenger in a dead city who stumbles upon Yumemi Hoshino and the planetarium - two of the last remaining symbols of the time before the post-apocalyptic reality in which he lives. While learning more and more about the past as Yumemi recounts her many stories from her history with the planetarium before the fallout, the junker's curiosity brings him to begin a pursuit of repairing the planetarium projector so that he may witness Yumemi's exhibition proper and catch a first-hand look at an experience that marveled others long before his time.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23249">Clannad</game><game id="8059">Kanon</game><game id="23250">Air</game><game id="23251">Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life</game><game id="23253">Rewrite</game><game id="23252">Little Busters!</game><game id="29281">Akatsuki no Amaneka to Aoi Kyojin: Pashiate Bunmei Kenkyuukai Koubouki</game><game id="29700">Misshitsu no Sacrifice</game><game id="29233">Disgaea Infinite</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2410691-b1.png</image></root>
