Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the "Madman" himself.GameplayThe game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles, to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The Apache AH-64 has limited room inside, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary These objectives aren't always linear, and can often times be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated it from many of the other shooters of that period.There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the Apache AH-64: machine guns, hydra missiles and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission, or resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the Apache AH-64 only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.Lives are lost when either the Apache AH-64 takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.PortsDue to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995 Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13618">Red Zone</game><game id="22479">Seek and Destroy</game><game id="22746">Firehawk</game><game id="24576">Exisled</game><game id="12724">Return Fire</game><game id="2180">Jungle Strike</game><game id="2422">Soviet Strike</game><game id="9336">Urban Strike</game><game id="14485">Future Cop LAPD</game><game id="34619">Renegade Ops</game><game id="18670">A.S.P.: Air Strike Patrol</game><game id="111">Choplifter II: Rescue Survive</game><game id="32097">Top Gun: Firestorm</game><game id="21690">MechWarrior 3050</game><game id="41504">Blue Skies</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370498-genesis_desertstrike_2__1_.jpg</image></root>
