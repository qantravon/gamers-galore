The game was developed for over 6 months as an entry into the Independent Games Festival Student Showcase at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. The game follows the eponymous Octodad, an octopus masquerading as a human who must collect items throughout his house in order to build a mannequin to avoid dinner with his wife.DownloadThe game can be downloaded for free on its official website:http://octodadgame.comGameplayCleaning out the fridge.Octodad's gameplay is centered on the challenge of moving throughout the environment and interacting with various objects. Movement of Octodad's limbs is complex, using spacebar or the middle mouse button, the player moves between an arm mode and a leg mode. In the leg mode, holding the left mouse button and dragging will move Octodad's left foot, and the right mouse button moves the right foot. Alternating between the left and right feet in quick succession will allow the player to move around the environment or do various tasks with his feet such as kicking a soccer ball or squishing spiders. In the hand mode, the mouse moves the arm around. Clicking the right mouse button and dragging will move the arm up and down and left clicking will pick an object up. Many tasks in the game require the player to switch between modes, such as picking up a toy and bringing it across the room.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1109">Trespasser: Jurassic Park</game><game id="35026">QWOP</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117704/1632923-cover.jpg</image></root>
