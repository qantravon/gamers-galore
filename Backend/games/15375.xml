The game is the fourth entry in the Tengai Makyou franchise and is the only game in the series to be released for the Super Famicom.Tengai Makyou Zero lacks the CG cut-scenes, voice acting, and CD quality music that Tengai Makyou is known for but its presentation is still able to compete with the high standards of the franchise. This is thanks to the game being stored in a hefty 40mbit cartridge as well as being equipped with a special decompression chip, the SPC7110. The SPC7110 chip was designed by the Seiko Epson Corporation and was able to compress 72mbit of data into the 40mbit cartridge. Zero's cartridge also has an internal battery that powers a real world clock which unlocks special time specific events in the game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10392">Paladin's Quest</game><game id="8307">EarthBound</game><game id="19425">Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation</game><game id="13774">Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</game><game id="12620">Aurora Quest: Otaku no Seiza in Another World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/59247/1130183-tm0.jpg</image></root>
