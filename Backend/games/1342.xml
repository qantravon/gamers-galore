Zoids Legacy is a lengthy RPG game that fuses the core concepts of    Pokémon with the theme of giant robots called zoids. The player takes on the role of a young zoid pilot that has to brush up on his fighting skills, make some new friends as well as enemies, collect different components to build stronger zoids and explore a world map of considerable size. Combat is executed in turns and can involve up to twelve zoids at the same time in six-on-six configuration. Before attacking the player can choose from a wide variety of battle commands, which are special abilities that can be used once per fight. When all the attack commands are confirmed players are awarded with a neat animation of the actions they decided to take.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478712-box_zl.png</image></root>
