<root><id>154</id><name>187: Ride or Die</name><description>187 Ride or Die is undoubtedly a game that was born out of the popularity of Grand Theft Auto, however unlike many games of the ilk, 187 doesn't try to ape the style of Rockstar's opus: rather than a sandbox game it's essentially a racing game where your car has guns. The goal of each event alternates between simply crossing the finish line to defeating rival cars. Upon release, the game was critically panned. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20454">50 Cent: Blood on the Sand</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803102-box_187rod.png</image></root>
