You can completely control the helicopter realistically and there are various modes for simple flight practice on to full on combat with hostile targets.    The helicopter is equipped with a machine gun, rockets and guided missiles in order to take out hostile targets. Each weapon has a different effective range and amount of damage it inflicts so finding the right weapon for each situation is required.    The game was one of the few of the time to use the dreaded  lenslok protection system that used a physical prism to rearrange a code displayed on the screen that had to be entered.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1363479-tomahawk_loading.gif</image></root>
