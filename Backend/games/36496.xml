The game featured black-and-white sprite graphics with the controls inside a set of plastic boxing gloves attached to the arcade cabinet. Critics have since identified it as the first video game to feature hand-to-hand fighting, though it differs from subsequent martial arts themed fighting games.Like later fighting games, it was viewed from a side-view perspective. Besides being the first fighting game, it was also notable for its imaginative control system. It employed two boxing glove controllers, one for each player, which moved up and down for high and low punches, with an inward movement for striking. The game's large sprite character graphics was also detailed for its time.In 1987, there was a remake released, which changed the side view perspective of the original game to a third-person perspective, much like Nintendo's Punch-Out, which in bares some resemblance to Sega's original 1976 game.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32574">Gun Fight</game><game id="27410">Punch-Out!!</game><game id="7250">Karate Champ</game><game id="44162">KO Punch</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1909674-hc.jpg</image></root>
