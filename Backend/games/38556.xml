Designed for younger players, it lets players learn spells and go on adventures in the Harry Potter universe all thanks to the Playstation Eye, the Playstation Move and a cardboard book (the WonderBook).StoryThe game is divided into small stories and poems all set in the Harry Potter universe. The game is narrated by Miranda Goshawk, a prominent author in the Harry Potter universe. Players get to choose at the beginning of the game which house they want to belong to (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw) by choosing a wand and are then free to choose a story.Players can complete stories in whichever order they want to. Each story is set in well known Harry Potter environments and involves mythical creatures from the universe.GameplayThree different things are needed in order to play Book of Spells (other than a PS3): a Playstation Eye, a Playstation Move and the Wonder Book. Players show the different codes on the WonderBook to the Playstation Eye, thus making words appear on the book (onscreen). The book is used for the story sections (the player selects stories through the onscreen menu).You're in the game!The book illustrates story scenes and teaches the player new spells. The Playstation Move is used as the player's wand. Each story teaches the player a new spell, which he must do by moving the wand in a certain manner (sometimes doing a spell requires writing a word in the air).Thanks to the Playstation Eye, the game makes things appear in the virtual reality of the player. Frogs can appear on the player's head or the player can appear directly in the scene.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="38572">Diggs Nightcrawler</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2349656-spells.png</image></root>
