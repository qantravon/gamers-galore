<root><id>40161</id><name>Bakutoushi Patton-Kun</name><description>OverviewBakutoushi Patton-Kun (roughly "Explosive Fighter Patton") is a multiplayer action game where the goal is to blow up the tanks of the other players in a series of arenas, similar to Atari's Combat. As well as destroying each opponent's tank, the player must also defeat the tank's driver as they run around defenselessly. After defeating all the other tanks and their drivers, the player moves onto the next stage.The game will, at one point during the loading process (as Famicom Disk System games ran on disks), ask the player to "Turn to Side B and Insert to Fucking Box!" It is the only type of bomb found in the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5368">Combat</game><game id="6406">Battle City</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2349316-bakutoushi_patton_kun_jp.jpg</image></root>
