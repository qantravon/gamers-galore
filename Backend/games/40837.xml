The major differences is that on top of the same characters from before, it added characters from the Gento story and from the Shura story with additional game modes that can be chosen.GameplayThe game plays exactly like that last arcade game where the player picks a difficulty level and fight through the main characters from the franchise using the 6 punch pads and dropping the enemy's heath whilst gaining power to unleash the player's signature move.One of the extra additions is that there is also a 2 player co-op mode via 2 cabinets connected to each other. Upon selecting this option, there are 3 paired characters that can be chosen:Kenshiro and ReiBat and EinKenshiro and RaohThe stages involve fighting a pair of boss characters who for some characters switch places to attack both players.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="20">Boxing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39179">Fighting Mania: Fist of the North Star</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2387874-1191391006.jpg</image></root>
