Everyone also assumed that the  Xbox version of the game was also canceled. But for reasons unknown they decided to release the Xbox version exclusively at Costco stores.              Midway refused to discuss the game, or even acknowledge its existence, so it will most likely never be known why they decided to release it. SoundtrackThe soundtrack features several rap songs recorded specifically for the game. Interestingly the song's lyrics mentions the names of the programmers and developers who worked on the game. Unfortunately none of the rappers are credited by name, instead they appear as "special guest rappers" in the credits.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9243">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX</game><game id="5474">BMX XXX</game><game id="2341">Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</game><game id="43025">Motorbike</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2543556-box_ggbsvd.png</image></root>
