The album explores themes of nature and technology, which are further expounded upon in the app, available on iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. It was originally released on July 19, 2011 with the songs Crystalline and Cosmogony. The app itself is free, but each song other than Cosmogony will cost $1.99. It is possible, however, to buy the entire album's worth of in-app content for $9.99. Cosmogony The Cosmogony part of the app isn't as interactive as the rest. It features the song, an animation, and some other extras.Crystalline The first track, Crystalline, allows players to dynamically arrange their own version of the song. By collecting crystals and choosing which paths to go down, the player unlocks more tunnels to explore and informs the structure of the music they hear.  The track features wireframe graphics and simple geometric shapes, in a style not entirely unlike Rez.Other Tracks New tracks will be released twice a month.
