<root><id>6784</id><name>Tyrian 2000</name><description>Digital DistributionTyrian 2000 was re-released by  Good Old Games with compatibility  support for Windows XP, Vista, and 7 for both 32 and 64-bit. It was given away initially as a free gift for Holiday 2010. This despite the game being freely available and open-source online at http://code.google.com/p/opentyrian/. It is good however that the game has been re-released via an "official" channel, allowing many who would otherwise not know of its existence to experience what is regarded as a great old-school shooter by many.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16253">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</game><game id="16693">Raiden</game><game id="5962">Raiden II</game><game id="413">Raiden III</game><game id="14539">Astro Warrior</game><game id="27556">Space Invaders Infinity Gene</game><game id="499">Tyrian</game><game id="14837">The Reap</game><game id="35611">Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony</game><game id="17782">Xenon 2: Megablast</game><game id="32864">ProtoGalaxy</game><game id="10744">OverKill</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2593/271651-tyrian_2000_ss1.gif</image></root>
