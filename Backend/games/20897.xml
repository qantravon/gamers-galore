The most obvious of which is that the dragon has two forms of firepower: A fireball that hits aerial enemies and a bomb that hits ground-based enemies.The dragon can power up by collecting eggs: Red eggs will increase the power of the dragon's fire breath while the blue eggs allow him to grow an additional head, effectively doubling its damage output as well as increasing the coverage. It's possible to have up to three heads in total. In addition, there are also various weapon power-ups that provide a temporary boon such as larger flame spouts or enemy-seeking fireballs.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25613">1944: The Loop Master</game><game id="29829">Dangerous Seed</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365528-tg16_dragonspirit.jpg</image></root>
