Available through Steam it has career based achievements and newly integrated Workshop support offering easy access to user created scenarios. Also features the infamously long list of DLC ranging from cheaper trains and scenarios to more expensive routes. All previously owned DLC is compatible and will also carry forward to newer versions.Gameplay remains similar with a slightly refreshed driving UI and offers the player opportunity to drive route based scenarios and ranked career missions that range in complexity and time as well as an objective free quick drive mode where any train can be used on any route. You can choose from both 'simple' and 'realistic' driving controls allowing anyone to essentially pick up and play, now further encouraged by the addition of controller support.New FeaturesDrive with Xbox 360 controller, keyboard or mouse'Relay' multiplayer missions allowing two players to co-operate to complete objectivesQuick Drive menu system: drive what you like, where you likeScore your driving and join the global leader board with Career SystemInteractive maps and task listsEnhanced graphics and performanceGameplayEach route comes with several scenario or career missions that can focus on delivering passengers or hauling freight depending on the train and section of the line. Both types include a list of objectives such as a timetable and stops for passenger missions or managing loading and coupling of rolling stock for freight. Missions come with varying levels of difficulty and length, ranging from 15 minutes up to 2 hours. While simply completing objectives will pass scenario missions, career missions will score you based on adherence to rules, providing bonuses for prompt completion of objectives but penalizing for ignoring signals, exceeding the speed limit, wheel slippage and even ride comfort. A quick drive mode allows you to pick from any train and route you own and drive free from objectives.Trains come with fully modeled and dynamic cabin interiors, able to be driven with the mouse interacting with the levels, the keyboard or a controller. 'Simple' driving controls only use accelerating and braking on a single lever but the standard 'Realistic' controls generally include acceleration, direction and braking on separate levers for electric and diesel trains. Steam engines have similar controls with extra options for managing steam and coal able to be automated.Included Trains  RoutesLondon to BrightonThe London to Brighton route recreates the modern 50-mile third rail electrified route from London Victoria Station to Brighton Station, with all stations along the way including Clapham Junction and landmarks including Battersea Power Station, London Gatwick Airport, Brighton  Hove Albion stadium and Brighton Lovers Walk depot to Brighton and includes the Class 377 Electrostar.Isle of WightThe Isle of Wight route recreates the picturesque holiday island 8.5 mile Ryde Pier Head to Shanklin line running the Class 483; these ex-London Underground trains have been given a new lease of life on the Isle of Wight and are the oldest trains in mainline service anywhere in the UK.
