Each piece is brought to life by adding comical animations to them, moving across the board and violently attacking one another.Depending what piece attacks which, different attack comes into play. For example: if the player takes a knight with a knight he will cut his enemy limb from limb until all that is left is a bloody mess; however, if the player's knight gets close enough to take the queen he will cleverly dodge her incoming attacks and deflect her magic back upon her.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3036">Archon: The Light and the Dark</game><game id="18713">Chess Player 2150</game><game id="4">The Chessmaster 2000</game><game id="19195">Chessmaster 10th Edition</game><game id="23239">Cadillac</game><game id="20047">Checkmate</game><game id="18763">Disney's Aladdin Chess Adventures</game><game id="20493">Chessmaster: The Art of Learning</game><game id="8517">Star Wars Chess</game><game id="11752">The Chessmaster</game><game id="14771">Virtual Chess 64</game><game id="16214">The Fidelity Ultimate Chess Challenge</game><game id="4342">Online Chess Kingdoms</game><game id="11488">Learn To Play Chess with Fritz &amp; Chesster</game><game id="876">Dark Legions</game><game id="13903">Sargon III</game><game id="27217">Reversi</game><game id="18194">Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Chess Wars</game><game id="24959">Archon Classic</game><game id="37291">Hero Academy</game><game id="31919">Check vs. Mate</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11423/1293119-battle_chess_box_art.jpg</image></root>
