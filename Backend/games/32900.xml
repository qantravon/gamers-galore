<root><id>32900</id><name>Just Dance Kids</name><description>Overview Just Dance Kids plays similar to other entries in the franchise but simplifies dance moves and adds other "fun" modes to appeal to children. A Continuous Play mode lets parents start the game and not have to return to navigate through menus for their children, Shake and Freeze mode only requires players to wildly shake the Wii Remote or remain perfectly still, and Team Play combines all players' scores so no one argues over who won. Parents can also track calories burned, time played, and view a history of which songs their kids played the most.Tracklist Over 40 songs are included in Just Dance Kids with a healthy mix of licensed pop tracks, kids' TV show theme songs, and classroom standards. Other than the songs by The Wiggles and Yo Gabba Gabba, all songs that appear in the game are cover versions re-recorded using child singers. "Alphabet Song""Ants Go Marching""Bingo""The Chicken Dance""The Hamster Dance Song""Happy Birthday To You""If You're Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands""I've Been Working On The Railroad""Old MacDonald Had a Farm""Pop Goes The Weasel""Wheels On The Bus Go Round and Round""When The Saints Go Marching In"Ace of Base - "Beautiful Life"Baha Men - "Who Let The Dogs Out?"The Beach Boys - "Surfin' U.S.A."Buster Poindexter - "Hot, Hot, Hot"Carl Douglas - "Kung Fu Fighting"C+C Music Factory feat.
