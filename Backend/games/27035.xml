Giant      mutant camels are advancing towards you planetary base and you have to destroy them via your little     spaceship. The game is essentially a    side-scrolling shooter with the one exception that the game screen advancement is not tied to your   spaceship, but the slow, steady and deadly advance of the giant camel(s). As you shoot the camels, they change colour, which indicateds their  damage status.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22407">Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</game><game id="16704">Revenge of the Mutant Camels</game><game id="30537">Desert Hawk</game><game id="10502">Batalyx</game><game id="5666">Falcon Patrol</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366007-a5200_attackofthemutantcamels.jpg</image></root>
