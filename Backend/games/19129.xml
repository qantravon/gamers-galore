It runs on the same DreamForge engine that SSI used for Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession and Menzoberranzan. Combat takes place in real time.PlotThe game begins with two player-created characters sent to investigate a magical barrier, beyond which is a desert. What follows takes place in an Egyptian-inspired setting, rather than the Gothic horror motif that is more commonly associated with the Ravenloft campaign setting.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11234">Eye of the Beholder</game><game id="1500">Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon</game><game id="14326">Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor</game><game id="12165">Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62404/1391077-stoneproph.jpg</image></root>
