The game features new mechanics such as the air moves performed using the R shoulder button and D-pad. It also includes many improvements and changes to make the game feel much faster; the characters start off running on each level, they can reach a much higher top speed and also have much faster acceleration. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9441">Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!</game><game id="21622">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Veediots!</game><game id="1683">Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday</game><game id="20748">Super Mario Bros. 3: Super Mario Advance 4</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2098012-box_sonica2.png</image></root>
