The gameplay can be described as a mix of strategy and tactical roleplaying. It employs a hex based combat system like the        Heroes of Might  Magic franchise, albeit on a much smaller scale with only four party members with individual talents and stats.    Currently, only the first chapter of the game, entitled "The Deep Roads", is available.  However, EA 2D announced ongoing efforts to create a second chapter entitled "The Darkness Within" as well as an unnamed third chapter.Dragon Age: Origins Unlocks Players can log into Journeys using their     EA Online accounts and unlock specific items in Origins.
