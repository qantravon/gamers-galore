<root><id>31014</id><name>Podd</name><description>Podd is a relatively simple   educational game created to help youngsters expand their vocabulary and improve spelling, released on the  BBC Micro. It was designed by Don Walton for Acornsoft in 1984. The game consists of a single text field that the player must fill in to complete the sentence "Podd can..." Words entered usually take the form of verbs. Players then watch the resulting actions as Podd acts out the word entered in the form of a short animation.Podd's SecretThe premise of the game was for players to find all the words that Podd knew as can be seen from the game box text: Podd  has a secret. When you find out, don't tell anyone. Podd  can  do lots of things  that you can do but this adorable character can  also  perform many unusual  actions. Podd actually knows 120 words but  isn't  going to tell you what they  are. You have to find them. You'll   probably have to think very hard about the  action words that you use.   You may want to ask your friends or even use a  dictionary for some   ideas. Podd will  fascinate you, frustrate you, charm you, make you  laugh  and give hours of fun. Make  a friend. Play with  Podd! Ages 5-11  While the game box states that Podd's vocabulary consists of 120 words  in reality this was much smaller as many of the animations were duplicated.  What can Podd do?  Below is a short list of words that Podd can act out: Walk, jog, run, hike and strollJumpHopWhistle Sing, talkWinkSneezeDanceExplode, pop, burst</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/89385/1349820-podd.png</image></root>
