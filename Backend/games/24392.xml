The game, released only in      Japan, is a minigame collection of sorts spanning the entire     Evangelion storyline. Scenes from the anime are reenacted using both the game's engine and motion .gif-style video sequences.GameplayThe actual gameplay consists of both fighting sequences (using 2-D gameplay with 3-D graphics, a la   Battle Fantasia and  Street Fighter IV), and minigames based around different action sequences from the television show.A training mode is also available, but does not actually train the player to play the game. Instead, the mode is a shooting gallery simulating the training the characters went through during the television show. The game allows players to select any pilot from the show as a playable character in this mode.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28105">Evangelion: Jo</game><game id="23662">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/429/794735-evan64.jpg</image></root>
