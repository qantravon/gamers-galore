One addition is the concept of party members who just behave like items.StoryPicking up directly after episode 4, Strong Bad finds himself with a rampaging Trogdor arcade machine with a broken logic matrix. However, Trogdor, relaxing at home. while trying to fix it, he accidentally merges the world of Free Country, USA with the world of video games. The only way to make things right is to kill his own creation, and to do so Strong Bad must travel through his 8-bit ghost-infested home, as well as the video-game worlds of Peasantry (of Peasant's Quest), the year 20X6 (of Stinkoman 20X6) and the inside of his Gel-Arshie Pro Fruit-Boarder cartridge- to which Strong Bad says "Remember kids, licensed games are always terrible." It ends with an epic battle with Trogdor at the top of Castle Poopenstein 3D.   PC Requirements Operating System: Microsoft® Windows® XP/Vista/Windows 7Processor: 2.0 Ghz or better (3 GHz Pentium® 4 or equivalent recommended)Memory: 512 MB RAM (1GB recommended)Hard Disk Space: 310 MBVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX® 8.1 compliant video card (128 MB recommended)Sound Card: DirectX® 8.1 sound deviceDirectX® Version: DirectX® Version 9.0c or better (DirectX updater included)Controller Support: Yes    No internet connection required to play         </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4938/811713-logo.png</image></root>
