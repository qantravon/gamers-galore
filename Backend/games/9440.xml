Points are scored by shooting down the pins with bowling balls. Hazards such as bottles or trophies must be avoided, as this will cost the player a life. Also on the screen are X and /. Collecting these will add them to scorecard on the bottom of the screen. Filling all 10 frames of the scorecard will advance the level.</description><genres><genre id="29">Bowling</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/37494/1730106-alley_oops_title_screen.png</image></root>
