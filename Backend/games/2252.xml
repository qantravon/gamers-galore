<root><id>2252</id><name>Microsoft Flight Simulator (v4.0)</name><description>The fourth version of Microsoft Flight Simulator was released shortly after version 3 introduced new features like AI controlled air traffic and a few ground vehicles on the larger airports, dynamic weather and an sailplane (with a couple of sailplane specific scenarios that started with it already in the air, as it couldn't lift off the ground on the default runways). It was the last version in the series to include the World War 1 combat mission mode, in which you piloted the Sopwith Camel and had to shoot down German airplanes and bomb their airports.It also included the experimental aircraft designer, in which you could build experimental planes by modifying the values for wingspan, scale and propulsion for the included airplane models and test fly them.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/113103/1678254-989033262_00.jpg</image></root>
