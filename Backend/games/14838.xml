The goal is to shut down the nuclear reactors in each level to reduce the chance of further catastrophe. Each of the seven stages is filled with boss and mini-boss fights, with scarce ammo pods that the player is allowed to assign to specific weapons. The protagonist is able to shoot in multiple directions and is given extra mobility from his jet-pack.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
