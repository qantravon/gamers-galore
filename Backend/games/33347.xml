<root><id>33347</id><name>UBeat</name><description> Location Test UBeat was originally tested alongside DanceDanceRevolution X at Irvine Boomers in Septermber 2008. This was a surprise to fans of Konami's Bemani franchise, as it was brand new to Japan and the last several US location tests for Bemani titles (IIDX, GFdm) had been fruitless. The test lasted for about a week and garnered a ton of attention from new players and bemani fanatics alike, many of which went back every day to get their fix of the title fully expecting it to not see a release in the US.  Shortly after the test at Boomers ended, the machines made their way to UK for a trade show and short location test in London. Seeing basically the same response overseas, the decisions still was made for the title to be scrapped due to high production costs and low adoption possibilities. THe machines made their way back to California one last time for a slightly longer test at Sherman Oaks Castle Park. The 2nd test was meant solely for the general public and received no real publicity from Konami. While UBeat ultimately wasn't released, Konami felt it did well enough in the testing phase to go back to the drawing board a bit and do a limited location test for Jukebeat a year later.Songlist A-Ha - Take On Me Darude - Sandstorm*Cover* - Barbie GirlSnow - InformerMichael Fortunati - Give Me Up*Cover* - Venus*Cover* - Set You FreeScatman John - Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)The VIllage People - Y.M.C.A.Kozo Nakamura - Jumping BoogieMutsuhiko Izumi - Orpheus In The UnderworldMutsuhiko Izumi - Snow GooseMutsuhiko Izumi - Polaris*Cover* - I'm In The Mood For DancingChris Brown feat.
