<root><id>32988</id><name>Super Off Road</name><description>OverviewSuper Off Road is the console adaptation of the Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road Arcade racer. These versions lack the Ironman license, but the gameplay is all but identical. The player, along with either another human player or up to three AI opponents, race around a single-screen track in a format similar to Atari's Super Sprint. The player can upgrade their car's stats with the money earned after each race, or purchase more Nitro for one-off speed boosts.Different versions have different features. The SNES version has twice as many tracks as the original Arcade game (sixteen rather than eight), and the NES version allows up to four players to play with the NES Satellite or Four Score peripherals.Critical ReceptionWhen the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,4,5 adding, "...after a while it does get tough on the eyes and I found I could not play for very long. The truck controlled well and was faithful to the arcade game, but just too small.".</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19111">Super R.C.
