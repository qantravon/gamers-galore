It is an upgraded port of the 2010 GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo Wii, which is a re-imagining of the 1997 Nintendo 64 Rareware classic of the same name (as well as a looser re-imagining of the 1995 movie GoldenEye).The graphics have been improved with smoother textures, better particle effects, and an increased framerate. The game also has revamped controls similar to those found in the Call of Duty franchise, just as it did with the Classic or Gamecube controllers on the Wii. The PS3 version also comes with Move support.The game will also feature and expanded multiplayer with up to 16 players online (the Wii version had an 8-player limit), and a 4-player split screen. The game will also feature an all new "MI6 Ops Missions" mode where players will complete different challenges, such as pirating computer software. Each challenge can be modified via a wide array of options, such as AI and overall difficulty. Once the player has completed a challenge with his custom set of options, he can challenge other players online with those settings.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32956">GoldenEye: Source</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1982776-box_ge007r.png</image></root>
