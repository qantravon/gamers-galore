The gameplay of Drakan is a mix of on-foot combat and exploration in dungeons and aerial combat atop Rynn's dragon. The game world is made up of multiple dungeons which are all connected to an overworld where Rynn could either travel on foot or choose to fly around on Arokh. Killing enemies and completing quests would reward the player with items that could be equipped on Rynn in traditional Action-RPG style. Interestingly, no skill or statistical requirements were ever required to equip any type of weapon.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13641/2412764-3027.jpg</image></root>
