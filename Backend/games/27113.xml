An updated port of the game was made for North America on both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 (via PSN). The game is also set to be released for PC via Steam on October 3, 2013.StoryThe story follows Leonhardt, a man of noble birth with the misfortune of being the last member of a disgraced house. Leonhardt turns his back on the war and his country to save an elven girl and in doing so he is mortally wounded by the Dark Knight, he then swears that he and all his descendants will be a spirit vessel for a mysterious woman called Dyshana, if she will grant him power so he can protect the elven girl.GameplayFighting plays out like a strategic RPG where each character can perform various moves, characters can perform collaborative attacks if they are in the extended area of another character and as the battle progresses the player builds up SP which can be used to pull off 'extra skills' which allow you to deal large amounts of damage. When the game progresses, you will be able to adjust the field of battle prior to beginning the fight.The game includes dating sim elements through its "Soul Breed" system. As the player progresses through the game they can pursue one of three heroines. At the end of the generation, you will be able to pick one of heroines if their affection level is high enough. You will then have a child with the chosen character, the appearance, stats and abilities will vary depending on which heroine chosen. There are over 1000 combinations for the child's stats and abilities. You will then take control of the fully grown version of your child and continue the story. This happens four times in the game, totaling five generations of characters.There is also a moral choice system that influences the story.Limited EditionNaughty Limited Edition.The 360 exclusive "Really Naughty Limited Edition" includes:Yearning Ellis pillowcase (pillow not included)Sensual Vira-Lorr mouse padRecord of Agarest War SoundtrackNaughty Collectors Box to protect your girls$59.99 USDDownloadable ContentRecently the Xbox 360 has added DLC including these packs.
