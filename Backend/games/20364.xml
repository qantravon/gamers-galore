<root><id>20364</id><name>Zero Wing</name><description>Zero Wing is incredibly infamous for the opening sequence of the game in the English version for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The dialogue has been remixed several times and has even been sung about by Nirvana. The line: "All Your Base Are Belong to Us" has been used many times in pop culture and parodies.Williams licensed the arcade version for distribution in the US, but the console versions of the game were never released in that territory. The infamous English translation comes from the European Mega Drive version of Zero Wing.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="16642">U.N.
