Its is more like a submarine sim then a traditional arcade game.PlotSilent Service is set in the Pacific Ocean during World War Two. The player assumes control of a U.S. Submarine, the U.S.S. Raven, which is assigned missions to carry out. This side of the war is rarely told in games. There are two types of game modes to play; Convoy Actions and War Patrol. Convoy Actions are specific scenarios in which the player is given a specific objective to complete. In War Patrol mode players are given the ability to roam anywhere in the Pacific  for 30 days looking for Japanese ships to attack. GameplayThis game is basically a submarine simulation game. It uses realistic tactics such as the End Around, as well as having the ability to adjust visibility and dud torpedoes. The game also gives you control of the rudders, periscope, and ballast, as well as displaying the speed, depth, and heading of your sub. You are placed in the waters of Japan and you are required to ping ships with your sonar in order to detect enemies. This game has a relatively steep learning curve to it.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2772">GATO</game><game id="19965">Das Boot: German U-Boat Simulation</game><game id="3299">Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/236442-silent_service.jpg</image></root>
