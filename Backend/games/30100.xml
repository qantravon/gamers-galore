The player takes control of a star named Aura-Aura, which is trying to climb back to the sky after crashing to the ground. The game consists of a 10 level campaign/Score Attack mode, an Endless mode, and a Marathon mode.GameplayThe player navigates from peg to peg in the environment using an extendable grapple arm, controlled by the D-pad. The player must avoid enemies and electric traps while triggering switches and using boost-pegs to climb to the top in as short a time as possible. The player can jump only a very small distance from a peg, but the grapple arm can be lengthened using power-ups in the environment; enemies can be cleared from the screen using collected bombs.In Score Attack mode, the player is ranked based on completion time, number of gems collected, as well as longest uninterrupted climb (not hitting the same peg twice). In Endless mode, the player collects time, extending how long the player has to keep climbing.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1282670-aura_aura_climber.jpg</image></root>
