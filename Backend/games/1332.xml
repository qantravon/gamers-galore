<root><id>1332</id><name>Faces</name><description>OverviewFaces carries the subtitle "...Tris III" because it is considered the third in the Tetris series following the original Tetris and Welltris. The game was originally conceived by Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov and Vladimir Pokhilko.The goal of the game is to stack falling blocks in order, with each block bearing a part of a person's face: the chin, mouth, nose, eyes, or forehead. Each level features several different people's faces; creating a "perfect" face from the parts of a single person will clear the face and all blocks in the column underneath. Creating a mixed face will clear only the face itself and one block underneath. Each level uses a selection of personalities including historical figures, artists, scientists, and monsters. Levels at higher difficulties include a larger number of different personalities.Faces featured a multiplayer mode with competitive two player head-to-head play. Another interesting feature was the ability to load your own graphics into the game, replacing the default faces with your family members, dog, or whatever other images you liked.TriviaIn a twist on the concept of the Incorrect Usage of Cyrillic Letters, Faces uses a hammer and sickle symbol as the the letter 'C' in its title.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1720899-564825_29710_front.jpg</image></root>
