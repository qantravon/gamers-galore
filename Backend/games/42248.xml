Using actor templates and static backgrounds, any user from a child as young as 5 can make semi-professional looking animations. Characters range from a duck to a bird, and a pig to a baseball. Your own imagination is this games boundary. By discovering new techniques you can make some pretty impressive looking toons. This is where the fun lies.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14041-1.jpg</image></root>
