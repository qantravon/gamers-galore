You could chose the number of players (games were always red versus blue)Â on the pitch eventhough it wasn't possible to have a proper 11 vs 11 match. You pressed the action button to shoot or pass and the stick to move around.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
