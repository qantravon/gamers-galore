You start bargaining with common goods, build up your own production and establish a merchant fleet. Later on, you will gain more and more political influence and even found new towns. However, a Hanse merchant's life can also have its dark sides. On your way to power you have to hold your ground against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with economic competition, price wars or impure means such as sabotage.   The player will compete against other CPU controlled Merchants to create wealth by trading goods, building houses and workshops within towns, and hiring pirate captains.System RequirementsMinimum:   OS: Windows XP/ Windows Vista / Windows 7Processor: Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.0 GHz / AMD Athlon XP 2000+Memory: 1 GB of RAMHard Disk Space: 3.1 GBVideo Card: 256 MB nVidia GeForce 6800 / ATI Radeon X1650Sound Card: DirectX CompatibleDirectX: 9.0cKeyboard / MouseMedia: DVD Rom DriveRecommended: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 @ 3.0 GHz / AMD Athlon 64 3500+ (or better)Memory: 2 GB of RAMVideo Card: 512 MB nVidia GeForce 8800 / ATI Radeon HD 3870 (or better)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28310">The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom</game><game id="30057">Sid Meier's Civilization V</game><game id="23459">Dawn of Discovery</game><game id="43340">Rise of Venice</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/22486/1514315-ptr.jpg</image></root>
