The game is a       2D  side-scroller that allows two people      cooperative gameplay. The game is your run of the mill side-scroller with everyone's favorite two animated idiots at the helm. The game offers the basic shambling enemies and environmental hazards.The game also offers a few special moves such as Stimpy's ability to hurl Ren which can be useful when attempting traverse pitfalls and the lot.
