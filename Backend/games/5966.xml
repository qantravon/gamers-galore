It specifically draws its story, character and mecha from the Mobile Suit Z (or Zeta) Gundam TV series, which was a sequel to the original Mobile Suit Gundam.The game is split into two modes: The first is a first-person space sim in which the player fights other mobile suits as they travel over the surface of the Earth before breaking off into space and towards the enemy's orbital headquarters. After reaching the enemy base, the game moves to its second mode: A third-person, side-scrolling variant on Square's Thexder in which the player's jet/robot transforming mech Gundam must navigate a maze of tunnels to reach the core of the base and blow it up. The modes then repeat for the next stage.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="36497">Star Cruiser</game><game id="14476">Thexder</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1498429-msgzhotscramble_front.jpg</image></root>
