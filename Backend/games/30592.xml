<root><id>30592</id><name>Targ</name><description>Targ takes place in the futuristic place called "Crystal City" or in other words blue square with 81 yellow squares (9x9 grid).   The player plays as a "Wummel"  that looks like a little green car that drives around the grid shooting the red  triangular "Targs." Occasionally the "Spectar Smuggler" appears and shooting it  is worth extra points. The game is over when the player dies by the Targs or  defeats all the Targs on the board. If the player takes too long the Targs  increase in speed until the game ends and the next round starts.  The  game sales were good enough to spawn a sequel named     Spectar. </description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/80045/1322079-targ_1.jpg</image></root>
