The big twist in the game is involving pressure points. The player can only kill the main enemies by finding and talking to the villagers to find out information about the enemies. If the knowledge is not known, the enemy cannot be defeated.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2383227-hokuto_no_ken.jpg</image></root>
