<root><id>8437</id><name>TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</name><description>A game seen by many as the greatest Touring Car game around in the Playstation era, this game focuses on the British Touring Car Championship.Featuring many new additions at the time, the game includes:Championship mode - meet challenges in the sprint and endurance race (normally 6 laps but you must make 1 pit stop). For the first time this also allowed players to have multiplayer championship races making it a more tactical affair for whether you pit now or let your team mate stop first and then go in the next lap.Single Race - race on conditions set by you.Multiplayer - Split screen racing with your friends around great tracks featuring the real cars used in the BTCC. Also a co-operative championship mode where 2 players could take part in the same championship as team mates.Drivers like Plato, Tarquini, and many other famous names from the BTCC feature in this. Also, the game has other cars for single race events like the formula 3000 cars and other secret unlocks.This game is a predecessor of the Race Driver and GRID series by Codemasters.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9010">Formula 1 Championship Edition</game><game id="2416">Gran Turismo</game><game id="8779">Sega GT 2002</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="17784">Gran Turismo 4</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="8100">Gran Turismo 2</game><game id="21297">Gran Turismo HD</game><game id="7482">Gran Turismo Concept: 2001 Tokyo</game><game id="21390">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Seoul</game><game id="7313">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Geneva</game><game id="13895">Gran Turismo 4: Prologue</game><game id="9927">SRS: Street Racing Syndicate</game><game id="14428">Sega GT Online</game><game id="15965">Sega GT</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="6903">Overspeed: High Performance Street Racing</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="17599">Forza Motorsport</game><game id="12976">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="20741">Need for Speed: Undercover</game><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="9651">Need for Speed Underground 2</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="8831">Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</game><game id="12395">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</game><game id="453">Need for Speed: High Stakes</game><game id="18021">Need for Speed: Carbon - Own the City</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="6499">RalliSport Challenge 2</game><game id="1101">Ridge Racer 7</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="357">Burnout 3: Takedown</game><game id="16492">Burnout Revenge</game><game id="4970">Burnout Legends</game><game id="13514">Burnout 2: Point of Impact</game><game id="8459">Burnout Dominator</game><game id="20484">Burnout</game><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="32037">STCC - The Game</game><game id="37743">F1 2012</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/329/1441462-toca2_f.jpg</image></root>
