Take No Prisoners set the standard for the new type of top down view gameplay that used 2D sprites in a 3D environment. Another novelty that was not as common back in the day as it is now was the ability to drive vehicles found in the game world. Take No Prisoners had 30 levels and over 20 different weapons to be used as well as various multiplayer modes.PC System RequirementsWindows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista600 mhz245 MB RAM</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7382">Loaded</game><game id="2893">Re-Loaded</game><game id="39452">Hotline Miami</game><game id="13619">Mageslayer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82561/1299645-take_no_prisoners_jewel_case_cover.jpg</image></root>
