During these sequences, should you fail to evade capture, you will take part in a joke-based mini-game. During these sequences, Valiant would be responsible for finding the correct punchline to a joke that Roger has started (eg. "Where is Timbucktoo?" - "Between Timbuck One and Timbuck Three").During the latter portions of the game, the player will be allowed to enter Toon Town, where they can continue tracking down clues to clear Roger's name, and prepare for the final showdown with Judge Doom.Game Boy VersionThe Game Boy version was developed independently by Capcom, and was a completely different game, and much more polished, casting the player as Roger Rabbit himself in what can only be called an open world adventure game. Players were tasked with hunting down items, interrogating characters, simple combat and otherwise doing wild things to get Roger out of trouble. The game featured fairly well drawn full-screen cutscenes.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5523">Dick Tracy</game><game id="11874">Ghostbusters</game><game id="16460">Tiny Toon Adventures</game><game id="22205">The Lone Ranger</game><game id="13771">Back to the Future Part II &amp; III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362605-nes_whoframedrogerrabbit.jpg</image></root>
