<root><id>7817</id><name>Fantasy World Dizzy</name><description>Overview  Like all the core Dizzy games, the character is able to move and jump  through a world full of dangers and puzzles to solve. The underlying  concept of Fantasy World Dizzy is that all of Dizzy's friends (the  Yolkfolk) have been magically ensorcelled with various fairy-tale curses  and Dizzy must rescue them all.    The game is non-linear, allowing the player to travel in any direction  they wish. However, certain obstacles will restrict movement around the  map until they are dealt with. This can be done by collecting items  (Dizzy has inventory space for three) and applying them where necessary  to solve puzzles and facilitate progress. Eventually, Dizzy must find  all his friends, use items to rescue them from their various enchanted  plights and then finally locate his girlfriend Daisy. For the best  ending, Dizzy must also have collected 30 gold coins scattered  throughout the game, usually in hard to reach or well-hidden places.    Fantasy World DIzzy is notable for being one of   Yahtzee's  favorite games, his love of which is often alluded to in his Zero  Punctuation reviews.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12806">The Humans: Meet the Ancestors</game><game id="22468">Slightly Magic</game><game id="18541">Jill of the Jungle</game><game id="4134">Norse by Norse West: The Return of the Lost Vikings</game><game id="8560">Wibble World Giddy: Wibble Mania!</game><game id="11258">Giddy II: Hero in an Egg Shell</game><game id="19721">Black Lamp</game><game id="42409">Spud's Quest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/826/612061-dizzy3.jpg</image></root>
