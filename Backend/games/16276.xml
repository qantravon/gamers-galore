<root><id>16276</id><name>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</name><description>Bold Moves is the name given to the US version of Ford Street Racing. This is the sequel to Ford Racing 3, and features 18 licensed Ford cars. Unlike previous versions of Ford Racing, this version of the game has you leading a racing team. At the start of the game, you are given a small amount of money, and are asked to select whether to buy a Focus SVT or a Fiesta RS. Once you have selected a car, you must race other drivers. You can command your team to push up, and also to just keep an even pace.Â The European version of the game was incompatible with some Playstation 2 models, as it was produced on blue CDs. SCPH-300003 and 500003 models could not run this game, although older models could. This was a problem with almost all games produced by Xplosiv.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12341">ATV Quad Frenzy</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="7019">Ridge Racer V</game><game id="20597">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="8100">Gran Turismo 2</game><game id="21297">Gran Turismo HD</game><game id="7482">Gran Turismo Concept: 2001 Tokyo</game><game id="21390">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Seoul</game><game id="7313">Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Geneva</game><game id="13895">Gran Turismo 4: Prologue</game><game id="941">Project Gotham Racing</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="17599">Forza Motorsport</game><game id="8779">Sega GT 2002</game><game id="14428">Sega GT Online</game><game id="15965">Sega GT</game><game id="531">TOCA Race Driver 2</game><game id="5869">TOCA Touring Car Championship</game><game id="13734">TOCA Race Driver 3</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="1101">Ridge Racer 7</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="12976">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</game><game id="18095">Need for Speed: ProStreet</game><game id="8844">Need for Speed: Carbon</game><game id="20741">Need for Speed: Undercover</game><game id="9651">Need for Speed Underground 2</game><game id="12254">Need for Speed Underground</game><game id="5977">Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</game><game id="8831">Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</game><game id="12395">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</game><game id="453">Need for Speed: High Stakes</game><game id="18021">Need for Speed: Carbon - Own the City</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="6499">RalliSport Challenge 2</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="357">Burnout 3: Takedown</game><game id="16492">Burnout Revenge</game><game id="4970">Burnout Legends</game><game id="13514">Burnout 2: Point of Impact</game><game id="8459">Burnout Dominator</game><game id="10149">Burnout: Championship Drag Racing</game><game id="24995">Forza Motorsport 3</game><game id="8621">Hummer: Badlands</game><game id="19707">Ford Vs.
