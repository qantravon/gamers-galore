<root><id>6303</id><name>Interphase</name><description>Based at least in spirit on William Gibson's cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, Interphase is a first-person action game where the player enters a computer system, locates and disables various locks and security protocols which in turn permits the progress of a real-life infiltrator outside the computer world.Each mission starts with the player entering the computer system as a ship flying through a tube filled with horizontal and vertical lasers. After passing all the lasers and entering the system, the player must navigate to where crucial parts to the system must be closed down, while also eliminating the computer's inherent security systems - represented as spaceships that can shoot at the player. The system is also full of various programs, which have 3D representations which resemble basic 3D polygons and bacteriophages as well as more identifiable shapes. These programs may be vital to the player's mission or can simply be ignored.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/654341-interbac.jpg</image></root>
