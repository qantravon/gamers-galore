As a deadly alien race, the Charva, invades Earth's farthest colonies, they are sent from the Mothership to stop the invasion before it spreads inwardly and reaches the Sol system. Controlling them from a top-down style view reminiscent of the 80's classic Ikari Warriors, you must lead this soldier in battle in 14 levels, each one with its boss, and annihilate everything with 10 tools of mass destruction: your annihilation will be shown by a spectacular 3D engine offering gigantic explosions and light effect with bump mapping support.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/15136-1.jpg</image></root>
