The graphics are 3D but the action is primarily on a 2D plane with the exception of the ability to sidestep.Some of the gameplay systems included are:Barrage Blow - A super attack that consumes one bar of meter.Super Cancel - As in Street Fighter EX it is possible to cancel supers into one another.Hard Reversal - An attack used to counter the opponent on wake-up, it is performed by pressing the same strength punch + kick whilst landing and consumes one bar of meter.Hard Attack - A universal guard-breaker similar to the one in the Street Fighter EX games. It can be performed by pressing two attack buttons of the same strength together.Blow Quit - If timed correctly a normal attack from you and the opponent can clash and cancel each other out.Easy Combination - If a light punch connects and you keep pressing the button your character will perform a short chain combination.The game also features a rather unique arcade mode. There are multiple routes the player can take depending on how the player performs in a bonus fight against a knight. These routes determine which bonus boss the player will face, the most absurd of which being the famed shark.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20734">Street Fighter EX</game><game id="20735">Street Fighter EX Plus</game><game id="12518">Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1116287-fightinglayer.jpg</image></root>
