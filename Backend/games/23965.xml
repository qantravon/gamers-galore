Developed by Next Level Games, the Wii title retains the hallmark gameplay of the NES version with a variety of tweaks and improvements. To make it to the top, Little Mac will need to face off against all of his opponents from the NES game save Mike Tyson and Mr. Dream, along with a few faces from Super Punch-Out!!.GameplayPunch-Out!! Is essentially an enhanced remake of the games Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!!, two of Nintendo's most popular games of old. The game draws most from the original NES title, which is perhaps the most popular boxing game to date. The player puts on the gloves of Little Mac, a boxer aspiring to become the W.V.B.A. champion. He must ascent each W.V.B.A. circuit, taking out more talented boxers as he ranks up. Mac possesses a relatively limited repertoire of moves. He can throw left and right body blows, as well as left and right jabs.Great Tiger's specialHis defensive capabilities amount to dodges, ducking, and blocking. When blocking, Mac will take a slight amount of chip damage, and lose a single heart. Mac will lose three hearts when he is hit, having failed to block or dodge. When Mac's hearts are depleted, he'll become exhausted, being slow to react and unable to fight. Hearts are regained by dodging attacks. Mac also has a star punch, which is a very powerful uppercut. Mac earns stars through good performance, and loses them whenever he gets hit. The stars are used for the star Punch, his most powerful attack, a charging uppercut with devastating power. Only three stars can be held at a time.Each character has a life meter, representing how much stamina they have left. Their stamina will drain as they take punches from their opponent. Once it has been depleted, the character will be down for the count. If a character is knocked down three times in a round, they lose by Technical Knockout (TKO). If a character is knocked down and fails to get up during the count, they lose by Knockout. If both characters last three round, the victor is selected by decision. Usually, whomever has the most points and the most knockdowns will come out victorious. In single player mode, not all matches can be won by decision. The object of the game is, of course, to knockout your opponent and not get knocked out yourself.The many opponents Mac faces in Punch-Out come from all corners of the world, and possess a wide variety of attacks and special moves. The goal is to read opponents patterns, dodge their attacks, and punish them. Each character has a variety of tactics that they will mix into the fight, which Mac must memorize to succeed. Many fighters often give off cues as to when they are going to make a move, and the player can read these, and if they act quickly enough, can catch their opponent off guard to earn a star. Each character has a special attack that they will use to try and finish Mac off. These are often the most difficult attacks to counter. A large part of the game is discovering the weakness of every opponent you face. Not all characters will go down with a simple dodge and counter strategy. Fighters like King Hippo are almost a puzzle in the ring, as their weaknesses are not so obvious.This won't be good.The game goes into slow motion when a knockout occurs and characters show bruises and lumps when they are damaged. The game has a cartoony vibe with characters doing things like flexing muscles or belching in a cut scene before a mach. The game also displays twirly stars on the characters head to show that they are stunned or dizzy. There are also slapstick signature moves like growling, dropping shorts, clonking oneself on the head, twirling, etc. Whenever a character gets hit, they often bleed foods native to their home.Once the player has completed a circuit, they will unlock a title defense mode that pits them against previous opponents who have learned from their mistakes. King Hippo and Glass Joe will bring protection for their weapon points, and have all new patterns and tells.Control Options:Motion Control (Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers) - Punch-Out!! uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuk to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Press up and throw left and right punches for an uppercut. The Wii Balance board can also be utilized for an even more engrossing experience.Classic Control (Wii Remote NESâ„¢ style) - Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to play Punch-Out!! using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.Game ModesCareerThe referee originally appeared in the Punch-Out!! arcade game.Career Mode is the main single player experience.
