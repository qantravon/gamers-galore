It was developed by Page 44 Studios in San Francisco, and for the most part met with mediocre reviews. A follow up on the PSP, Gretzky NHL '06 was released only 5 months later in August.In Canada it was for many disappointingly added to the PSP Bundle at launch, which in turn also forced consumers to pay an extra $50 for their PSP, with no other purchase option.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="39">Hockey</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21784">Gretzky NHL 06</game><game id="21783">Gretzky NHL 2005</game><game id="6923">NHL 2005</game><game id="7693">ESPN NHL 2K5</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1837497-box_gretznhl.png</image></root>
