You control a fleet of ships you can send out to fight enemy ships or other bases. When combating a ship you try to get close while choosing what weapon you want of fire when you are close enough. You man hit or miss depending on which weapon you use. Then whoever depletes the energy bar first will be the winner. Whoever defeats the most ships wins in arcade mode although in Campaign mode you just have to complete whatever objective it gives you.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/2391125-bsgp19.png</image></root>
