<root><id>21268</id><name>The Hobbit</name><description>Overview  In The Hobbit, the player takes control of                           Bilbo Baggins and follows the homely                         hobbit on a grand adventure across Middle-Earth.                           Gandalf the Wizard selects Bilbo to help a party of thirteen                        dwarves rescue their treasure hall back from Smaug the Dragon; he will be their                       burglar. During the party's travels, Bilbo will find himself battling                      orcs,                     goblins,                    wolves, and                   spiders, as well as sneaking past                  trolls and collecting a lot of    side-quest items. As a character, Bilbo does not have an incredible amount of abilities. He can throw stones to knock down items and ward off foes, strike enemies with his walking stick and later the sword Sting, climb ropes and ladders, pick locks via a selection of                 minigames,                sneak to avoid detection, and use the               One Ring to turn invisible. Bilbo can also collect silver pennies which can be used to purchase helpful items from a vendor at the end of each level. There's a small RPG element in The Hobbit; Bilbo gains Courage Points experience for defeating monsters and completing side-quests, increasing his health.              Scrolls teach Bilbo abilities which he can use for battle and other situations throughout the game.   Chapter Levels   Dreamworld: Bilbo passes out when the thirteen dwarves visit and Gandalf informs him of his part in their plot.
