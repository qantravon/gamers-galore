<root><id>40380</id><name>Samurai Sword</name><description>OverviewSamurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.While the game initially has the guise of an RPG it is in actuality a traditional Famicom adventure game in the model of Portopia or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player has at their disposal a series of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10557">SpellCaster</game><game id="5516">Shadowgate</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="39840">Ripple Island</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2360071-samurai_sword_fds.jpg</image></root>
