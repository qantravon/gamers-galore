Version 6 follows the same line as the previous, but with modifications to the law there. Its interface was modified inical, my opinion is that the former was better, if you speak the same story content changes, and the New Skins will too. We added several other weapons with a very cool visual, since the guns until Machines Guns and not to mention the equipment, where HE's are shaped Pumpkin, Heart, Cookie, among others. Already rifles had two changes that I found the best one simulates a jogging stroller with a monkey riding. (This was Jewel) and other Rifle is a guitar where your shots emit musical notes. (Very well done). Summarizing. It is worthwhile to download Counter Strike Xtreme V6.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17575-1.jpg</image></root>
