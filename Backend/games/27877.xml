When playing against human opponents instead of the A.I, more gamemodes are playable.   In most of the gamemodes you have multiple choice answers. A timer counts down whenever a question is asked, rewarding you with more points for a fast answer. On the other hand, you'll loose more points if you get your answer wrong and fast.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15957">Sky Sports Football Quiz</game><game id="21117">Buzz!
