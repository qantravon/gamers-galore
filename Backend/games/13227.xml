Road Avenger was an FMV interactive movie, essentially played as an enormous Quick Time Event, with the player reacting to onscreen prompts to steer, accelerate, and brake his car. Very similar in gameplay to the likes of Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, and Time Gal.The game was originally released in 1985 as a laserdisc-based arcade game called Road Blaster, and was later ported to home systems as Road Avenger.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="463">Space Ace</game><game id="18245">Space Ace II: Borf's Revenge</game><game id="23">Dragon's Lair</game><game id="28104">Tengai Makyou: Karakuri Kakutoden</game><game id="2389">Revenge of the Ninja</game><game id="2021">Time Gal</game><game id="33468">Lupin Sansei</game><game id="32217">Dragon's Lair Trilogy</game><game id="18849">Cliff Hanger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8760/1202875-road_avenger.jpg</image></root>
