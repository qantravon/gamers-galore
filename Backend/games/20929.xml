It is the first Harvest Moon title to be developed exclusively for the Nintendo Wii console.Interestingly, Tree of Tranquility was originally listed as "Harvest Moon: Heroes" on many sites due to the listing "Harvest Moon / Heroes" that was featured on on the E3 press booklet. However this was just short for Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility and No More Heroes, two games that were displayed at the same time.StoryYou are headed for a small island with big dreams. When a storm hits the boat carrying you to your destination, trouble starts and you pass out. When you wake up, you find yourself in a doctor's office. However, while you were out you had a strange dream. As you ponder over the strange dream, the mayor shows up and introductions begin. A new adventure awaits!</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12893">Animal Crossing</game><game id="21631">Little King's Story</game><game id="2128">John Deere: American Farmer</game><game id="21096">Animal Crossing: City Folk</game><game id="23846">Harvest Moon: Animal Parade</game><game id="22930">Rune Factory: Frontier</game><game id="28041">Farming Simulator 2009</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2139799-box_hmtot.png</image></root>
