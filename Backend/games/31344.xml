<root><id>31344</id><name>Urban Brawl</name><description>Overview Urban Brawl (also known as Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl) is an           indie          first-person beat-em-up and shooter using a modified         id Tech 1 engine (known as ZDoom). The game was released in two forms: a        freeware download and a boxed CD (sold for $9.99 directly from the website, which includes bonus content). As of May 20, 2010, the boxed CD is no longer sold and the bonus content can be accessed from the main website. The game features a distinct comic-book style, with the story told in       noir-style cutscenes reminiscent to Sin City. The story, in which the protagonist is trying to rescue his daughter by a group of thugs, can be branched in multiple paths according to the player's actions. The game features multiple endings, both good and bad. The game also features plenty of secret items and weapons, such as     chainsaws and sub-machine guns.  The game can be found   here.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22011">Zeno Clash</game><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1379084-urbanbrawl_box.png</image></root>
