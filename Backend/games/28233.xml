In typical cave fashion, there are five stages all ending with a boss with several stages of attack. Progear features a distinct steampunk art-style, with characters and illustrations done by Junya Inoue.GameplayGeneralProgear in actionThe game is a bullet-hell shmup that requires the player to survive through five levels. The game functions on two buttons, A and B. Pressing and tapping the A button makes you go into "fighter mode" which causes your fighter plane be the main source of fire power and causes enemies to drop rings. Pressing and holding the A button switches you to "gunner mode" which lowers your fighter plane's mobility and fire power, but at the benefit of having your gunner lock on and have increased fire and aim at enemies making them drop stones. B releases a smart bomb from your initial stock of three that deal damage to enemies and that turns all enemy bullets into rings. The C button can also be enabled on the arcade test menu which trigger auto-fire mode; pressing and holding C button in this mode is the equivalent of tapping A button.Power UpsThere are three upgrades in this game: Power Up, Maximum Power, and Bomb Power UpPower UpUpgrades both the firepower of your fighter plane and gun flyer by one level. Your weapons can be upgraded for a total of four times. Maximum PowerMaximum PowerThis upgrades all of your firepower to the max. Maximum power only appears after you have lost all of your planes and have used a credit. BombBombGives you another smart bomb if you do not have three. If you get this power up if you have three bombs, you get three effects until your next plane.Jewel Counter is increased by 1000Base Jewel Class is increased for every extra bomb you collect (up to class 9)Inflicting enemy damage and level clear scores are doubledScore SystemThe score system revolves around collecting the stones and rings that come out of destroyed enemies, enemy parts, and enemy bullets. While all enemy bullets near exploding enemy units are turned into jewels, if the enemy is destroyed in gunner mode, all enemy bullets near enemy bullets that are going to turn into jewels are also converted. While possible to collect the jewels as they are free falling, the player can collect all the falling jewels on screen by switching between fighter and gunner modes.The types of jewels that can come out are dictated by the jewel class the player currently is in. A player can increase their jewel class by collecting a ring of the higher jewel class, which are found by converting a high amount of bullets simultaneously. Since this can be done only with rings, it is not possible to increase your jewel class in gunner mode. There a three ways you can decrease your jewel class. These three ways are: the use of a bomb, switching to fighter mode when there is a gem on screen or collecting a gem, and the loss of a life. Note that losing a life also comes at the cost of losing a quarter of your jewel score.At the end of each stage the player's performance is further measured via "gunner relationship". Thie is measured three ways. "Active" is the measure of the amount of stones and their value that was converted using gunner mode. "Safe" is the measure of the time not losing any planes. "Lovely" is the average of Active and Safe. A higher Lovely rating: increases how many points your smart bomb gives you, the difficulty of the next stage, and your ending.Jewel ClassRing ScoreGem ScoreJewel Level Small Amethyst10101 Medium Amethyst20102 Large Amethyst30103 Small Ruby40204 Medium Ruby50405 Large Ruby60806 Small Emerald701607 Medium Emerald803208Large Emerald 906409Diamond 100128010StoryThe story takes place in world where the industrial era is in full swing and several inventions have changed the course of history.
