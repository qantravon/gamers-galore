<root><id>861</id><name>Pac-Mania</name><description>Unlike regular Pac-Man, which is two dimensional, Pac-Mania has an isometric perspective, with the maze being larger than what is shown at any given time. The core game play is similar to original Pac-Man, with the goal being to eat dots, and eat ghosts after eating the power pellets. However, the main distinguishing feature is that in Pac-Mania, Pac-Man can jump to avoid ghosts. However, as the game progresses, the ghosts also attain the ability to jump, thus making them that much more dangerous.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21356">Pac Pack</game><game id="3269">Crystal Castles</game><game id="4559">K.C.
