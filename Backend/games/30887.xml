It also uses a cartoonish presentation most commonly associated with the first RBI Baseball game as well as many Japanese baseball sims for consoles.Though the original Japanese version of the game had no celebrity endorsement and was simply called Super Stadium, then-Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan attached his name to the American release. He can be seen on the box art and title screen, though his in-game avatar can only be identified by the surname "Ryan".Super Stadium has the distinction of being the second baseball game ever developed for the system (the first being Super Bases Loaded).</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5259">Super Baseball 2020</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2160036-nolan_ryan_s_baseball.jpg</image></root>
