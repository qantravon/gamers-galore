This includes: Jill of the Jungle, Jill of the Jungle: Jill Goes Underground, and Jill of the Jungle: Jill Saves the Prince. As the titles suggest, the player controls Jill, a jungle princess who spends her spare time collecting keys, transforming into different creatures,  and fighting demons. Each game in the series features new puzzles, enemies, environments, and outfit colors for the lovely protagonist. GameplayGameplay throughout the series remains relatively consistent, being largely made up of jumping, climbing, key-collecting, and dagger throwing. Throughout the game the player can collect up to 3 daggers or throwing stars to use as weapons along with apples scattered around the level to replenish health and earn additional points. Some levels require Jill to transform into various animals in order to progress, including a frog to jump high, a fish to allow her to breathe underwater, and a phoenix to allow her to fly.</description><genres><genre id="15">Compilation</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7634">Jazz Jackrabbit</game><game id="19460">The Adventures of Captain Comic</game><game id="12022">Superfrog</game><game id="1108">Vinyl Goddess from Mars</game><game id="14076">Shadow of the Beast II</game><game id="16864">Xargon</game><game id="29060">Dark Ages</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7001/261442-jjfile2_012.png</image></root>
