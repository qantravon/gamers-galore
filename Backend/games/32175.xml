<root><id>32175</id><name>Dungeon Keeper 3</name><description>OverviewAnnounced in February 2000, and cancelled shortly after in March 2000, Dungeon Keeper 3 would have had the player or "Dungeon Keeper" attempt to lay siege to the surface world of the heroes. A trailer for the game was included with Dungeon Keeper 2 that tells players "The time has cometh, a world of heroes awaits, a new beginning unfolds" while showing series mascot Horny rising to the surface.Reason for CancellationThe official statement by Bullfrog given at the time of cancellation was "A third episode of the Dungeon Keeper saga was underway, but opportunities to develop new intellectual properties on new platforms such as PlayStation 2 have meant that DK3 has been put on hold. There are currently no plans for another Dungeon Keeper game, however it remains an important franchise and there may be opportunities for us to pursue that direction in the future."</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17620">Dungeon Keeper</game><game id="19042">Dungeon Keeper: The Deeper Dungeons</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="1128">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary</game><game id="3642">The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Vikings</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="15960">Evil Genius</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="31820">Majesty 2: Pocket Kingdom</game><game id="39287">Impire</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93107/1449117-dungeon_keeper_3.jpg</image></root>
