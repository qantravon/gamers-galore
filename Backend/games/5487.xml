<root><id>5487</id><name>Columns</name><description>OverviewColumns is a Tetris-style puzzle game in which the player moves and changes the order of a stack of three falling jewels, which must be combined and arranged to connect three of the same type of jewel. The three jewels can be successfully connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game is over when the falling jewels have stacked all the way to the top of the screen. As time progresses, the speed at which the jewels fall increases, and the aim of the game is to last as long as possible to achieve the highest score. Columns also allowed players to compete against each other at the same time or against the computer in a Versus mode.This game came bundled with some Sega Genesis game systems.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2755">Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</game><game id="14873">Kirby's Avalanche</game><game id="21453">Big Kahuna Party</game><game id="21680">Trism</game><game id="16455">Klax</game><game id="1601">Lumines II</game><game id="23076">Sonic Eraser</game><game id="7395">Pok√©mon Trozei!</game><game id="2582">Wario's Woods</game><game id="3012">Pyramid</game><game id="12987">Mermaids of Atlantis: The Riddle of The Magic Bubble</game><game id="28182">Kubes</game><game id="29086">Unify</game><game id="30673">Tetris Battle Gaiden</game><game id="1824">Kunio no Oden</game><game id="12825">Vertrix2</game><game id="32734">Vertrix 3</game><game id="7647">Acid Drop</game><game id="14466">Triptych</game><game id="2282">Fructus</game><game id="36480">Hebereke's Popoon</game><game id="39217">Princess Maker Pocket Dai-sakusen</game><game id="3657">1993tris</game><game id="14169">Bejeweled</game><game id="42958">Clocks</game><game id="44410">The Jelly Bean Factory</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370464-genesis_columns.jpg</image></root>
