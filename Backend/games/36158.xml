Drawing a smile makes Mush happy, making him light and able to float. Drawing a sad face saddens Mush and makes him sink in water and weigh down objects. Shaking the phone angers Mush, allowing you to run faster and break obstacles.AwardsMush was nominated for the Ones to Watch Award at the 7th British Academy Video Games Awards (2011) after the developers competed in the Dare to be Digital competition.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9410">LocoRoco</game><game id="21111">LocoRoco 2</game><game id="22313">LocoRoco Cocoreccho</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2303982-box_mush.png</image></root>
