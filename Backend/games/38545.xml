The siblings play a prank on the old man by creating a rotten apple, and giving it to him to eat, which enrages the old man, who puts curses on both of them, and turns Lily partially to stone. Maxwell now must gather starites to help his sister return to normal.GameplaySimilarly to previous Scribblenauts games, much of the gameplay involves the player creating objects by entering words into Maxwell's notebook. Unlike previous games, which feature a linear progression through levels, in Scribblenauts: Unlimited, Maxwell is placed into an open world where he must interact with NPCs in order to fragments and starites which in turn open up new areas. Maxwell has a new ability, called star vision, which allows him to see which NPCs offer starites.PC Version DifferencesThe PC version has no multiplayer, but has a higher resolution, comes with Steam Workshop support, allowing for sharing of created characters and objects. 25 Steam achievements are also included.
