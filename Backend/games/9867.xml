Instead of a life-bar, you have a fitness-meter. This meter must be filled to a certain point marked by a broken heart, before each level is completed. Otherwise the level is restarted. To fill this meter, Penta has to collect diet soda. The meter goes down if Penta is hit by enemies or otherwise eats unhealthy food. There are six levels in the game. Three platforming levels, and three side-scrolling shooter stages. The goal is the same in all levels, to collect diet soda and fill the meter while avoiding enemies. The seventh level is the last boss, Genji, which is also a shooter level, but this time view from the rear.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/535386-yume_penguin_monogatari_box.jpg</image></root>
