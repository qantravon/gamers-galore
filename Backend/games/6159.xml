Though Nazca features heavily in the game (especially the famous Nazca Lines) the Western releases place the game far further North in Central America, in the ancient territory of the Aztecs.The game plays as a top-down perspective, as Niño races to beat three rival adventurers (which are controlled by the CPU) to the target. This involves crossing through deserts, jungles, marshes and ruins, destroying various enemies on the way with found weapons. The player can also hire computer-controlled helpers, by throwing money bags at certain enemies, who will assist them in their battles and increase the player character's projectile weapon strength.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5199">Illusion of Gaia</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/129083/1773885-aztec_adventure__front_.jpg</image></root>
