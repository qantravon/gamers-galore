You have a variety of weapons with which to do this and must fight off tanks, troops and planes.    You can use guided anti tank missiles, heat seeking air to air missiles, unguided rockets, machine guns or even place mines around the bases you are defending. There are also friendly troops that can help you out and they can be airlifted to the main base if injured to recover. The main base is also the only base which has an infinite supply of ammo and fuel so careful flying is required to make sure you don't leave yourself with no weapons to fight back with or even worse not enough fuel to make it back to base.    The landscapes themselves are fully contoured with defined hills and features. This was achieved by having the game only visible from four angles and the camera rotating by 90 degrees under the users control. Everything else however moved in any direction within the playing area.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1380574-combatlynx_23.jpg</image></root>
