Players are able to customize their fighter by choosing their appearance, as well as which techniques to include in the character's move set, with the majority of the techniques being accurate kickboxing, Muay Thai and Taekwon-Do moves. Players are also able to train a fighter, with practice sparring and pad drills increasing the speed and strength of the fighter.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14586">The Way of the Exploding Fist</game><game id="12530">Pit-Fighter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361168-nes_bestofthebestchampionshipkarate.jpg</image></root>
