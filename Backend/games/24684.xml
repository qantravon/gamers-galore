GameplaySam  Max Season 2 is a point-and-click adventure game. This simply means that all the controls you need is to click somewhere to interact with it. For example, clicking on someone starts a conversation with them, or clicking an object could either add it to your inventory, or just give a description of it. The inventory is represented by a cardboard box in the bottom left of the screen, which can be expanded to show the contents. You will have to use items that you pick up to help you get past scenarios and advanced in the plot. You mainly control Sam, however certain points in the game allow you to control Max.
