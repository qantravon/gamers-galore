You play as Rygar and your main weapon is a sharp disk on a chain that is whipped out. You get 3 different disk, the one you start out with, a blue disk that you can hit fast but no range and a sand color disk that slow with a wide range. The game is very God of War-like and the disk can be upgraded along with abilities.StoryDuring a ceremony for Rygar, Titans come and kidnap the Princess because the humans have had it too good for too long.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6959">God of War</game><game id="2136">Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams</game><game id="9088">Onimusha: Warlords</game><game id="12710">Onimusha 3: Demon Siege</game><game id="19861">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</game><game id="20553">Ninja Gaiden II</game><game id="18546">Ninja Gaiden Sigma</game><game id="6602">Ninja Gaiden Black</game><game id="21178">Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</game><game id="19467">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</game><game id="39749">Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2367523-box_rygar.png</image></root>
