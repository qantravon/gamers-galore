He was hit by a powerful sea storm while he was running away from the mighty kingdom that he was once bound to own. He survived and was washed ashore. There he found an ancient temple. The master of the temple trained him to become a ninja and named him "Kaeru". Kaeru also learned the way to break his evil curse. He must find the magic stone to break his curse and turn back into his handsome prince form again. The player must guide Kaeru through all the 48-levels by mouse control to collect the precious gem and avoid obstructions.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/152977/2137015-14748.jpg</image></root>
