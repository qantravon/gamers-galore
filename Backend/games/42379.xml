A beautiful uptown office remains unoccupied, despite its prime location. A downtown artist berates himself for selling out, while a Wall Street investor congratulates himself on a job well done.

Medium Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone are about to find out.</description><genres><genre>Adventure</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/16761-1.jpg</image></root>
