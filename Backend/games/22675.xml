You pilot the experimental RX-78 Gundam in the Universal Century 0079 - it's up to you to lead a colony of survivors to Jaburo and fend off the Zeon forces and Char Aznable, the Red Comet.  MSG:JtJ is all about the robots and Bandai does 'em right. Whether they're stomping around the battlefield or just chillin' back at the base, the Gundams look ready to jump off the screen and kick your cat's butt. What blows is that the rest of the game is a lacking in graphics. The backgrounds, buildings and terrain look ho-hum and are a bummer.  Thumbs Up: Cool robot suits.  Movie scenes from the original show.  Thumbs Down: Clunky controls. No multiplayer. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18060">Robot Alchemic Drive</game><game id="16367">Armored Core: Master of Arena</game><game id="15116">Armored Core 3</game><game id="20039">Armored Core 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2421675-box_msgjtj.png</image></root>
