However the title was eventually cancelled and was re-announced in 1995 as a title for Hudson's new console, the PC-FX. Namida was one of the most hotly anticipated titles for the system but in July 1997 the game was cancelled once again late into its development due to the PC-FX's poor sales and small user-base. Hudson and Red later completely reworked Namida and finally released the title in 2005 for the PS2.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23987">Nostalgia</game><game id="34771">PoPoLoCrois: Tsuki no Okite no Bouken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2111963-box.jpg</image></root>
