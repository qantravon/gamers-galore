Moai-kun can use his head(!) to break blocks and defeat enemies and on some stages you'll find bombs that you can pick up and use to destroy blocks that are beneath you.              Gameplay The objective of every stage is to rescue all the little guys that are standing around looking flustered before the timer runs out. You rescue them by running over to their location and touching them. When all of the guys have been rescued you can exit the stage by reaching the big iron door. Since the stages are designed with a single solution in mind (although with some room for improvisation) it can be quite easy to become stuck in a stage, leaving you with no other way out than to commit suicide by pressing the select button. Taking to the skies.  Controls A = Jump B = Headbutt  Down = Duck. This has no real practical use in the game.Down   B = Place Bomb Select = Commit suicide. This will restart the stage. Start = Pause the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4995">Bubble Bobble</game><game id="19781">Snow Bros.
