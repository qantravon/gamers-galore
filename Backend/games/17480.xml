Once the player fires, the screen shows the angle and the speed with which the cannonball is flying through the air.  The speed however is determined semi-randomly and as such, the angle has to be adjusted depending on the speed. Later stages in the game featured 'obstacles' which would force the player to shoot at specific angles, making it harder to hit the target. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5278/288289-cannonball.jpg</image></root>
