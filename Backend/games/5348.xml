Sears' "Tele-Games" variant of the VCS included Air-Sea Battle as a pack-in, renamed "Target Fun".Air-Sea Battle consists of six timed game modes, where players fire missiles at various targets. In every game mode, there are projectile and controllable-missile variants. Game ModesAnti-AircraftThe player controls the trajectory of missiles fired from a ground-based silo. Squadrons of aircraft must be shot down for points (which vary by level selected) to proceed to the next wave. In higher levels, blimps obstruct missiles, and are worth no points. TorpedoA variant where the silo is replaced with a moveable submarine. The trajectory arc cannot be adjusted in this mode, so the player must lie directly beneath the enemy for successful hits. Shooting GalleryThis mode combines the selectable firing arc of Anti-Aircraft, with the mobility of Torpedo. Additionally, targets are clowns, ducks, and rabbits, each with different point awards.PolarisA constantly moving boat's speed is controlled by the player. No selectable firing arc.BomberThis mode reverses the role of Torpedo. The player controls an aircraft which must bomb the submarine. The aircraft always moves, but the speed is player-controlled.Polaris v. BomberA multiplayer mode where one player controls a boat, and the other a plane. Each player tries to destroy the other within the time limit. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5368">Combat</game><game id="16433">Star Rangers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367667-a2600_airseabattlevcs.jpg</image></root>
