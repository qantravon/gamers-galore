On your way you'll encounter plenty of enemies from rival gangs to punch, kick and generally abuse. Just like in  River City Ransom you can buy special techniques and items from stores, however, in this game, as you kick enemies faces in your stats will grow simultaneously and you can choose which stats you want grown faster.  The other major difference to River City is that the game allows you to freely explore it in a non-linear fashion, albeit, this can get a bit confusing. Like most brawlers you can also have another player join in on your quest, but the added benefit here is that if you're flying solo the AI will take control of the extra character. You can also switch your partner around as you recruit new allies.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/529012-downtown_special_box.jpg</image></root>
