<root><id>7614</id><name>Hollywood Mogul</name><description> The game was designed and programmed by Carey DeVuono, who also published the game via the Hollywood Mogul website. The player helms a Hollywood production studio, must buy or conceive scripts and take care of every little detail concerned with the production, from the casting, budget, SFX, locations etc. Once the film is released, the player can see how the film performs all over the world and whether the movie is a hit, a flop or just breaking even.   The game comes with a database of actors and directors etc., but they are not based on real life persons. However, there is a very active community which has uploaded many databases and image packs onto the official website, to enhance your game experience. It is also possible to edit the database yourself. </description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3799">The Movies</game><game id="8462">The Movies: Stunts &amp; Effects</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
