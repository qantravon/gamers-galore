<root><id>42482</id><name>Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now</name><description>Like its predecessor, Carmageddon II was subject to criticism for the level of violence portrayed in the game. It is rated 15+ by ELSPA. In some countries, the pedestrians (and animals) are zombies, and blood is turned to green slime: In Germany, aliens replaced the pedestrians. Internet-released 'blood patches' restore the original human pedestrians. The blood pack was later released in the United Kingdom in 1999, earning the game an 18 certificate.
 
It features a heavy metal soundtrack with songs from Iron Maiden and instrumental tracks from Sentience.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17372-1.jpg</image></root>
