The castle consists of thirty levels that are randomly generated. Throughout the game you will be able to make use of different weapons, armor, potions, and magic canes. As you progress, you will need to find food for Trykaar to prevent starvation, but Fatal Labyrinth is unique in that he can also over eat and die. Also unique to Fatal Labyrinth is the use of gold. You can not spend any gold you find within the castle, but the more gold you have upon death, the more people will show up at your characters funeral (game over screen).</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1644">Eternal Quest</game><game id="22309">Rogue</game><game id="11418">Dragon Crystal</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370556-genesis_fatallabyrinth_eu.jpg</image></root>
