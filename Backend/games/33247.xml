If no other players can be found a CPU opponent will be added into the match. The game utilizes GGPO netcode which is important for two reasons. Number one being that it's the best possible netcode for fighting games thus far, and two being that this game marks the first time GGPO has been used in a commercial 3D fighting game.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33873/1679945-dragon_ball_zenkai_battle_royale.jpg</image></root>
