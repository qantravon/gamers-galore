The original  Qlione uses a lives system and has you dropping explosive or vacuum bombs to create waves that crush enemies.  Qlione 2 has an evolution system similiar to  flOw that lets you upgrade to different forms each with a unique attack. You devolve as you take damage, and getting hit while in the basic form is a game over.</description><genres><genre id="31">Dual-Joystick Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11099">Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</game><game id="15849">flOw</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/2325868-qlione_large.png</image></root>
