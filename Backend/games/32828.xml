Ten themed stages would present players with twenty different "courses" to race on; power-ups were included as well. Strategic sections of each course would magnify a power-up's strength. A Race Mode formed the basis of the game but a King of the Hill battle mode was also included where players would defend a peak position as long as possible.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/72276/1542610-008_sc_cube_shrink2_gba.jpg</image></root>
