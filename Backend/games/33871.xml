The concept behind the "Ultraman Club" was to consolidate all the different variants of Ultraman from his many appearances in the different shows and have the player control a party of them.Unlike the two prior games, which were more action-oriented, this gmae is a turn-based RPG similar to Final Fantasy. Players could also select each scenario from the title screen, choosing to play them in whichever order they wished - this type of freeform non-linear RPG model would appear later in Dragon Quest IV, though of course it had been common practice in Capcom's Mega Man series long before Ultraman Club's release.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="42804">Cyber Cross</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/122201/1683295-2641_1_expand.jpg</image></root>
