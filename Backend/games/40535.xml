Murder Case!") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.This game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="40512">Sadakichi Seven: Hideyoshi no Ougon</game><game id="39987">Tensai Bakabon</game><game id="39249">Sanma no Meitantei</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2368703-pro_yakyuu_satsujin_jiken.jpg</image></root>
