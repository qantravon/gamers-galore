After ending up in the Valley of Eodon, the Avatar must fight off the invading Myrmidex, hunt dinosaurs, and unite warring tribes to save the world.Like the other Worlds of Ultima title, Martian Dreams, The Savage Empire uses the Ultima VI engine, and offers a high level of interactivity with the environment, as well as mouse-based movement and VGA graphics.SNES versionThe SNES version of Savage Empire was released in Japan in 1995, five years after the original PC release. This version used the Ultima VII SNES engine and has greatly simplified gameplay, with the player controlling only the Avatar with no accompanying party. The SNES port is quite rare and was never translated into English.AvailabilityBeginning in 2012, gog.com began distributing The Savage Empire and its sequel Martian Dreams as free downloads.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/611023-useboxl_1_.jpg</image></root>
