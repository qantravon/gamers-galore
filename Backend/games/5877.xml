Rad Racer:  Players must complete a race along a custom track created for the Nintendo World Championships. Tetris:  Players must simply play Tetris and earn as high a score as possible in the time remaining. In the official competition, players had six minutes and twenty-one seconds to play through the game.  However, dip switches in the cartridge can be set to allow for different time limits.  Once time expires, the game ends and the player's score is tallied.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="15">Compilation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362090-nes_nintendoworldchampionships1990.jpg</image></root>
