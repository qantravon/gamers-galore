<root><id>5717</id><name>Last Action Hero</name><description>Overview Last Action Hero is a brawler that follows the plot of   Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie, released in the summer of 1993.  The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages.  Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks.  The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.  Last Action Hero has received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls.  In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as "one of the worst SNES games ever made."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6722">Final Fight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361944-nes_lastactionhero.jpg</image></root>
