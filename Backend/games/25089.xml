Look no further than LONPOS, with its straight forward        premise and large variety of puzzles to solve. Each puzzle revolves        around a rectangular playing field of 55 spaces. Using a set of twelve        pieces, the goal is to place every piece into the playing field, filling        it completely. The higher the level, the more pieces need to be fit into        the playing field correctly. Challenge yourself with two single-player        modes or bring a friend into the game and choose from more modes which        allow you to compete against or cooperate with the other person. When        you think your skills are worthy, use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to        check out how you compare against other LONPOS players or download        additional puzzles and backgrounds.     </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8272/1101505-lonpos1.jpg</image></root>
