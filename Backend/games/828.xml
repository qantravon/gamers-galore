It was a commercial failure, but is considered by many to be a cult classic. Harvester was made in 1994, but wasn't released until 1996. Because of this, its graphics were considered poor at the time.Harvester tackles many sensitive subjects such as pedophilia, cannibalism, rape, murder, incest, and so on. Because of this the game is banned in Germany and Australia. It was also cut in the UK to remove an FMV of a child biting a woman's thigh as it was accused of having sexual implications.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1353">The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery</game><game id="10187">Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands</game><game id="2695">I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/121483/1688863-harvester.jpg</image></root>
