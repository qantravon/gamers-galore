All that is left of humanity is two bases; one on Mars and one on the Moon. The game starts with the player taking control of the Lunar station and it's very few resources. It's up to the player to explore, research, expand and harvest resources on the planets and moons of the solar system while defending from attacks from the Mars colony. The goal is to terraform Earth and repopulate the planet by starting a new colony on Earth.   The game uses a mix of strategy through menus and a simplistic arcadeshooter when defending against Mars ships.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7217">Deuteros: The Next Millennium</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/686917-millennium_return_to_earth_eu_box_art.jpg</image></root>
