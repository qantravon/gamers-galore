Two downloadable episodes were made exclusively for Xbox 360, each big enough to qualify as an expansion. Those episode are finally available for PC in one package, extending the GTA experience with some excellent additive content.

Episodes from Liberty City is a stand-alone disc containing new multiplayer modes and two new single-player campaigns: The Lost &amp; Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. Between the two, you get more than 50 new music tracks, new radio stations and DJs, TV shows, vehicles, weapons and online modes. It's a hell of a deal regardless of how long it's been since GTA IV came out.

The new content offers the same recording features so you can take clips of your adventures and upload them to Rockstar Social. The multiplayer works the same as it does in GTA IV, except each episode's online world is self-contained. If your friend is playing GTA IV and you are playing The Lost and Damned, you won't be able to meet up. Each world has its own set of multiplayer modes, weapons and vehicles. It would be nice if all three were merged into one</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Adventure</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17322-1.jpg</image></root>
