<root><id>19626</id><name>World Heroes 2</name><description>Overview World Heroes 2 is a 2D fighting game developed by                ADK and published by               SNK for the              Neo Geo. It is a direct sequel to             World Heroes, adding six new playable characters and one new boss. Death Match mode from the previous game received an overhaul, adding and removing obstacles (mine fields, moving saws, laser beams, slippery floors, and smaller arenas) while completely changing the lifebar system to one large tug-of-war lifebar. Gameplay additions include taunting (standing far back while pressing the throw button), throw reversals (throwing at the moment you're being grabbed, can cause "throw battles") and projectile reflection (blocking at the very moment a projectile reaches you, similar to the         Just Defend system of          Garou: Mark of the Wolves). Â The game was ported to the    SNES and   TurboGrafx CD by  Takara. The original version of the game was released on the       Neo Geo CD with an arranged soundtrack and released on the      World Heroes Anthology compilation for the     PlayStation 2.Characters          Hanzo (based on Hanzo Hattori)            Fuuma (based on Fuma Kotaro)                          Kim Dragon (based on                          Bruce Lee)                          Janne D'Arc (based on                          Joan of Arc)                                                       Julius Carn (based on                                                         Genghis Khan)                          Muscle Power (based on                          Hulk Hogan)                          Brocken                          Rasputin (based on Grigori Rasputin)                    Mudman                   Ryoko Izumo (based on Ryoko Tami)                      Captain Kidd (based on William Kidd)                     Erick (based on Erik the Red)                 Johnny Maximum                  Shura (based on Nai Khanom Tom) Neo Geegus (boss, based on                                                      T-1000)                Dio (boss)</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14669">Virtua Fighter Animation</game><game id="13327">Art of Fighting 2</game><game id="3744">Def Jam: Fight for NY</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="22629">Rage of the Dragons</game><game id="29324">Breakers Revenge</game><game id="35844">Deadliest Warrior: Legends</game><game id="12151">Street Fighter Collection 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4737/400350-worldheroes2.jpg</image></root>
