The original version of the game was called "Smuggle Truck", and focused instead on transporting illegal cargo and immigrants across the border into the United States.After the game was rejected for its anti-government message, Owlchemy Labs decided to change some art assets, and created the final version of the game as seen on the App Store. The newly christened "Snuggle Truck," with a more innocent concept, was successfully approved. The PC and Mac editions of the game, which are distributed by the developers themselves, contain both versions of the game.GameplayIn the game you have to drive your car on a bumpy road to the finish within a time frame and not loose too many of your precious cargo. The game features a nearly endless stream of levels to conquer.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP SP2 or laterProcessor: 1 GHz CPUMemory: 512mb (1gb for Windows Vista or Windows 7)Hard Disk Space: 100mbVideo Card: Video card with 64mb of memoryDirectXÂ®: 9.0cSound: DirectX 9.0c-compliant sound cardMac System RequirementsOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.Processor: Intel MacMemory: 512mbHard Disk Space: 100mbVideo Card: Video card with 64mb of memory</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34383">Tiny Wings</game><game id="25239">Monster Trucks Nitro</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/155745/2173642-smuggle_truck.png</image></root>
