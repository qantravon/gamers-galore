<root><id>13161</id><name>Lords of Conquest</name><description>Lords of Conquest was an early global domination/war strategy game. Different territories could have resources which could be used to purchase weapons and build cities. Cities would then double the production of the resources in any adjacent territories owned by the player. The battles that took place didn't involve armies like Risk, but rather were based on the 'power' of each territory. The power was calculated by the number of adjacent allied territories, the proximity to a city, and the presence of a weapon or a horse. In the standard mode, the battles were always won by the territory with the higher power number. It was also possible to play in a Random mode that allowed for the random chance of a weaker number winning.The game also included multiple maps and a map editor.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10687">Risk</game><game id="3750">Sid Meier's Civilization</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/101045/1439064-l1.png</image></root>
