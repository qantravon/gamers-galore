It had the MLB license but not the license of the Player's Union, so fictionalized names (other than Griffey's) were used for the athletes. The fictional names are notable for the various themes that teams were given. For example, the Kansas City Royals were all named after United States presidents and the Baltimore Orioles are named after famous Baltimoreans.GameplayThe game features exhibition and season play, as well as a 1 or 2-player Home Run Derby mode. When pitching, the player can control the path of the ball in midair, which can make 2-player competitive play sometimes infuriating. Aside from this, basic gameplay is fairly straightforward. In-game stadiums resemble their real-life equivalents and include well-known features like Fenway Park's left field wall (the Green Monster) and Baltimore's brick facade of the B  O warehouse beyond right field that Ken Griffey struck with a ball during 1993's Home Run Derby.Fictional Name Team ThemesAtlanta Braves - Famous DJsBaltimore Orioles - Baltimore nativesBoston Red Sox - Cheers (TV Show) characters and Boston landmarksCalifornia Angels - Famous actorsChicago White Sox - Basketball players from St. John's UniversityChicago Cubs - Sports actions or nicknamesCincinnati Reds - Prolific writersCleveland Indians - Famous ActressesColorado Rockies - Famous people associated with horror moviesDetroit Tigers - Motown singersHouston Astros - CartoonistsKansas City Royals - Presidents of the United States of AmericaLos Angeles Dodgers - Punk rockers and other musicians from CaliforniaMilwaukee Brewers - Secret agents, detectives, and superhero secret identitiesMinnesota Twins - Book charactersMontreal Expos - 1980's English musiciansNew York Mets - Punk rockers from New YorkNew York Yankees - Former Yankee greatsOakland Athletics - Prolific authorsPhiladelphia Phillies - Philly landmarks and characters from the Rocky moviesSan Francisco Giants - Workers from Software CreationsSan Diego Padres - Punk rockers from EnglandSeattle Mariners - Workers from Nintendo of AmericaSt. Louis Cardinals - ComediansTexas Rangers - Western motifToronto Blue Jays - Wigan Warriors rugby team members</description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11803">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</game><game id="3894">Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run</game><game id="14051">Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr</game><game id="20835">MLB 08: The Show</game><game id="22596">Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</game><game id="5811">Baseball Stars</game><game id="2250">Triple Play 98</game><game id="1202">Triple Play 97</game><game id="17271">Triple Play 2002</game><game id="7000">Triple Play 2001</game><game id="9670">Triple Play Baseball</game><game id="14025">Triple Play 2000</game><game id="22849">Tecmo Super Baseball</game><game id="22848">MLB '98</game><game id="5682">MLB 06: The Show</game><game id="17874">MLB 2004</game><game id="20687">MLB Power Pros 2008</game><game id="6423">MLB Slugfest Loaded</game><game id="5123">MLB 99</game><game id="22724">MLB 07: The Show</game><game id="6736">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</game><game id="5259">Super Baseball 2020</game><game id="20876">Major League Baseball 2K8</game><game id="4636">Baseball Simulator 1.000</game><game id="9978">MVP Baseball 2005</game><game id="5295">MVP Baseball 2004</game><game id="18669">Super Baseball Simulator 1.000</game><game id="29193">ESPN Baseball Tonight</game><game id="24901">MLB 09: The Show</game><game id="24440">Major League Baseball 2K9</game><game id="36048">Nicktoons MLB</game><game id="23470">Home Run King</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/782527-griffey_jr_mlb_cover.jpg</image></root>
