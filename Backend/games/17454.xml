The developer Tiertex, had already ported the arcade version of Street Fighter 1 to the PC, and set out to create their own fighting game separate from the Street Fighter license. The player character is Kwam, a fighter from Korea, like all fighters, he sets out to prove his superiority to all other combatants. He journeys through Russia, Amsterdam, Spain, Germany, and finally Beirut.Human Killing Machine is considered to be very bad due to the very few frames of animation, and lack of any degree of parallax scrolling.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2343374-hkm.jpg</image></root>
