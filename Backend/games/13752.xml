The player uses a curser to move to a brainy, pick them up, then move them to the right spot. The catch is that the Brainies block each other so puzzles sometimes require the player to move each Brainy many times in a level.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4430/419601-brainies__the__u__00006.png</image></root>
