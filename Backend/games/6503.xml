<root><id>6503</id><name>Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</name><description>OverviewThe concept of the game is rather simple; youâ€™re a monkey inside a ball. Move your right analogue stick in a certain direction and the monkey begins to roll, get the monkey through the goal at the end of each level and you move onto the next. Sounds simple right? well that could not be further from the truth. The first level may only require a simple push forwards but as your progress onto more complexed and difficult courses your skills will be tested and so will your patience. This game is essentially    Super Monkey Ball and the   Super Monkey Ball 2 rolled up into one neat package. The same levels, the same mini-games and most importantly the same monkeys.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1710">Mercury Meltdown</game><game id="24194">Spectraball</game><game id="32434">Igneous</game><game id="9566">Marble Madness</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2536377-box_smbd.png</image></root>
