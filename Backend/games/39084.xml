It was widely criticized for just being a reissue of the then 7 year old predecessor, using graphical enhancements made by the mod community in 2005 (after the original game was made open source).An stand-alone expansion was released in 2008, Enemy Engaged 2: Desert Operations, adding three new scenarios. In 2009 Enemy Engaged 2 Gold was released, including both Enemy Engaged 2 and it's expansion.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="24">Flight Simulator</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37289">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark 2</game><game id="23043">Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark</game><game id="18759">Comanche 4</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/66643/2272779-enemy_engaged_2_cover.jpg</image></root>
