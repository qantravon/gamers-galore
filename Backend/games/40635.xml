Otokojuku, about a private school that teaches troubled teens ouendan - a form of male cheerleading that involves percussion instruments and chanting, best known to western gamers as the core mechanic of the Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents games. Both the manga and the anime series - which came out close to this game's release and is assuredly its main inspiration and reason for its existence - is extremely violent as well, and the game's nature as a brawler emphasizes this aspect.The player can select between four main characters, however they all look and play identically. Most of the game is a 2D side-scroller, though the game will switch to a depth-enhanced field - such as that seen in Double Dragon or Final Fight - for its boss battles.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39838">Sukeban Deka III</game><game id="39451">Sukeban Deka II: Shoujo Tekkamen Densetsu</game><game id="6608">River City Ransom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375139-sakigake_otokojuku_fc.jpg</image></root>
