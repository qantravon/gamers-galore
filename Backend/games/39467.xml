The game was released for iPad, iPhone, and Android on November 6, 2012.On November 7, 2012, 22 Cans tweeted that the first layer had been removed. In April 2013, an update was released containing the last 50 layers of the cube.On May 26, 2013, the cube was finally completed. The winner, UK resident Bryan Henderson, received a contract to work on 22Can's next project, Godus; according to a video posted online in which Molyneux announces the cube's completion, Henderson's role will be the game's "god," this will apparently grant him some unspecified level of creative control. Henderson will also receive a small percentage of profits from the game.GameplayThe top layer being removed by a firecracker, revealing the layer below.Upon running the game, the player was presented with a two color cube (initially black and green); however, these colors varied depending on the current layer. The black areas as shown on the right, represent the topmost layer of the cube, while green areas represent the next layer underneath.Gameplay consisted of tapping on the black areas of the cube to "chip away" cubelets (the individual cubes which the large cube is comprised). Upon the first tap, the camera zooms in on a section of the cube. From there players could pinch and scroll across the cube face to find a playable area, and then tap away to reveal the green blocks underneath. Players earned coins for each block removed; as well as this, there were bonuses for rapid sets of taps and clearing a whole screen.Coins could be used to purchase in-game items, such as firecrackers, bombs, and chisels, which break more than one cube at a time. Players could also use coins to purchase statistics about how the game is being played.Once the cube has finally been completed, the person to remove the final cubelet will be rewarded with a link to something; it will be entirely up to this person as to whether they share this mysterious content with anyone else.On December 11, 2012 22Cans released an update that now let the player see other players chipping away at the cube in real time.LayersEvery layer of the cube has its own unique design.
