Firstly, the maze in Smack Wacker is made up of concentric squares with gaps in the wall between them that constantly move. Secondly, the player has a health meter (labelled "Power") and is able to collide with bacteria a number of times before dying. Thirdly, while there are no power-ups on the board, the player can temporarily destroy the bacteria by running into them if one of their three "supers" are deployed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/2323378-smack_wacker.jpg</image></root>
