Players guide Yogi through a gorgeously illustrated Jellystone Park, while hopping on or dodging skunks, snowmen, and other cutesy enemies. The objective is to gather picnic baskets and reunite with Ranger Smith and Boo Boo. With no options, weapons, power-ups, or other complications to consider, gameplay is smooth and pleasant for youngsters, though seasoned gamers may find this title a bit unbearable.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14275">Yogi Bear's Math Adventures</game><game id="13866">Yogi Bear</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5177/427707-73_8.jpg</image></root>
