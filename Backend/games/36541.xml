<root><id>36541</id><name>Garage Inc</name><description>A time management game by casual game publishers and developers TransGaming Technologies. The game is set in Chicago during the 1920s and is about a young husband and father trying to make an honest living by running his own car garage, juggling angry customers at the same time as dealing with the mob who keep knocking on his door and causing all sorts of mischief. The player has to allocate coloured employees to specific cars, depending on what needs to be repaired, blue for body, red for electricity etc. The game becomes increasingly more challenging as the number of employees, customers and parking spaces increased from stage to stage. The player can upgrade his employees as well and chose to pay more for better workers or safe the money but risk running late and paying for overtime. The goal of the game is to pay off the debt with the mob.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10315">Diner Dash</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1909593-images.jpg</image></root>
