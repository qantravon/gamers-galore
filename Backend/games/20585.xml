This treasure, often an invention said to have shaped human evolution, such as fire and rope, will then evolve Darwin and his people to a stage closer to Homo sapiens. These treasures can then be used to expand the abilities and exploration options for the group.  As well as navigating these worlds, the player is expected to develop Darwin's village by finding materials in the field and carrying them back to various caves dotted around the levels. Any materials sent back this way can be used to build new structures, create health restoratives and increase the village population. New weapon types can also be developed and bought which will increase the attack power of Darwin and his group.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2480">Pikmin 2</game><game id="2405">Pikmin</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2491518-box_taod.png</image></root>
