<root><id>28139</id><name>Sub Rebellion</name><description>Overview You play as the latest prototype sub, capable of fighting sub and surface battles. The sub can be equipped with various upgrades that are unlocked by 'excavating' (shooting at) buried treasures from an ancient civilization revealed by the tectonic upheaval that preceded the game. While certainly a naval simulator game, movement and game play is much more streamlined and fluid than other examples of the greater genre. Â Submerged combat uses rapid-fire weaponry starting with the Needle Gun, and more powerful guided lock-on torpedoes, active sonar pings the area to reveal hidden treasures and identify enemies and obstacles. Surface action plays much the same way, though with a 'vulcan gun' and much faster missiles, and sub-surface targets are still capable of attacking you without warning, as the sonar deactivates but a passive radar points out helicopters and other surface threats.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21692">Naval Ops: Warship Gunner</game><game id="22826">Warship Gunner 2</game><game id="17282">Treasures of the Deep</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/47377/1135579-sub_rebellion.jpg</image></root>
