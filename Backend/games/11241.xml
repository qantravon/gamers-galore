<root><id>11241</id><name>Sopwith</name><description>Sopwith puts the player in classic aerial dogfights between Sopwith Camel airplanes. Armed with a mounted machine gun and three  bombs, the player must destroy an enemy base consisting of a control tower and fuel tanks, while evading or destroying other planes defending this base.Enemies will fire a hail of bullets at the lone plane, which can be avoided by looping and stalling the airplane in a series of impressive acrobatics. An experienced player may be able to lure an enemy ace toward a rocky incline and loop out of the way at the last possible moment to see the enemy plane crash into it.Sopwith also allows networked play between two computers.Sopwith was released for the  PC platform and supports  CGA graphics.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19924">Sopwith: The Author's Edition</game><game id="29374">Altitude</game><game id="18357">Triplane Turmoil</game><game id="16644">Triplane Turmoil II</game><game id="1098">Looping</game><game id="3751">Jumpjet</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9450/1224951-sopwith_001.png</image></root>
