The adventure itself is full of strange puzzles as well as ones that involve various logical thought.   The main interest in the game when it was released however was the fact that a golden sundial worth 6000 UK pounds was being given away to the first person to solve a puzzle which had clues hidden throughout the game. It took 3 years but eventually in 1985 two people did solve the puzzle and claim the prize. The solution involved being at a certain place in the UK on a certain day of the year (July 22nd since 22/7 is approximately Pi). Details on the puzzle and its solution can be found   here.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1357978-pimania_cassette.jpg</image></root>
