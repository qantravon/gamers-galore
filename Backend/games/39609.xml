<root><id>39609</id><name>Esper Boukentai</name><description>OverviewAn odd variation of the exploration-heavy platformers such as Metroid, Esper Boukentai (or "Esper Hero Team") has the player control a team of superpowered heroes as they attempt to fight off an invasion of sentient household items. Most of these household items will attack the player as soon as they're encountered, but a few will help them out with advice and other boons.The player can select between five different characters, each with their own level of jumping ability and Esper powers. The default boy can jump very high indeed and equip some sort of energy shield, for instance. All but the default character must be located and rescued before they can be selected for use however.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10152">Bucky O'Hare</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="7406">Super Mario Bros. 2</game><game id="33894">Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2306735-esper_boukentai_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
