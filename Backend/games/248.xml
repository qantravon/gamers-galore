Unique from those games made in 1993, this eroge fighting game allows you to select from a cast of all female fighters who fight in battle suits against one another. For the person who gets into the technical aspects, the suits are upgradable which comes in handy in the later fights as when you go through the girls the first time, you will start back from the begining and the difficulty levels with be increased. For the hentai lover, when you beat your opponent, you will access a gravure depicting the loser in various states of undress. The harder the difficulty, the more erotic the image will be. The control scheme is simplistic at best but fighting game fanatics will find these controls a bit frustrating. With the variable levels and upgradable abilities, Metal and Lace: The Battle of the Robo Babes is great for video game and eroge connoisseur alike.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/613888-dos_front.jpg</image></root>
