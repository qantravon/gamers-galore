The player's objective is to maneuver these women so that they catch the man's semen (which is colored yellow in the game for no particular reason) in their mouths before it hits the ground. When all the semen is caught, the two women turn to the screen and lick their lips. These game-play mechanics closely mimic those of a large group of games in which the object is to catch objects thrown by an ever-faster moving character. The game's objective is supported by an ad hoc explanation that "every uncaught sperm is sacred" and "could have been a famous doctor or lawyer," which refers to a song in the Monty Python film The Meaning of Life. A score of 69 points earns an extra life, and every 69 points thereafter (138, 207, 276, etc.) earns an extra life. A gender-reversed version of the game was later released as Philly Flasher, in which the player is tasked with controlling two male prisoners with visible erect penises as they attempt to catch drops of breast milk lactated by an ugly woman in a witch's hat (surely the height of eroticism). When they catch all the milk, they masturbate.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9094">Kaboom!</game><game id="24165">Fuck Quest</game><game id="14802">Custer's Revenge</game><game id="14272">Philly Flasher/Cathouse Blues</game><game id="34230">Coconuts</game><game id="6420">X-Man</game><game id="23184">Stroker</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/634818-b_beatemeatem_front.jpg</image></root>
