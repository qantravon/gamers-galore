You need to get at least 70% correct in order to "win" a round of quizzing, anything less is an immediate game over. Each girl asks questions about different subject matter that is of interest to them; ex., Noriko focuses on sports and anime trivia while Jung asks questions relating to science, Russia, and porn.    CHARACTERS     Takaya Noriko: The main character of Top wo Nerae, she is initially a clumsy pilot, but has great potential. She initially idolizes Kazumi.        Jung Freud:  Named after two famous psychologists, she is a Soviet pilot and a genius. She's also a bit mean-spirited at times, but still becomes a good friend of Noriko and Kazumi.         Amano Kazumi: An incredibly talented pilot, she's in love with coach Outa.   </description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/44493/1662774-cyberneticgakuenfront.jpg</image></root>
