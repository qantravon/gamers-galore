<root><id>9443</id><name>Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars</name><description>Fare Wars is a compilation of the two Dreamcast and Arcade originals, however it has no content from Crazy Taxi 3. Overall it was not critically well recieved like its predecessors, garnering reviews ranging from extremely poor to very good. There were many average scores awarded, and Game Almighty summed up a lot of people's feelings about the game: "It controls well, looks fine, sounds good...but it's Crazy Taxi, a game that is better off remembered instead of regurgitated".PS Vita CompatibilityDespite not being in the official compatibility list, Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars can be played on the PS Vita. To do this, the user must first download the game to the PS3. From there, go to Content Transfer on the PS Vita and select the game for transfer. Once complete, the game will show up on the Vita's menu.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33218">Super Taxi Driver</game><game id="17855">The Simpsons: Road Rage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/189625-937771_83688_front.jpg</image></root>
