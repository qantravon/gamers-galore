<root><id>24232</id><name>Ragnarok DS</name><description>OverviewRagnarok DS (know as Ragnarok Online DS in Japan) is an action RPG developed by          Gravity and was released in Japan on  December 18th, 2008 by GungHo Works and is currently scheduled for North American release by          XSEED on February 16th, 2010. The game is based on the popular MMORPG          Ragnarok Online and features the same graphical style and gameplay. Unlike Ragnarok Online, however, Ragnarok DS is not a fully-fledged MMORPG. The main focus of the game is actually the single-player story mode, which follows a young upcoming hero by the name of Ares who wants to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great adventurer and start his own guild. In the online mode, players will be able to take on a 50 floor randomized dungeon called the Tower of Mirages.
