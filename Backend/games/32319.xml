In this game however,  two players face off against each other in an effort to to destroy their opponents base. These bases are constructed by the players before the game starts and can have defensive turrets installed.  While the game is played in real time players can pause the action to issue orders to their units.</description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21175">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II</game><game id="12651">Ground Control</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19975/1483773-2847.jpg</image></root>
