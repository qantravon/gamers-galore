Players can join clans, team up with friends against computer-controlled bots, and even fight a Dragon Emperor.GameplayMission Against Terror feels and plays like Counter-Strike 1.6, pitting two teams against each other in various game modes with a constrained time limit. Players are not restricted to playing as specific military archetypes (such as "Terrorist" or "Counter-Terrorist") and are often found wearing silly costumes and dancing to regain their health.Game ModesBomb ModeGhost ModeMummy ModeDeathmatchTeam DeathmatchDragon Emperor ModeOccupy ModeAI ModeTerminator ModeSnowball ModeBounty ModeHybrid ModePK ModeTank WarsPC System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows 2000CPU: Intel Pentium 3 1 GhzRAM: 512 MBHDD: 1 GB FreeGraphics Card: NVidia GeForce Ti4200RecommendedOS: Windows XP / Vista / 7CPU: Intel Pentium 4 3 Ghz or betterRAM: 1 GB or moreHDD: 2 GB FreeGraphics Card: Geforce 6600 GTExternal Links Official Mission Against Terror Website at Suba Games</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29463">Alliance of Valiant Arms</game><game id="21591">Combat Arms</game><game id="40583">Operation 7</game><game id="7334">Crossfire</game><game id="36230">Blacklight Retribution</game><game id="33265">Project Blackout</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/17/171291/2371826-missionagainstterror.jpg</image></root>
