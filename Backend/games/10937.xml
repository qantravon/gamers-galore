Kato, who gave the higher score wrote, "...per the usual Army Men game I was running around frantically in order to aim properly. Holding down the R shoulder button fixes your orientation, but oftentimes you're so surrounded by foes it's not practical. On the other hand, I wish the environments were cluttered with scenery. There is little here that pushes the handheld's power. Multiplayer? That's MIA.Reiner wrote, "...As hard as it may seem to believe, Army Men Advance is actually decent. The combat is a tad cumbersome, but the animation is superb, and the environments are as colorful as can be".</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1799329-box_armymena.png</image></root>
