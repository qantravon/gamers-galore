<root><id>22099</id><name>MechScape</name><description> Back in 2006,       Jagex Games Studio started working on a game which they referred to as MechScape. Very few details were actually released about this game upto its cancellation. The game was supposedly nearing its release when they decided to scrap the entire project and start over with a brand new game, because they didn't feel MechScape was up to their standards.Â On June 14, 2010, Jagex Games Studio announced that they had scrapped the MechScape project and that the development team had decided to remake the game in its entirety due to how disappointing the game had ended up after extensive development time. This new project was renamed    Stellar Dawn. This new MMORPG is planned for release in 2011, and several concepts and other bits from the MechScape project will be used in its development.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2268">RuneScape</game><game id="9437">Star Wars: Galaxies - An Empire Divided</game><game id="9681">Star Wars: Galaxies - Jump to Light Speed</game><game id="13057">Star Wars: Galaxies - Trials of Obi-Wan</game><game id="7318">Star Wars: Galaxies - Episode III Rage of the Wookiees</game><game id="23411">Runescape Classic</game><game id="29122">Stellar Dawn</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8641/300725-mechscape1.png</image></root>
