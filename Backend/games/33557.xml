<root><id>33557</id><name>Back to the Future</name><description>Overview Different than the NES version of     Back to the Future, this version for early home computers has the player controlling Marty, and trying to herd his parents into spending time with each other and falling in love. Gameplay is based around five areas ("rooms") and a central scrolling hub.  NPCs are entirely controlled by    artificial intelligence, and wander around the areas on their own. If left alone, Marty's parents will avoid each other. To combat this (and keep school bully Biff from interfering), the player can collect items to lead specific characters around.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117445/1665803-bttfc64.jpg</image></root>
