Developed and published by JoyBits Ltd., the game was originally released on the iPhone, but was later released as an online flash game as well. The game has a total of possible combinations (known as Elements) and  features 21 item groups. There are a huge variety of elements that range  from basic items such as fire and wind to humans, sex and airplanes.   Gameplay The creation interface Manipulated solely by touch, Doodle God has a very simplistic control scheme that involves merely opening up to two item categories and then tapping on the different available items. The game also provides a list of all the combinations discovered as well as hints which are available every 3 minutes.   Item Groups Some of the groups in Doodle God:LifeFireAirEarthToolsTransportationWaterMonstersHumansFood and DrinkVegetationBuildingsAnimalsBiology</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38317">Doodle God 2</game><game id="40151">Doodle Farm</game><game id="40150">Doodle Devil</game><game id="38828">Little Inferno</game><game id="35023">Alchemy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103101/1514454-doodle_god_512x512_1.png</image></root>
