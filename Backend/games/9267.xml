As a limited time offer, Sony later stopped including the free voucher with the Network Adaptor, but would eventually include the game with the Greatest Hits version of Twisted Metal: Black.    The servers for the game were shut down on June 30th, 2008.    Network FeaturesThe game allowed for 4 players over a broadband connection (limited to only 2 if on a dial-up connection) to duke it out online. Later, (through server-side updates by the developers) the count was raised to 8 players over a broadband connection, while the player count for users bound to a dial-up connection remained at two.  Additionally, originally the game featured a lobby system devoid of any chat communication -- the server-side updates eventually brought forth a chat system, usable either with an on-screen keyboard or a USB keyboard.    Game Modes, Arenas and Vehicles  See Twisted Metal: Black page for full information on Cars and Arenas.  All 15 cars and every arena from the full game were available in this release.
