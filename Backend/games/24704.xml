The game starts out on the familiar freeway/river map of the old games, but pretty soon players are thrust into new environments that Frogger could only dream about in his retro day. This remake is probably most remembered for it's brutal time limits.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9450">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</game><game id="6301">Croc 2</game><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="7836">Spyro the Dragon</game><game id="1563">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage</game><game id="1753">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</game><game id="11371">Gex: Enter the Gecko</game><game id="8660">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</game><game id="12909">Crash Bandicoot: Warped</game><game id="40238">Asteroids</game><game id="41489">PlayStation Home Arcade</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9288/828184-froggercover.png</image></root>
