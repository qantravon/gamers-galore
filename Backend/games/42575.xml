He rarely slept, and even with 24 hours in a day, it was not enough for him. Once during a trip, he gets into trouble. Now he's lying on the cold ground, buried beneath his bicycle. Slides of various moments fly through his head. Will his memories return? Will he be able to stand up again? You must help him. You have about 630 beats of the heart to restore his past.</description><genres /><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/17960-1.jpg</image></root>
