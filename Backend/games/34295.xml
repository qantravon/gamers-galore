It is one of Taito's earliest NES titles and the second to be made specifically for the system, rather than being a conversion of one of Taito's many successful Arcade games.The goal of the game is to reach the kendo tournament before time runs out - this time limit is represented by Musashi's faithful hound To-ichi running across the bottom of the screen. Along the way, Musashi must defeat various enemies roaming around and collect sword icons. There are three such icons, each representing a different type of swing - high, medium and low. Once the end of every third stage has been reached, Musashi fights a regional champion at kendo in a one-on-one fight. He can use the icons he collected on the way to launch special attacks to defeat his opponent faster.The player can also opt to play against a human or computer opponent in the one-on-one battles only.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/2129437-578307_18524_front.jpg</image></root>
