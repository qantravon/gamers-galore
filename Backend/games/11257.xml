The game was built on the   Lithtec graphics engine, an engine created and used more successfully by  Monolith Productions.    Critical Reception Developed by     Anivision, Gods and Generals was released in 2003 to extremely bad reviews. Particularly maligned were the game's numerouos and severe technical issues. The game suffered from poor framerate, lack  Taking cover made easier by hopping inside a tree.of a proper physics engine, and broken AI. The combination of the poor AI and physics would often lead to enemies running into and sometimes through walls in a futile attempt to get to the player. At other times, enemies would not activate properly, leading them to stand motionless while the player shot them to death.  Gods and Generals was made at the request of the movie producers for the sole purpose of generating interest in the film counterpart. As such it is widely considered to be one of the prime examples of a movie-licensed game done wrong.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24858">Darkest of Days</game><game id="25887">History Channel: Civil War - Secret Missions</game><game id="3522">Civil War: A Nation Divided</game><game id="14229">The History Channel: Civil War - Great Battles</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/972874-gods_and_generals.367534.jpg</image></root>
