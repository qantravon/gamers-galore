Instead of solving crimes by investigating various suspects, as was the goal in previous games, your task this time is to find the missing pages of the diary in order to piece together what happened to the girl and unlock the secrets of Ravenhearst.   GameplayJust like in any Photo-hunt videogame, Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst only involves you by clicking in any particular area of the screen, searching for particular objects. The game also includes a little puzzle solving.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29127">Mystery Case Files: Madame Fate</game><game id="32423">Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst</game><game id="28002">Drawn: The Painted Tower</game><game id="32731">Annabel</game><game id="32841">Intrigue At Oakhaven Plantation</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2200243-cover.jpg</image></root>
