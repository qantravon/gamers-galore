Players are required to pick up customers from numbered platforms and to drop them off on another numbered platform. As with Space Taxi, the game included audible speech from customers to instruct the player which platform to drop them off on.Unlike Space Taxi, Air Taxi included multi-player allowing up to 5 players to play through the levels.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6554">Space Taxi 2</game><game id="6428">Space Taxi</game><game id="27456">Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge</game><game id="8453">Crazy Machines 2</game><game id="39687">Crazy Machines</game><game id="34075">Crazy Machines Elements</game><game id="14836">Crazy Machines: The Wacky Contraptions Game</game><game id="22843">Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 2</game><game id="17194">Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1</game><game id="10218">World Heroes Anthology</game><game id="7751">Art of Fighting Anthology</game><game id="21594">Slaves to Armok II: Dwarf Fortress</game><game id="6149">Ancient Domains of Mystery</game><game id="33763">Elminage Original</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
