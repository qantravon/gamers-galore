You must then take the oil to a place on the level and drop it down to make a car appear. Once enough oil has made the car completely appear it drives off and the next level starts. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5278/427253-turmoil_msx.jpg</image></root>
