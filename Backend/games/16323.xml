When you collect all of them, the game plays "In the Hall of the Mountain King". The main enemy in the game is a spider who can catch you and cocoon you. Â If caught by the spider, you have some time to wiggle yourself free. If the spider passes by you once you can live but if he passes twice, you die.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3087">Spelunker</game><game id="14533">Miner 2049er</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366203-a5200_mountainking.jpg</image></root>
