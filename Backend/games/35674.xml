Like in games such as Nintendogs, you will have to feed and play with your zombie. You can dress your zombie and have the choice between a male or female zombie. Like in other simulation titles, the zombie has a little playground where he walks around and where you can play with or torture him. Throw him some brains to make him happy or whip out the flamethrower to show him who's boss. The zombie will react to the way you treat it. As the game goes on, you'll unlock new objects to use on your zombie and minigames such as seeing how far you can fling your zombie.The game is set for an October 2011 release and is aiming for a teen rating. The game will use Street Pass , letting you trade unlocked items with friends.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10148">Nintendogs</game><game id="31736">Nintendogs + Cats</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/135472/1867452-pet_zombies_boxart.jpg</image></root>
