<root><id>23062</id><name>Sega Super GT</name><description>Released in 1996, Sega Super GT, or SCUD (Sports Car Ultimate Drive) Race as it's known outside of America, is the first driving title to use the Sega Model 3 hardware. Four cars are selectable- the Porsche 911 GT2 (easy), Ferrari F40 (intermediate), Dodge Viper GTS-R (advanced), and the McLaren F1 GTR (expert).  Four courses are selectable- Dolphin Cove (beginner), airport (beginner), ancient ruins (advanced), and Rome (expert). Driving mechanics are like Ridge Racer, with a bigger focus on drifting than in Daytona USA. Driving on the edge of control is key to getting good lap times and winning. As with Daytona, four viewpoints are selectable- bumper, in-car, behind the car, and behind the car with a higher angle of vision. Up to eight players can play at once. </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22135">Daytona USA</game><game id="22802">Daytona USA 2</game><game id="10050">OutRun 2</game><game id="2158">Ridge Racer</game><game id="25225">Need for Speed: SHIFT</game><game id="11607">Ridge Racer Revolution</game><game id="2453">R4 Ridge Racer Type 4</game><game id="23244">Rave Racer</game><game id="25979">Super GT 24h</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/506514-sega_sgt.jpg</image></root>
