<root><id>9468</id><name>The Graveyard</name><description>OverviewThe Old Lady sitting on a bench.The Graveyard is less a "video game" (in the traditional sense of the word) and more an experiment in wordless poetry and storytelling.Buying the full version of The Graveyard adds only one feature, the possibility of death. The full version of the game is exactly the same as the trial, except every playthrough offers the small chance that she may die. It is unclear exactly how this is supposed to encourage people to buy the game.CreditsThe Graveyard is designed by Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn. Animations are by Laura Raines Smith. Music composed by Gerry De Mol. Sound effects are by Kris Force.PC System RequirementsOperating System: Microsoft® Windows® XP or VistaProcessor: 1.5 GhzMemory: 256 MBHard disk space: 50 MBVideo Card: NVIDIA® GeForce™ or ATI™ Radeon® Video Card (no integrated graphics)Sound: Any soundDirectX® Version: 9.0c</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14793">Passage</game><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="971">The Endless Forest</game><game id="23677">The Path</game><game id="33629">Dear Esther</game><game id="37702">Thirty Flights of Loving</game><game id="41515">Bientôt l'été</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7003/929865-thegraveyard.jpg</image></root>
