Unlike the original MechWarrior, this title changed its cockpit perspective to an isometric view similar to contemporary titles like Desert Strike and its sequels, leading to the graphics being completely overhauled from the previous title on the system. It was released on the Sega Genesis as Battletech: A Game of Armored Combat.GameplayThe game has the player control a Mech outfitted with an arsenal of missiles and energy weapons in missions that take place on a large map. Like the titles in the Strike series, the player can freely roam around and explore the mission's map before tackling the objectives of the stage. The main single player mode in the came is a campaign that tasks them with several objectives spanning various missions. These can be getting to objective points, clearing out enemies, or escorting convoys across the map. One of the major changes to the game is the introduction of a cooperative two player mode where one player controls the bottom half of the Mech to navigate it around the battlefield while the other player controls the top half of the Mech and its arsenal independently.</description><genres><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9336">Urban Strike</game><game id="1">Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf</game><game id="2180">Jungle Strike</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23944/2193890-mechwarrior.jpg</image></root>
