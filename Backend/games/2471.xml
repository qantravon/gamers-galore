The other game was   Blue Lightning.  In Vid Grid, the video of a music video was chopped up into a grid (like a 3x3 square) and randomly rearranged.  Some pieces may have been flipped vertically or horizontally. As the music video played it was up to the player to reassemble the pieces into a coherent image. Once the video was reassembled the player could watch the rest of the music video in its unscrambled form.   The music videos contained in Vid Grid were mainly popular MTV fair from the mid-1990's. Some of the bands represented were Aerosmith, Van Halen and Jimmy Hendrix. </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2059549-vid_grid_front.jpg</image></root>
