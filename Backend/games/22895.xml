<root><id>22895</id><name>Godzilla Kaiju Daikessen</name><description>Widely known as the gold-standard for Godzilla games, Kaiju Daikessen was a Godzilla tournament fighter, featuring not only the classic Godzilla monsters done in wonderfully detailed sprites, but also the classic Godzilla music and themes. What more could you want?  Unfortunately this title was only released in Japan. However, it was rumored to come out in the U.S. at one point under the title Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters. There would not be another Godzilla tournament fighter similar to this game until  Destroy All Monsters Melee, which came out for the Xbox and GameCube platforms. But even that title was lacking the recognizable music and themes of the classic Godzilla films.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="243">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</game><game id="1235">Street Fighter</game><game id="15584">Virtua Fighter</game><game id="707">Virtua Fighter 5</game><game id="10081">Tekken</game><game id="18753">Tekken 5</game><game id="7792">Dead or Alive 4</game><game id="19651">War of the Monsters</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6529/465630-kaiju_daikessen.jpg</image></root>
