Early on in his adventure, he finds a magic amulet that grants him the strength and power of the Black Buccaneer himself, which he must use to fend off an assortment of rival pirates, apes, and other enemies. The game was released to largely poor reviews; Ryan Davis, in his review of the game for GameSpot, awarded the game a score of 3.9 out of 10; his criticism mainly focused on its existence as a mediocre cash-in on the Pirates of the Caribbean film series.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18261">Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2525228-box_plotbb.png</image></root>
