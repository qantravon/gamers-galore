The object of the game is to have your organism rotate to absorb other colored, smaller organisms (known as goobugs) with a tentacle of the same color. Players are able to adjust the difficulty of the game by choosing the number of flailing tentacles they want to use. If players are unable to match the right color of goobug with the right color of tentacle, then the organisms health will decrease, and the spot on the tentacle where the goobug hit will fall off. The game will end when the organism runs out of health.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="15849">flOw</game><game id="35697">Solar 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1283781-rotozoa_logo.jpg</image></root>
