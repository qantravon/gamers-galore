It uses motion controls for the Wii and will also have Kinect support on the Xbox 360, and utilizes the game engine developed for The Bigs 2. The game uses licenses from 30 Major League Baseball teams and real players can team up with, or face off against Nicktoon characters instead.GameplayThis is not a baseball sim but rather an arcade-style baseball game. The gameplay is all done with motion controls. Swinging the bat, pitching and throwing are all done using the motions specific to each activity, however the Xbox 360 version will still allow for normal controller play. The game will also feature realistic venues, as well as venues based on the Nicktoons.CharactersCharacterShowSpongebob SquarepantsSpongebob SquarepantsPatrick StarSpongebob SquarepantsSandy CheeksSpongebob SquarepantsThe Flying DutchmanSpongebob SquarepantsLarry the LobsterSpongebob SquarepantsDudley PuppyT.U.F.F.
