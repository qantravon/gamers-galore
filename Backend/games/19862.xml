<root><id>19862</id><name>Game Over II</name><description>With the original protagonist, Arkos, now captured and imprisoned by the vengeful heirs of Gremla, you take control of a new character called Major Locke. In the original Spanish game, Phantis, Major Locke was the girlfriend of Arkon (Arkos). The game was renamed and the story changed when it was released outside of Spain. There are mixed reports that say that the original English version had you play as Arkos and your mission was to rescue Commander Serena. However I have yet to see a review that describes this story. Gameplay was a mixture of scrolling shoot â€˜em up and arcade platforming.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19589">Game Over</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7804/2452612-game+over+2.jpg</image></root>
