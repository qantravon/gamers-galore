Haseo had just defeated Tri-Edge and AIDA showed up to steal Atoli’s epitaph. Haseo and his friends take Atoli back to the guild hall. Once there Yata informs them that they have been moved to an AIDA server which is the reason for the recent strange activity. The World then begins experiencing many more issues and no one is able to log off the game. The players determine that Haseo should go and ask Zelkova the leader of a friendly guild called Moon Tree about what is going on. When Haseo and company reach the guild hall they are welcomed by a large group of PKers. Haseo then receives an email from a member of Moon Tree giving a place to meet. Once Haseo arrives at the meeting point he witnesses a meeting between Ovan and another player. Haseo questions Ovan about many things, and Ovan only responds with cryptic messages. This is where the main story of the game takes off. Gameplay OverallHaseo's third form. The battle system and the exploration are almost identical to the first game in the series. See .hack//G.U. Vol. 1: Rebirth for the basic gameplay mechanics. You can load clear data from .hack//G.U. Vol. 1:Rebirth to regain everything you had in the first game, and unlock some extra features in this game.  DifferencesThere are a few gameplay changes in this entry to the series. Haseo enters his third form in this game. In the previous game he could only use daggers and swords, but with the addition of his new form he now adds Scythes to his repertoire.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12099">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2116217-box_dothackgu2.png</image></root>
