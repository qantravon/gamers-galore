<root><id>19116</id><name>Cel Damage</name><description>OverivewCel Damage is a car combat game, released for the Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube. The main focus of the game is a derby-deathmatch style of play, all done in cel-shaded graphics. Besides the deathmatch mode, there is also a "capture the flags" mode, and a gate racing mode. The game doesn't offer a huge amount of characters, yet the ones included are memorable and reinforce the main strength of the game: it is awkwardly funny and easy to play. Although it feels shallow, this game appeals to some because of its unusual visuals and its overall simplicity.CharactersVioletSinderB.T.
