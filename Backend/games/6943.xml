Nibbles was written in QBasic programming language by Rick Raddatz and was included with Microsoft's MS-Dos 5.0 and above. It was included mainly to be a demonstration of the QBasic programming language.  It's development was influenced by Mozaik Software's 1984 Amstrad CPC game, Nibbler.  GameplayThe objective of Nibbles is to navigate a snake between walls and obstacles while consuming the numbers 1 to 9 in sequence. Each number that is consumed increases the length of the snake slightly. While navigating the snake towards each number, the player must avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body. Collision with walls or objects results in the player losing a life. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.Once all the numbers have been consumed on a stage, the player is then advanced to the next more difficult stage. As the player progresses through the stages the difficulty increases by the addition of more walls/obstacles and/or faster snake movement speed.There is also a two player mode where each player controls a separate snake on the same play field. Each player will aim to collect the numbers before the other player in order to make their snake longer and therefore easier to obstruct their opponent's path.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23121">Nibbler</game><game id="28405">Light Cycles</game><game id="9383">Pizza Worm</game><game id="42123">Nimble Quest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/70437/1536111-nibbles_1.jpg</image></root>
