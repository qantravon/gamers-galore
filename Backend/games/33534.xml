While piloting around your craft, you launch 'gliders'. Gliders are famous self-replicating, moving patterns in artificial life. When one of your gliders intersects with enemy turrets and cells, they replicate using the standard A.L. rules. Releasing your attack key detonates all controlled cells, points are tallied and the game continues.   The game is available free to play;   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/flash/la2/index.html</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/98709/1663700-picture_9.png</image></root>
