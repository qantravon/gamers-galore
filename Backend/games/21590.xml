<root><id>21590</id><name>Mass Effect 2</name><description>OverviewThe Illusive Man, a mysterious figure that aids Commander Shepard in his mission.Mass Effect 2 is a third-person science-fiction action RPG developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the Xbox 360 and PC on January 26, 2010 (and the PlayStation 3 almost a year later).Set two years later after the events of the original Mass Effect, players control Commander Shepard as he (or she) teams up with Cerberus, a human supremacist organization that resurrected him after his violent death from an unknown force, to investigate why human colonies are being abducted. Along the way, Shepard must assemble an elite inter-specie team from the dark, seedy underbelly of the galaxy, and prepare for what appears to be a suicide mission.It has similar, but significantly redesigned gameplay â€“ such as the ability to interrupt conversations via renegade and paragon actions, a completely revamped inventory system, health regeneration as opposed to requiring the use of medigel, and an improved combat system that includes facilitating cover, as well as altered class development options. Mass Effect 2 focuses much more on shooter aspects than the first installment did although the dialogue trees and streamlined RPG mechanics are still present. Mass Effect 2 has been positioned as the dark second act of the trilogy.Players once again fill the shoes of Commander Shepard, the main protagonist from the first game and allows veteran players of the first title to import their saves allowing for a variety of decisions to carry over to Mass Effect 2. None of the gear, abilities, credits, and etc, however, will be carried over, but characters continued in this manner due get a credit, ability, and experience bonus. Due to the many gameplay changes from the first game, players are allowed to change the appearance, but not gender, and the class of Commander Shepard upon importing their save file from Mass Effect.The PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2, released on January 18, 2011, uses an enhanced graphics engine while including the Blood Dragon Armor, Kasumi: Stolen Memory, Overlord, and Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC for free. In addition, because the original Mass Effect was never released on the PlayStation 3, the game includes an interactive digital comic which retells the events of Mass Effect while allowing players to make key decisions about the story (which, in turn, applies the decisions to the player's created character). This comic, known as Mass Effect: Genesis, was later released for the Xbox 360 and PC as paid DLC. The PlayStation 3 version also has exclusive paid DLC consisting of pre-order content from the Xbox 360 and PC versions.GameplayCombat mechanicsBattling a heavy mechMass Effect 2 has radical gameplay changes since the first installment; however, overall the basis of the game remains the same. Commander Shepard must acquire a team, can use this team in missions, but only two squadmates at a time, and levels up as the game progresses. The game remains a third person, cover based shooter. The most radical gameplay changes are the re-assortment of classes, weapons skills and the combat experience. Classes have been refined and there abilities have been changed to add more impact, meanwhile weapons have been assorted into groups. The radial menu to use skills remains intact, but unlike the first game, only one skill can be used at a time. In addition, a global cooldown for powers is employed rather than the individual cooldowns used in the previous game.InventoryThe inventory has also been radically redefined as an inventory "menu" is almost non-existent and "loot" has been limited to money and weapons upgrades. The player chooses his load-out before a mission, and can change his armor at an armory in his/her cabin. The overall HUD (Heads-Up Display) has also been radically changed. Health is regenerative, and enemies health/armor/shields are all shown in bars when a player's reticule hovers over them. Combat has been changed by opting out of unlimited ammo and adding ammo through the use of "heat sinks." These are standard for all of Shepard's weapons and are used throughout the galaxy being dropped by almost any dead enemy. Heavy weapons have been added as an extra weapon class to give Commander Shepard a strategic advantage when a situation goes out of control. These use Power Cells as their ammunition system, and like the heat sinks are universal in all heavy weapons. The heavy weapons range from the Arc Projector, which fires out lightning, to the M-920 Cain which causes a miniature nuclear explosion.The overall tone of the game is also darker and grittier. While the first game had Shepard touring the Citadel and exploring the Mass Effect universe the second game is more linear. The story has multiple uses of crime gangs, mercenary groups, and warlords and takes the player through the darker part of the galaxy. This includes slums in Omega, and war-torn worlds such as the krogan homeworld of Tuchanka.Dialogue Trees/ Interrupt FeatureIn terms of dialogue, a new interrupt feature have been added where the player is given the option to interrupt a conversation by performing either a Renegade or Paragon action. Also, having the option for paragon/renegade dialogue choices is no longer managed by a skill, but instead by the overall points a player has accumulated over the course of the game, which is defined by his/her actions.Hammerhead (Mako's replacement)The DLC Hammerhead vehicle, hoped to improve upon the MakoThe Mako has not made a return, and instead planetary scanning has taken its place. Planetary Scanning opts out of landing on planets that look, for the most part, the same and instead the player takes control of the Normandy and scans a planet for minerals which can be used for upgrades. Instead of landing on planets to do sidequests, Shepard can partake in "N7 Missions" which offer more depth and a more varied amount of scenery. The Hammerhead was added later through free DLC which tries to refine the Mako experience.Save ImportMass Effect 2 allows the player to use a save-import system, wherein a player can import their character from Mass Effect. This imports their character's look, and choices made in the first game which will have impact in the second game. This will effect whether certain characters appear or not, whether some quests are available, and reactions from people around the player to his/her previous actions. This tracking of choices will continue onwards to Mass Effect 3.Classes (Shepard)New players to the game can choose from six different classes for Commander Shepard, each focusing on a different set of abilities for use in combat situations. These abilities are split into three categories:Combat - Focused on weapon efficiency and physical fitness. Combat users primarily have the ability to use different ammo types for their weapons.Biotic - Focused on special abilities using the character's bio-amp implants.

(He can switch out powers, at a price, as a research upgrade).Squad RosterThe base game includes thirteen AI companions that can join Shepard (two at a time) in all of his/her combat missions.

Final evolution is a choice between Deadly Shadow Strike, which increases the damage inflicted, and Rapid Shadow Strike, which reduces the recharge time after a successful assassination with the Shadow Strike.Tactical Cloak - Allows the user to become invisible for a limited amount of time (or until the user either fires his/her weapon or uses another power). At rank 2 and above, the user's weapon damage is increased while the power is in effect. Final evolution is a choice between Enhanced Cloak, which increases the power duration, and Assassination Cloak, which increases the weapon damage boost.Tech Armor - Deploys a special holographic armor that boosts the maximum shields of the user by a certain percentage.

Shots have a chance to overload synthetic enemies or overheat enemy weaponry (which, in either case, temporarily disables them).Incendiary Ammo - Shots cause fire damage to enemies, igniting most enemies (which causes further damage and sometimes causes them to panic). Improved version adds an explosive charge to each shot, igniting enemies within a 3-meter radius of the bullet impact.Shredder Ammo - Increases weapon damage against unprotected organics.Warp Ammo - Increased weapon damage against biotic barriers, armor, and health, with further damage dealt to enemies being affected by biotic effects.ArsenalIn Mass Effect 2 the number of weapons has been increased since the last game. This included adding completely new weapons, such as the Heavy Weapons subset. BioWare has also released DLC packs that include more weapons. The weapons can be classified into six categories and 3-4 weapons within each subset excluding the Heavy Weapons subset which include:Assault RiflesM-8 Avenger: A common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle. Accurate when fired in short bursts, and deadly when fired on full auto. The Avenger is effective at penetrating shields, armor, and biotic barriers. The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The avenger has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine.M-15 Vindicator: A battle rifle favored by assassins and elite mercenaries that fires in highly accurate five-round bursts, and effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers, Upgrades the Avenger Assault Rifle. Manufactured by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Blue Suns mercenary group, the Vindicator is quickly gaining popularity in the Terminus Systems.M-76 Revenant: Unleashes a storm of deadly high-velocity slugs. Less accurate than an assault rifle, but has a high ammo capacity and deals much more damage. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Vindicator Battle Rifle. This custom-made machine gun features technology not widely available. Protected against replication by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, only the richest and most powerful warlords can afford this weapon.M-96 Mattock Heavy Rifle: Bringing a flash from the past, the Mattock is an old rifle modified to work with thermal clips. The idea of bringing the gun on the ship was of joint origin coming up from Miranda Lawson, and the ship's AI, EDI. Firing at medium range and being semi automatic, the Mattock is effective against armor, shields, and barriers. The Mattock is a semi-automatic hybrid weapon with an assault rifle's low heat production and a sniper rifle's punch. Though it does not have a sniper rifle's precision scope, marksmen favor its increased power over that of an assault rifle to bring down hardened targets, its lack of a fully automatic setting is advertised as a feature rather than a shortcoming since it curbs a soldier's tendency to spray inaccurate fire under stress. (Firepower Weapons Pack)Geth Pulse Rifle: A Geth assault rifle that is effective against shields and biotic barriers. They are rarely recovered from the battlefield, and are generally considered difficult to maintain or repair and have yet to be replicated by any organic species. Though it is comparable to the M-15 Vindicator in its effectiveness, there are two major anomalies that differentiate it from other assault rifles. First, it has a variable rate of fire due its mass effect field generation technology following a sine curve. Second, its slugs are lighter than standard M-8 Avenger slugs, but they are encased in a phasic envelope. It should be noted that this weapon is only available to the player on a Hardcore or Insanity-level play-through. It can be found on Haestrom.ShotgunsM-22 Eviscerator Shotgun: A non-military civilian designed shotgun. The unique ammunition generator utilized by the Eviscerator makes it a powerful anti-armor weapon with a longer range than standard shotguns. The illegal nature of the design prevents this weapon from be distributed to military entities. This lethal close range weapon is available as part of a download including the Cerberus Assault Armor and can be acquired through the Cerberus Network.M-23 Katana: Common military shotgun. Deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Katana is a common mercenary weapon and is also popular on colonies with varren infestations.M-27 Scimitar: An elite military shotgun capable of rapid fire, this weapon is deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Upgrades the Katana Shotgun. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Scimitar features twin mass effect generators, giving it a more rapid rate of fire than a traditional shotgun. This weapon was created for the Eclipse mercenary band but is rapidly becoming popular with Blood Pack mercenaries, as well.M-300 Claymore: Very rare Krogan shotgun. Deals high damage at short range; less effective at long range. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Scimitar Assault Shotgun. The Claymores is of human design but is only used by Krogan as the kickback from a single shot is enough to break a human's arm. Its large slugs are effective against armored targets. Protected by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, this weapon is nearly impossible to reproduce and its prohibitively expensive.Geth Plasma Shotgun: Coming out of one of Cerberus cell's researching the Geth. The Geth Plasma Shotgun is deadly weapon. This three-barreled Geth weapon fires miniature but potent cluster rounds of superconducting projectiles and has a longer range than standard shotguns. A two stage trigger system allows for either quick-fire capacitors or a charge-and-release attack to electrify the projectiles as they exit the weapon. As the rounds hit the target, they fragment and electricity arcs between the pieces, flash-converting the air to conductive plasma. The resulting impact, heat, and electrical charge overloads shields and barriers and causes massive trauma to unarmored targets. (Firepower Weapons Pack)Sniper RiflesM-92 Mantis: Powerful sniper rifle able to take out most targets in a single shot. Incredibly accurate at long range, but rate of fire is slow. Effective against armor, but weaker against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Devlon Industries, the Mantis is primarily used by police and planetary militia groups. The prevalence of kinetic barriers has made this weapon less popular with the military, but it is used more frequently in the Terminus system where defenses are less common.M-97 Viper: Rapid-fire military sniper rifle. Incredibly accurate and deadly at long range, these weapons are popular amongst infiltrators and assassins. Very effective against armor; somewhat effective against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Mantis Sniper Rifle. Rosenkov Materials developed this deadly weapon in response to the rising prevalence of kinetic barriers. While kinetic barriers still offer some protection from this weapon, it's sheer power and rapid rate of fire make it capable of quickly killing almost any target, regardless of its defenses.M-98 Widow: Accurate and deadly anti-material rifle. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Viper Sniper Rifle. Weighing in at 39 kilograms, the Widow Anti-Material Rifle is primarily used by sniper teams in assault missions against armored vehicles or Krogan. While kinetic barriers offer effective protection on vehicles, the kind generated by conventional military field generators are far too weak against the Widow. The Widow was never designed to be carried and fired by a human. Although this modified model can be carried, no ordinary human could fire it without shattering an arm.M-29 Incisor: The Incisor is one of a new wave of military and police sniper rifles designed to overload active defenses such as shields. Firing three shots with each pull of the trigger, the Incisor's burst is so fast that all three rounds will be in the target by the time the barrel has moved a millimeter, increasing its stopping power without sacrificing accuracy. As an added benefit, the noise of the burst is comparable to a single rifle shot in duration, making it no easier to locate the sniper by sound. (Aegis Pack or part of Digital Deluxe Edition)Heavy PistolsM-3 Predator: Reliable, accurate sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Elanus Risk Control, the Predator is a valued as powerful, deadly, and relatively inexpensive weapon. While it is not generally deployed in the military, where kinetic barriers are common, it's still very popular in the Terminus Systems where these defenses are less common.M-6 Carnifex Hand Cannon: Highly accurate and lethal sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Predator heavy pistol. The Carnifex is a favored sidearm of mercenary leaders and Eclipse mercenary tech specialists. An expensive but powerful weapon. Its marketing materials feature a charging Krogan with the slogan "Don't you wish Carnifex was at your side?".M-5 Phalanx Heavy Pistol: Brought on the ship by Jacob Taylor, the Phalanx are rare but powerful pistols. A highly accurate and lethal sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. The M5 Phalanx is the product of the Alliance's Offensive Handgun Project that developed a close in weapon to be used on armored or shielded targets with no loss of stopping power in comparison to the soldier's assault rifle. The Phalanx enjoys a ballistics advantage even over most "hand cannons" and features an integral laser sight which is highly visible even in bright lighting conditions. Civilian variants are often purchased by colonists on planets that have particularly dangerous game animals. (Firepower Weapons Pack)Submachine GunsM-4 Shuriken Machine Pistol: A common but effective submachine gun. Fires three-round bursts, and can be pulsed for a higher rate of fire at the expense of accuracy. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers. As kinetic barriers have grown in popularity, so has the popularity of submachine guns. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine, the Shuriken Machine Pistol has a reputation for being deadly and easy to use, but is weak against armor.M-9 Tempest Submachine Gun: This submachine gun fires in long deadly bursts. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, inaccurate at long rage. Weak against armor. Upgrades the Shuriken Machine Pistol. The commonality of kinetic barriers has led to increased demand for rapid-fire weapons like the Tempest. Produced by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Eclipse mercenary band, the Tempest is an expensive but deadly addition to anyone's personal arsenal.M-12 Locust: The Kassa Fabrications Model 12 Locust is a compact submachine gun developed for the Alliance but now favored by gang enforcers and hitmen. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers. Featuring a complex recoil-reducing mechanism and high-grade autotargeting software, the Locust is a longer-range, more accurate fire than others submachine guns. (Kasumi: Stolen Memories DLC)Heavy WeaponsM-100 Grenade Launcher: A rapid fire grenade launcher used by Vorcha mercenaries in the Blood Pack group. Single shorts are able to take out multiple targets and it is useful against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. It is the first heavy weapon that Shepard acquires.ML-77 Missile Launcher: A powerful missile launcher that can be easily carried by a single person due to its collapsible design. Missiles are able to distinguish between friends and enemies, locking onto enemy targets and home in on their position.M-622 Avalanche: A weapon based on cryo-round technology. The cooling laser collapses it's ammunition into Bose-Einstein condensate, a mass of super-cooled subatomic particles capable of freezing enemies. It is effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers.M-920 Cain: Nicknamed the "Nuke Launcher," this mass effect-technology based weapon contains 25g high-explosive round slugs. By accelerating its ammo to 5km/s, the round generates an explosion matrix on impact, inflicting high damage within a large area and creating the archetypal mushroom cloud. All beings - enemies, allies, and sometimes even the user themselves - are not safe when this weapon is fired.Collector Particle Beam: A highly precise and destructive radiation beam is fired at a magnitude that is several orders higher than the amount needed to launch a high-velocity projective via a mass effect field. It is effective against shields, barriers, and armor.M-490 Blackstorm Projector: The ammo consists of a few particles of matter within a high-powered mass-increasing field, elevating them to near infinite mass and creating a powerful localized gravity well - a singularity. This draws in all enemies and objects towards its center before explosively hurling them away. This weapon is only accessible through pre-order DLC that was exclusive to certain retail stores.M-451 Firestorm: Based on the Turian "Hieras" flamethrower, the weapon fires out an anti-personnel and anti-armor flame in a deadly stream. The Turian design used low-octane hydrocarbons thickened with dentra oil, which humans reverse engineered to create a synthetic composite with almost identical properties that could be fabricated from heavy weapon fuel cells using an omni-tool. This allows the sticky fuel to be spray onto surfaces while burning at 1,600 degrees Celsius. This weapon can only be found during Zaeed Massani's loyalty quest, which is part of the Cerberus Network DLC entitled Zaeed - The Price of Revenge.Arc Projector: Uses an invisible laser to ionize the initial target which allows it to be targeted by a powerful electrical bolt, the laser then 'paints' nearby target so that the bolt can jump from one enemy to another with little resistance. This weapon is highly effective against shields and a group of enemies. The arc projector is available as free DLC through the Cerberus Network.Other CharactersAlliesThe Illusive ManThe Illusive ManThe head of Cerberus and all of its operations. He has billions of dollars of support from unknown origins and divides Cerberus into groups, each working on an important project. The Illusive Man focuses on humanities' needs first, holding crucial information for humanities survival. He is calm and collected, and is always seen in front of a dying star, smoking a cigarette. He is genetically enhanced, has cybernetically altered eyes, white wavy hair and a cold personality. He will do whatever he must to ensure humanity's survival. It is unknown whether he is the original leader of Cerberus, which splintered off the alliance, or not.Jeff "Joker" MoreauJokerThe best pilot in the Alliance, and has now re-joined Shepard under the Cerberus banner. Having a birth defect, known as "Vrolik's Syndrome" his bones are extremely fragile, breaking at the slightest of contact. However, under Cerberus, his condition seemed to be improving. Voiced by Seth Green, he is a brave, comical, and an extraordinary pilot.Kelly ChambersKelly ChambersThe ship's yeoman, serving Shepard by tracking his messages and being his personal assistant, even being able to feed his fish. Alongside this, Kelly is a psychologist, put on board to monitor the crew, and keep track of psychological profiles in times of high stress. Shepard can romance Kelly, but it isn't as deep as other relationships. It does not affect any other relationships Shepard may have concurrently.Urdnot WrexUrdnot Wrex Wrex makes a return in Mass Effect 2 (if alive) as leader of Clan Urdnot, a progressive Krogan group that seeks to unify the Krogan and make them stronger. His reforms include a no battle zone for women and children so Krogan can breed and not feel in danger. This brings clans together, and if anyone harms Clan Urdnot, the jeopardy of many females are at stake, making other clans less willing to attack.Liara T'SoniLiara T'SoniReturning from the first game, Liara is now an information broker in Illium, in search of the Shadow Broker. She has matured since the first game and is a lot more aggressive. She asks Shepard to help her find information on a Shadow Broker agent by cracking terminals, and she also takes a primary role in the Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC.New Alien SpeciesVorchaA Vorcha soldierThe Vorcha are an alien species from a relatively small planet, being in a world with limited resources, these aliens continuously fight and as a result each generation becomes continually stronger. The Vorcha that did escape their home planet did so by acting as stowaways in ships that arrived on their planet. Their main way of communication is via fighting, and are the shortest lived sentient species found, having an average life span of 20 years.DrellThe Drell are a new amphibian-humanoid species. Where humans descended from primates it seems that the Drell are descended from Amphibious life forms. Due to overpopulation on their home planet, Rahkhana, many Drell were granted asylum by the Hanar. Little is known about the Drell throughout the galaxy, but they have a history of proving very efficient killers. This stems largely from their ability to disconnect their mind and body allowing them to perform whatever actions they may need without conscious thought. Thane, a possible party member, is especially infamous. The Drell also possess two pairs of eyelids, one pair which closes vertically, a second closes horizontally.The CollectorsA CollectorA hive-minded insect race with advanced technology including beam weapons. They are the race responsible for abducting the humans from the human colonies and in using stasis pods to transport them in. They also are led by a singular leader, who can possess and control any member of the "hive" at any time. Their advanced technology and techno-organic bugs that sedate kidnap victims suggest that Collectors might have some connection with the Reapers. The Collectors are abducting entire human colonies for unknown reasons - these attacks are what Commander Shepard must investigate.EnemiesHusks:Three new types of husks have been introduced. They are called Praetorians, Scions and Abominations. The Praetorians are flying conglomerates of 30 husks that can self-detonate and shoot lasers at enemies, while the Abominations are running suicide units. Praetorians appear as boss units, presenting more of a challenge to the player than standard enemies. The next step beyond the Husks, Scions, are beings that are the fusion of 3 transformed human beings that are grafted biologically to a weapon.Mercenaries:Three major mercenary groups are encountered throughout Mass Effect 2:The Blue Suns, the largest mercenary group consisting of mostly of Turians, Humans, and Batarians started by Zaeed Massani and Vido Santiago.The Eclipse are another mercenary group that operate in tight groups and often employ Asari, Salarians, and a few Humans.The Blood Pack is a group consisting of Vorcha and Krogan that have been banned from Citadel space.Security Mechs:These mechs include LOKI, YMIR, and FENRIS mechs. LOKI mechs are common and act as a basic security guard often carrying a submachine gun or heavy pistol. YMIR mechs are massive anti-infantry countermeasures carrying mass accelerator cannons and a rocket launcher. These mechs devastate infantry on the battlefield. FENRIS mechs are anti-infantry mechs that resemble wolves or Varren. Discharging electricity with their heads they can easily take down a criminal. Along side this, they can detect weapons and narcotics with advanced sensory systems.Collectors:The main adversary throughout the game. Shepherd encounters collectors on numerous occasions fighting Drones, Assassins, and Guardians. At any time the Reaper, Harbinger, can take control of any collector via the Collector General making the possessed collector a mighty foe.Geth:While no longer one of the main enemies you face, the Geth are still present in a few missions. They deploy essentially the same variety of humanoid Geth types as in the first Mass Effect including Troopers, Rocket Troopers, Hunters, Destroyers and Primes. You also encounter the Geth Colossus and Dropship, however absent are the hoppers and the standard sized Armatures.LocationsPurgatory: A high security starship.Illium: A highly advanced Asari colony.Tuchanka: The Krogan home-world.Omega: An infamous space station inhabited by criminals and other lawless sorts; described by BioWare as the "twisted counterpart to the Citadel."Korlus: The recycling center of the universe filled with broken down ships.Migrant Fleet: The Quarian fleet used to house its population.Freedom's Progress: A human colony attacked by Collectors.Horizon: Another human colony attacked by Collectors.Haestrom: An old Quarian colony.Mnemosyne: A brown dwarf.SoundtrackThe Mass Effect 2 soundtrack was produced by Jack Wall, Sam Hulick, David Kates, and Jimmy Hinson and contains two discs with a total of 27 songs in addition to a separate nine track album of background music from loading screens and specific in-game conversations.

($7, 560 Microsoft Points for 360 or BioWare Points for PC)PlotMass Effect 2 begins shortly after the first Mass Effect, with the Normandy SR-1 investigating reported Geth sightings. Unexpectedly, the Normandy comes under attack by an unknown force in a large spaceship. Shepard orders an evacuation of the ship as they are no match for this unknown attacker but cannot escape himself, because he has to rescue Joker who refuses to abandon ship. Shepard is able to get Joker safely to an escape pod, before he is thrown into space as the Normandy is destroyed by the unknown ship. Shepard floats in space briefly, before suit damage causes his suit to depressurize. This is the apparent end for Commander Shepard, as he falls, immobile, towards the surface of a planet.Shepard's body is then picked up by an extremist group called Cerberus, an organization created to protect and advance humanity's interests in the galaxy no matter the cost. This ideal often manifests itself with ruthless behavior which causes the group to be considered more akin to a terrorist group than as a legitimate entity, especially from within the human Alliance which regards them as a severe embarrassment to their own efforts at peaceful co-existence.Cerberus begins work on rebuilding Shepard's body as part of an effort codenamed "The Lazarus Project". After two years of work, Shepard is rebuilt, although he is awakened before he can be fully tested physically and psychologically. When he awakes, Shepard finds himself in a lab woken up by Miranda Lawson who is urging him to get up and move since the station where Project Lazarus was being conducted was attacked by mechs. Shepard is able to fight his way through the station and finds Jacob, a Cerberus operative who was serving as security chief for the station. He and Shepard make their way through the station together and find Wilson, a doctor who had helped in recreating and reviving Shepard. Wilson was injured and with Shepard's help is healed enough to join them. Wilson informs them that the mechs on the station have been overridden by someone and he had tried to disarm them but was unsuccessful. This makes Jacob suspicious because Wilson should not have access to mechs since he works in medical. Wilson deflects his suspicion by blaming Miranda who he claims is conveniently missing while they are in harm's way. Jacob wants to go find Miranda but Wilson tells them to forget her and that they should just make their way to escape shuttle since there is no way she survived. They decide to go to escape but right as they open the door to the shuttle bay they find Miranda waiting there. To everyone's surprise she shoots Wilson and states that he was a traitor and that he had reprogrammed the security mechs to attack everyone. They then escape the station and Miranda takes Shepard to meet her boss, the Illusive Man.The New NormandyFollowing his resurrection, Shepard meets with the leader of Cerberus, the mysteriously named The Illusive Man. The two forge an uneasy relationship; Shepard is asked to investigate the disappearance of human colonies along the fringes of the galaxy and given the opportunity to walk away if he finds nothing. Shepard also acquires a new ship, the Normandy SR-2, which Cerberus had also constructed under extreme secrecy as well as improve upon with a number of advancements that have advanced it beyond its predecessor's original design. While it is staffed by Cerberus, Shepard discovers that the promised pilot that "he can trust" turns out to be none other than Joker who had signed on with the organization when the Alliance began to whitewash Shepard's reports on the Reapers. Using Dossiers given by the Illusive Man on "the toughest, the brightest, the deadliest allies we can find", Shepard begins assembling an elite team after discovering proof at the colony of Freedom's Progress revealing the involvement of a mysterious race known only as the Collectors, who may or may not have an alliance with the Reapers.After gathering the squad and going on various Collector-based tasks assigned by the Illusive Man such as going on the Collector ship for data or a derelict Reaper for an IFF Shepard will finally go through the Omega-4 Relay where player-made decisions made in the game will affect the outcome of this final mission. Upgrades to your ship and how loyal your crew is are integral parts to this final mission. After landing on the base Shepard splits the crew into a two man team, with one specialist going through vents. After more fighting Shepard and two other crew-mates will encounter the reason the Collectors have been abducting tens of thousands of people. A giant humanoid Reaper stares at them in the face still in a state of being built. After an epic battle against this humanoid Reaper the Collector Base can either be destroyed or kept intact for technology; however, both outcomes lead to the death of all the collectors on board.
