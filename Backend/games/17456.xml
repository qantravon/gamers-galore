The evil king Lot snatched the great      sword     excalibur in the middle of night to claim the throne to himself, as the right to rule the people falls into the hands of him who can draw the sword from the stone. Yet, the evil King Lot simply swaps the stone and    sword for a replica. As young Arthur, it is your mission to find the stolen   sword and uncover the villainous endeavours of King Lot. At your disposal is  Merlin, the mighty wizard who not only helps you in your quest, providing helpful hints, but also teaches you some impressive magical tricks.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10317">Wizard and the Princess</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1120449-arthur.jpg</image></root>
