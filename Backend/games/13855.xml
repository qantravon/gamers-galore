The grappling moves, counters and submissions can be executed by pressing 2 specific buttons together. Each fighter has his own selection of moves. The fights can be won by knockout, point advantage or tapout. Apart from acassional spurting bits of blood and painful facial expressions ( and the endurance and stamina meters at the top of the screen) there are no visible indicators of damage taken by the fighters unlike the way damage is perfectly visible in later fighting games e.g. UFC Undisputed 2010, Fight Night Round 4or Mortal Kombat.Game modes A career mode submission type fighter.
