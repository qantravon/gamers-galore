Its structure combines RPG systems of morality, conversation, loot gathering, leveling up, and crafting with third-person action combat involving weapon and and attack combinations all housed in a world of towns and dungeons cordoned-off into manageable sections.StoryKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning begins with a short scene involving the disposal of the player's corpse, followed by the player's resurrection through The Well of Souls, invented by Fomorous Hugues, a gnome.At this point in the history of the Faelands, the ten year Crystal War is taking place. The Fae, an immortal elven race split into the growth of Summer and the decay of Winter, are in turmoil. One of the Winter Fae, Gadflow, has usurped the Winter Court and now leads his army of Tuatha Deohn in the destruction of the Faelands and Amalur itself.Gadflow's army changes the very makeup of Amalur. The Tuatha have become a third faction, unbalancing the strict harmony between Summer and Winter Fae. They are unmitigated evil, given no sympathy by any character and acting as pure, immortal agressors in a seemingly hopeless war.The player's character enters this world as another agent of change. Whether the player chooses to breed chaos or order, the player is resurrected as The Fateless One. With total agency, the player is the only character unbound by the chains of destiny. Thus, the responsibility of the world falls upon the player's shoulders.FactionsWarswornA band of once-legendary warriors turned mercenaries, though they still consider themselves more. In the midst of the new war, an ancient enemy of the Warsworn returns.House of BalladsHome to the Summer Fae, is in the midst of the Telling - the cycle of ballads each Fae lives out in unending succession. The player finds a place within the House.The TravellersA famous throughout Amalur, known for their skills in trade and thievery. They have three main camps â€“ Star Camp, Moon Camp and Sun Camp.Scholia ArcanaThe Faelands' mages' guild, home to students and scholars of all things strange and magical.House of SorrowsThe home to the Winter Fae.DevelopmentThe game is set in the region around FaelandsThe team that developed Reckoning consisted of several industry veterans as well as several Bethesda alumni. The game's art was developed by Todd McFarlane and its fiction by R.A. Salvatore. Ken Rolston (Lead Designer of Oblivion) is credited as executive producer. As part of the creative process for the Amalur franchise, Salvatore developed nearly 10,000 years of history and asked the developers to pick a point in which to set the game.Earlier known as Project Mercury, development on Reckoning started at Big Huge Games while it was still owned by THQ. In 2009, Curt Schilling's 38 Studios rescued Big Huge games from its closure by THQ. On March 9, 2010, Electronic Arts announced a new publishing deal for the game and credited the close relationship between Curt Schilling and EA Sports' Peter Moore as the catalyst for the deal. The game was expected to receive strong support from EA's own BioWare team.During E3 2011 the developers showed a gameplay feature and chat that can be found here.GameplayDestinyShadowcaster Destiny: A mage/rogue hybridReckoning's base combat skill progression model is the standard warrior, rogue and mage skill trees, each of which improve combat with a given weapon set as well as provide additional active and passive skills for combat use. The weapon skills bound to each tree are the following:Might - Unlocks special abilities with longsword, greatsword, and hammers.Finesse - Unlocks special abilities with dagger, "faeblades", and longbow.Sorcery - Unlocks special abilities with staff, sceptre, and chakrams.Based on the ratio of talent points invested in these trees, the destiny system unlocks special dynamic classes that grants players additional special abilities and passive bonuses corresponding to their playstyle. These bonuses include increased damage for a certain type of attack, better movement during combat, additional health or mana regeneration, etc. Destinies are available for each combination of skill trees, including one for the jack-of-all-trades player.CombatA Fate Shift KillThe combat is based on timing and combos. This can include single-weapon timing combos as well as the inclusion of secondary weapon attacks and activated skills. Timing moves more effectively can juggle enemies, and the use of combos and skills increases a fate meter. Activating the player's fate shift begins bullet-time event and slowly drains the fate meter to zero. During this bullet-time, the player has vastly increased power and, at the conclusion of the meter or by activation, the bullet-time event ends in a button mash quick time events that provides additional experience based on the player's effectiveness.Parrying, blocking, and dodging are also core to the action. With appropriate investment in a skill tree, the player can unlock special attacks with their primary and secondary weapon out of parry, dodge, and block, and each of these avoidance/mitigation moves can leave enemies vulnerable to longer juggle combos. Certain passive bonuses found in the skill trees can cause extra damaging or utility effects during a dodge or mutate the dodge into a short-range teleport.LootPlayers can forge new items with BlacksmithingLoot is an important part of character development and improves magic and weapon fighting abilities. By and large, based on its type, loot will give bonuses to a particular play style, i.e. heavy armor benefits might and block effectiveness, medium armor is primarily intended for finesse and increases crit damage, and light armor benefits mana regeneration for sorcery-invested players.Inserting tradeskill-created gems into weapons and armor is also possible; for example, inserting a magical fire gem into a long sword will create a flaming sword. Players will also find components in the world and/or break down gear and use the resulting ingredients to create better weapons.SkillsThere are nine passive skill trees players can invest in to improve their non-combat characteristics:Alchemy - Grants players the ability to harvest reagents and create potions. More points increases the chance of successfully harvesting reagents.Blacksmithing - Allows players to repair their own weapons and equipment, as well as forge new ones. It also increases the effectiveness of repair kits.Detect Hidden - Gives players an increased chance of finding treasures and detecting traps, ambushes and secret doors. It also increases the amount of gold found while exploring.Dispelling - Allows players to dispel harmful magical spells and wards/locks without taking damage. More points in this tree increase its effectiveness.Lockpicking - Provides mastery over mechanical locks. More points increase its effectiveness.Mercantile - Improves the character's bargaining skill, allowing them to sell at higher price point while buying for less.Persuasion - Increases the character's odds of talking out of any situation.Sagecraft - Improves the character's ability to craft all sorts of gems, useful to enchant weapons and armour.Stealth - Grants players the ability to stay hidden and pickpocket others.Playable RacesAlmainThe AlmainCity and Homeland -- Port Myria, Amere ValleyRacial Bonuses - Blacksmithing (+2), Persuasion (+1) and Alchemy (+1)Noble and honorable, the Almain are humans who reject the chaotic aspects of life, always looking to input structure and ritual into everything they do.
