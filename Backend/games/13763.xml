The player controls Rockin' Rodney, a messenger, who must deliver ten demo tapes to Interdisc's head office.GameplayStreet Beat takes place in Funkytown, an open world consisting of music-themed buildings, streets, and inhabitants. The player controls Rockin' Rodney, who may travel in any direction, enter buildings, and interact with inhabitants. Additionally, Rodney holds a ghettoblaster, which he can turn on and off, change the volume, and fire music notes.Rodney's must deliver ten demo tapes to Interdisc's head office before time runs out at the end of the day.The various demo tapes are randomly scattered throughout the game world. Once Rodney locates a tape, he must use his ghetto blaster to get a specified number of inhabitants dancing before returning to Interdisc. This is accomplished with the ghettoblaster, which can fire music notes at inhabitants. Using the ghettoblaster depletes battery power, so Rocky must occassionally purchase batteries at electronic supply stores. When the batteries run out, inhabitants stop dancing, requiring Rocky to get them dancing again.A variety of enemy characters try and stop Rocky, some of which simply return him to a random part of town, and others which will end the game immediately - there are no lives. A single helpful character, "Jumpin Jack Flash" will transport Rocky to the nearest demo tape, or to Interdisc if he is already holding one. Gameplay ends if Rocky is caught by certain enemies, time lapses, or he successfully returns all ten tapes in the allotted time.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2130248-cover.jpg</image></root>
