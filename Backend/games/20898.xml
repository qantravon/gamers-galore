It was one of the first pinball machines to have an "autosave" feature that allowed you to recover a ball that drained very early in ball play. Its iconic rotating beacon lights and elaborate soundtrack made this a staple of most arcades in the late eighties and early nineties.    </description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/11819-f14tomcatflyer.jpg</image></root>
