There are 81 levels spread across 10 worlds, each filled with collectible "pills". The game features PlayStation Move support, but it is not required, as it supports normal controllers as well. A major feature of the game is players can pause  rewind time (much like in Braid) to retry any moment in the game.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20602">LittleBigPlanet</game><game id="31650">TerRover</game><game id="20716">Braid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1643332-funkytitle.jpg</image></root>
