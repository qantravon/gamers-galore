<root><id>12922</id><name>The Settlers</name><description>The Settlers is a somewhat slow-paced German-developed point-and-click title released as Serf City in the US. In Germany (although not in the rest of Europe) it was called Die Seidler. Starting with The Settlers II, it was called The Settlers in America, too.The Amiga version was released in 1993, while the MS-DOS version arrived later in 1994. The DOS version came on 3 3.5" floppy discs.A review in Amiga Format magazine cited the original versions' (or at least the DOS one's) maximum simultaneous autonomous units (on then-current hardware) at 64,000. It has 4-player multiplayer and the ability to play against computer players, or watch computer players in a full spectator mode. Players can fight with knights (upgradeable 4 times for a total of 5 levels) that also increase in strength based on their owner's wealth.The Settlers has spawned 5 sequels, as well as a DS port of The Settlers 2 (although it is just called The Settlers).</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6450">Mega lo Mania</game><game id="14139">Spore</game><game id="20580">Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution</game><game id="20779">Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization</game><game id="2846">Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings</game><game id="8546">Age of Empires III</game><game id="3380">Global Effect</game><game id="21184">Fat Princess</game><game id="10812">Beasts &amp; Bumpkins</game><game id="30965">Lord of Ultima</game><game id="16925">Anno 1602: Creation of a New World</game><game id="34703">Anno 2070</game><game id="19132">Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard</game><game id="8460">Diggles: the Myth of Fenris</game><game id="18721">Cultures</game><game id="2859">Cultures: Die Saga</game><game id="5457">Cultures: Die Abenteuerbox</game><game id="14638">Northland</game><game id="1489">8th Wonder of the World</game><game id="3009">Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile</game><game id="10942">The Nations</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="738">Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</game><game id="16757">Tropico: Paradise Island</game><game id="32326">Tropico 4</game><game id="24458">Tropico 3</game><game id="7965">Tropico 2: Pirate Cove</game><game id="11466">CivCity: Rome</game><game id="6645">Caesar III</game><game id="5652">Caesar II</game><game id="12757">Tropico</game><game id="30573">Tropico 3: Absolute Power</game><game id="4102">Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom</game><game id="36949">Majesty 2: Battles of Ardania</game><game id="17680">Pharaoh</game><game id="6210">Populous</game><game id="10562">Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods</game><game id="5211">Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon</game><game id="3769">Zeus: Master of Olympus</game><game id="3144">Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile</game><game id="625">Alien Nations</game><game id="8592">Caesar</game><game id="19170">Caesar IV</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="14823">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</game><game id="21454">Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="18490">Majesty: The Northern Expansion</game><game id="11751">Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</game><game id="29811">Majesty 2: Kingmaker</game><game id="36948">Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="10733">SimCity 3000</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/669886-settds0f.jpg</image></root>
