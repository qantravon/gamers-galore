The games uses the same technology found in the previous game in the series: Rainbow six Lockdown.  However long time fans complained the the previous game felt more like a generic run and gun  FPS, rather than the tactical shooting the series was known for. Many feel that critical hour was a response to that complaint by taking the series back to its roots of tactical action.   THE STORY John Clark, the director of  Rainbow Six, is retiring and passing the torch to    Domingo 'Ding' Chavez one of the rainbow six team leaders. (Also John Clark's son-in-law) In his departure Clark reminisces about seven of the past mission he oversaw as director Rainbow Six.  During the game the player will take on these seven mission which are taken from previous games in the series.  GAME PLAY  Critical hour returns the series to it roots by adding back a lot of the tactical elements that Lockdown scraped.  The strategic planning that many long time fans were use to is back. Weapon accuracy is affected during gameplay by such actions as running, crouching, standing still, or firing while injured. The game features more than 20 new and classic weapons.  Muilt-Player Critical hour support 16 players and features 18 new and vintage maps.  </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5722">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</game><game id="21912">Planetside: Core Combat</game><game id="9993">Halo 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2215083-box_rsch.png</image></root>
