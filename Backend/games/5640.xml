The First is the Roll mechanic which is done by pressing the Light punch and Light kick simultaneously. It temporarily renders the player's character invincible and it's useful for evading attacks. Some other basic moves include Throw and Tech Throw; the Throw is done by pressing forward or back on the D-Pad or Joystick and pressing Hard punch or Hard kick simultaneously. The Tech Throw is a cancel Throw that is done by pressing forward or back when the player is about to be thrown. The other basic moves in the game is dashing or running that the player can choose to use in the options menu. The Dash is done tapping forward or back on the Joystick or D-Pad and same thing for the run.Ratio System Before a match, the roster is broking up into four Ratio tiers; each character is place in the Ratio tiers in terms of their offense and defense. The player is given four "points" and can spend those points by picking their characters; for example, Ryu  Kyo. So the player can spent all four points by picking Ryu  Kyo and have a team of two. Or can have a team of four if the player decides to pick just the Ratio one character like Sakura  Yuri.Ratio 1: Weak Offense, Weak DefenseRatio 2: Average Offense, Average DefenseRatio 3: Strong Offense, Strong DefenseRatio 4: Strongest Offense, Strongest DefenseGroovesThe Grooves. The game features two "Grooves" that the player can select before he or she picks her characters. Each Grooves determine how the special meters are used during a fight.

The other feature of the SNK groove is when the player's health bar gets decrease at a certain point where it's blinking, the player can perform unlimited amounts of super moves. Presentation The Sakazaki stage All of the SNK characters are fully redrawn for the game and some of the Capcom characters as well. But as for the rest of the characters have not been redrawn; their sprites have been taken from where they originated -   Street Fighter Alpha and  Darkstalkers. 3D visual have been used for the projectiles attacks and other effects to give the game a unique look. The stages have special intros for all the stages - which is a bit of a nod to some of the SNK fighting games. Some of the stages have neat little effects; for example, in the Sakazaki stage, when a character gets slammed into the ground, the roof starts to slowly collapse.CharactersCapcom      Ryu (Street Fighter)     Ken Master (Street Fighter)     Sagat (Street Fighter)     Gulie (Street Fighter II)Ryu,  SNK style.
