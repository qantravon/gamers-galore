The game is set around the tournament scene and gets progressively more difficult as the player goes from venue to venue, eventually entering a global competition.GameplayThe game controls like many pool simulators (as well as several golf simulators of the time) by allowing the player to select which direction they wish to hit the cue ball in, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory, and then they must tap a button to start the power gauge and tap it again to stop at the desired level of power. The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="26">Billiards</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7803">Friday Night 3D Darts</game><game id="32822">Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend</game><game id="13437">Championship Pool</game><game id="6242">Billiards</game><game id="32848">Deep Pockets: Super Pro Pool and Billiards</game><game id="26660">Inferno Pool</game><game id="22869">Pool Hustler</game><game id="18823">The Hustle: Detroit Streets</game><game id="2371">Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker</game><game id="24770">Billiards Xciting</game><game id="26871">Hustle Kings</game><game id="25747">WSC Real 09: World Championship Snooker</game><game id="10082">Super Billiards</game><game id="24074">Midnight Pool</game><game id="12193">Trick Shot</game><game id="11351">Lunar Pool</game><game id="15071">Pocket Billiards!</game><game id="18521">Parlour Games</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362224-nes_sidepocket.jpg</image></root>
