Players can also hack off limbs and appendages, leaving enemies crippled and writhing in pain. Cooperative play and other unique online systems have also been promised.Loot!Like other action-RPGs, War in the North promises large amounts of randomly generated loot to covet, collect, and deck out your character with.Cooperative MultiplayerWar in the North will support three-player "interdependent" cooperative play.The co-op can be played via local split-screen, LAN or online. Drop in/out is featured for players, and there is always one of each race to create a balanced play and use the strengths of each. AI takes over if there is only one or two players to create the fellowship of 3.AnnouncementLoTR: War in the North was announced on March 17th, 2010 with a half minute concept trailer, and a target release date of 2011 (quarter/date unspecified).
