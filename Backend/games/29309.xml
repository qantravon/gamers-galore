In 2003, a "pilot" of sorts aired as a weeklong event on Toonami, but had a much different concept: the Immortal Grand Prix was not a race, but a combat with mechas. To coincide with the weeklong event, viewers could visit the website and take part in a browser-based action game.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28920">Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2213161-box_igpx.png</image></root>
