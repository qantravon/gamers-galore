The game takes place over 8 differently themed worlds (such as Desert, Forest etc.), sporting 10 levels each. The game is a mixture of platformer and puzzle and the player has to use his Tiny's respective ability to overcome the obstacles in each level.The four different Tinies and their special abilities are:Yellow (Fire): Shooting fireballsRed (Earth): Digging through walls etc.Green (Air): Use ropes to pull objects and swing over gaps and chasmsBlue (Water): Dive underwater and shoot bubblesThis game was re-released in the US in1994 as  Pac-in-Time, where the four different Tinies are replaced by Pac-Man who gains and loses the same abilities throughout the game, hoping that the better known Pac Man character would be more suited to ensure commercial success of the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5429">The Lost Vikings</game><game id="1446">Lemmings</game><game id="21393">Happy Tree Friends False Alarm</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/728873-23565_boxshot_1.jpg</image></root>
