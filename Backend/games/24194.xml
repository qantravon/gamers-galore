The game is split into a series of visually distinct stages that must be completed within a time limit, while navigating moving platforms, bridges, falling rocks, jumps and narrow ledges. The game also makes use of physics, meaning some of the obstacles must be overcome by breaking through them or pushing them over.Leaderboards are in place for each stage, and various items can be unlocked, including some marbles with unique powers and extra mini-games, which are unlocked using points earned by playing the main game.PC System RequirementsSupported OS: Windows速 XP (32-bit) or Windows Vista (32-bit or 64-bit)Processor: 1.5 GHz Pentium 4, AMD Athlon 1500+ or higherMemory: 512 MBGraphics: nVidia Geforce速 5600 or equivalent (must support Pixel Shader 2.0)DirectX速 Version: DirectX速 9.0 or higherSound: Direct X 9.0 compliantHard Drive: 360 MB</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9566">Marble Madness</game><game id="8047">Marble Blast Ultra</game><game id="8726">Switchball</game><game id="5122">Super Monkey Ball 2</game><game id="17195">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz</game><game id="21219">Super Monkey Ball</game><game id="6503">Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</game><game id="6991">Ballance</game><game id="16596">Hamsterball</game><game id="13585">Kororinpa: Marble Mania</game><game id="23487">Marble Saga: Kororinpa</game><game id="12577">Pac 'n Roll</game><game id="37269">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/767316-0000005812_1024x768.jpg</image></root>
