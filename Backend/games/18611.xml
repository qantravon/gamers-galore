The quicker you get there, the more money you receive. All the while, the clock is also counting down, so speed is definitely of the essence. All four original drivers are back - Axel, B.D. Joe, Gena and Gus - and the action is placed over two large cities. Mini games are also available for players to take part in.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33218">Super Taxi Driver</game><game id="17855">The Simpsons: Road Rage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/56/191445-560448_44912_front.jpg</image></root>
