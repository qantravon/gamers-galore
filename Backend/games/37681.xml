Throughout the game there are a number of puzzles the player is tasked with solving in order to progress. The player is initially given a tranquilizer gun that enables the player to incapacitate the enemy for a short time allowing the player to sprinkle them with “white water” which will restore humanity to the foe. Later in the game though the player will find a number of more lethal handgun, shotguns, etc. that will eliminate enemy characters in a much faster way than using the dart gun.Countdown Vampires has a number of familiar enemy types the most prevalant being the Vampire, while also including Werewolves, Giant Mantis creatures, giant purple Slime Monster blob beings, huge mutant Frog-like monster, and the ever present early on in the game vampire Bats.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4312">Silent Hill</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/139401/2145352-cover.jpg</image></root>
