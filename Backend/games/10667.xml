Unlike the first two games in the Family Trainer series, Athletic World and World Track Meet, this game is intended solely for exercise rather than any competitive elements.To play the game, the player must follow the on-screen commands to dance like the figure shown. Each type of exercise always starts with a basic stretching and warm-up routine before launching into various types of aerobic exercise. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20629">Dance Dance Revolution UNIVERSE 3</game><game id="18232">Track &amp; Field</game><game id="39303">Family Trainer Series 4: Jogging Race</game><game id="40010">Family Trainer: Fuuun!
