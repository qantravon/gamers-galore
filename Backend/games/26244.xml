Experience being a negatively buoyant jellyfish who wants nothing more than for the sweet warm sun to kiss his hydrostatic skeleton. Use flow controls to glide through the ocean's depths as you ascend in this liquid platformer. Maintain your ascent by gathering melodious nutrient bubbles as you play, chaining collisions to build up aurally stimulating combos.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/967967-xboxboxart__12_.jpg</image></root>
