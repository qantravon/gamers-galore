Not yet available) DevelopmentChanging FocusNeverwinter was announced as a coop game in August of 2010. Atari owned Cryptic Studios at the time and was planning on releasing Neverwinter in 2011 as part of a greater media campaign for Neverwinter-based products. This idea was shelved when Atari sold Cryptic Studios to Perfect World Entertainment in May, 2011. The game was shown at E3 2011, but shortly thereafter began its transformation from coop RPG to free-to-play MMO. It was delayed multiple times by Perfect World, ultimately pushing it into mid-2013.BetaNeverwinter held several closed beta weekends beginning in February 2013. Players were phased in based on their level of purchase (into founders packs), other Perfect World games they own, and PAX attendance keys. The open beta began Apr. 30, 2013. As of the open beta, player accounts will not be wiped and the game is essentially released.System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7 or 8CPU: Dual-core 2.0GHz CPURAM: 1GBGPU: 128MB, GeForce 6800 or ATI Radeon X850 or higher, Shader Model 2.0Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound chip or onboard audioInternet: Broadband Internet Connection RequiredRecommended:OS: Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7 or 8CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHzRAM: 2GBGPU: 512MB, GeForce 8800 or ATI Radeon HD 2900GT, Shader Model 2.0Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound chip or onboard audioInternet: Broadband Internet Connection Required</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png</image></root>
