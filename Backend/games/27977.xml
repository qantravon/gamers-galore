It heavily focuses on Mechanized Combat, on a grand scale with you and your teammates. Everything is going to be clustered on one server, and the map is going to feature dynamic terraforming. So it will be up to the player to decide, whether to keep it a barren world, or build it into a thriving planet with lush environments.  The game as of now is in it's Alpha stages, and most of the gameplay that has been seen will have upgraded visuals, and better explosion effects. No announcements dates have come out yet, but we are expecting to here something soon. The developers are in touch with their community, and take a lot of feedback in and implement it into their MMO, so there is a good connection of communication there. </description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="27284">MechWarrior Online</game><game id="19719">Chromehounds</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/32465/1119294-senkastrike_800x600.jpg</image></root>
