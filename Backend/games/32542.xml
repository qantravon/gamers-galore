With the help of the Bit.Trip developers, it was brought to WiiWare the following year.GameplayOn both versions of the game, the player steers a white line through a tunnel by tilting the iPhone/Wii Remote. Much like other music/rhythm games, the player will have to press a button (or the touch screen) at certain moments in order to score points. Hitting the walls of the tunnel will cause the player to lose points. Crash into the walls too many times and the player will fail the level.MusicSounding somewhat similar to chiptune, the original dubstep/UK Bass score of the game was produced by MTA Records' London-based duo "16bit".</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1845326-lilt_line.jpg</image></root>
