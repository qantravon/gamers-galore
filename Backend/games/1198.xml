That is all there is to the game, you simply have to move left right (which actually scrolls the screen, the gun turret stays centered on the screen) and shoot the crabs. Moving the turret also moves any shots you have fired so it is possible to steer shots in to crabs. You lose a life if any of the green goo the crabs fire at you hits the turret.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1363436-lunacrabs_loading.gif</image></root>
