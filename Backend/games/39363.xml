<root><id>39363</id><name>Kinect Party</name><description>OverviewKinect Party is a Kinect-centric casual activity collection developed by Double Fine and published by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on December 17, 2012. It is the followup to Double Fine Happy Action Theater (and its replacement, adding all 18 activities from the original), allowing up to six people at a time (with seamless joining in and out of the play area) to participate in 36 crazy activities (known as "channels") ranging from playing around in a river of lava to dancing around in a faux-dubstep video.While the original game's activities and aesthetic were reminiscent of '20s and '30s theater, the sequel's aesthetic is set in the lights and colors of a '60s TV sound stage.For the 2012 Xbox 360 "Countdown to the Holidays" promotion, Microsoft has released the full unlock for the game for free until December 31, 2012. After that, it was made 800 msp ($10), with a 50% discount for owners of Double Fine Happy Action Theater.Because of Double Fine's awesome relationship with the folks at Giant Bomb, the game was officially announced in a live "Quick Look EX". Parts of the QLEX were featured in the game's promotional material. The game also features assets (mainly costume parts) from other franchises (such as Minecraft).</description><genres><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2368429-box_kparty.png</image></root>
