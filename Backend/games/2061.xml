<root><id>2061</id><name>Halloween</name><description>The game Halloween is based of the popular horror film of the same  name. You play as the babysitter trying to rescue the little children  from the serial killer Michael Myers who comes at you as well as the  children and chases you through a house with his knife. When he appears on screen you hear a Atari  rendition of the Halloween theme. If he comes within physical contact of the player or one of the children, their head disappears leaving blood spurting out while the decapitated person runs around the room in shock. An interesting fact is that when Wizard Video Games was getting rid of their inventory, they just placed duct tape over the top of the game cartridge and written on it was "Halloween" to cut printing costs. The tittle was written in orange sharpie, to try and add to the 'spookiness' of the game. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21482">Friday the 13th</game><game id="11827">A Nightmare on Elm Street</game><game id="2292">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2218/208711-halloween.jpg</image></root>
