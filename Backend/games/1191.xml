Successfully defeating the jiang shi reduces it to flames and the player receives the gratitude of the house's owner, occasionally with the added benefit of being allowed to rest there and regain health. After defeating a certain number of regular jiang shi, a special boss version must be fought in a nearby cave before moving onto the next town.The player can also acquire red orbs from fallen foes, which can then be spent in training halls to acquire new moves. Inexplicably, the player must answer several simple trivia questions before being allowed to train.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39605">Kyonshiizu 2</game><game id="40564">Family Trainer: Rairai Kyonshizu</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/233604-phantom_fighter.jpg</image></root>
