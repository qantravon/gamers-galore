It is a side scroller, but don't let that fool you, because the game is pretty messed up.The game is told in flashback after a young girl is sent to a mental hospital. Throughout the game we slowly learn that the girl believes that an angel has ordered her to kill off all three of her dad's girlfriends or really any one he's ever slept with. This plays out in the various levels in which each boss is an undead fetus. We are not making this up.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/70096/2426962-161667_237792_lgboxartjpg_620x.jpg</image></root>
