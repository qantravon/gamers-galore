Risa herself is even dressed like Little Red Riding Hood on the box art.The game has a fairly standard NES adventure game set-up of having to use menus to move around and choose who or what to interact with. A slight difference in the usual format is that the player character is visible (along with Risa) in the graphics window, which would normally be in first-person.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21716">Tokimeki Memorial</game><game id="37810">Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</game><game id="4555">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</game><game id="18052">Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken</game><game id="40636">Hikari Genji Roller Panic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2344196-risa_no_yosei_densetsu.jpg</image></root>
