<root><id>1286</id><name>Azada</name><description>Azada is a collection of puzzle mini games tied to a limited story.  The object is tp fill the 10 puzzle books missing pages.   Each book is missing nine pages.  Each page is it's own unique puzzle.  You must complete the books in order.  And there is a time limit for each book.  Each book gets you one step closer to unlocking the puzzle master, and when you do the game abruptly ends.  The puzzles are neither new or compelling, and the story  isn't climatic.  However the game is well polished, has little to no load times, and has a unique artistic direction.  </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7303/607114-azada_title.jpg</image></root>
