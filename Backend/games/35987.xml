Very much like in Portal, the main character wields a unique weapon, only this one doesn't create portals out of thin air, but is instead able to manipulate the environment around her by altering the laws of physics-- that's right, the laws of physics. The player is able to spawn small pockets of gravity and anti-gravity that will in turn affect its surroundings, either by pulling object towards them (gravity) or pushing them away (anti-gravity). The player can and should also use these abilities to change the length of their jumps in order to overcome certain obstacles.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP/Vista/7Processor: 1.5GhzMemory: 512MbHard Disk Space: 50MbVideo Card: 128 MB Graphics Card that supports Shader Model 1.1DirectXÂ®: 9.0c</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21170">Portal</game><game id="20716">Braid</game><game id="36999">Pid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/2181810-defygravityextended.jpg</image></root>
