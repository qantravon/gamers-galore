With the space button these blocks are stored on five fields at the ground. The blocks do not have unlimited space on the ground, they need to disappear. Happening by one equivalent blocks, it gives seven different colours, at horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows together stacks. At least three blocks must placed in this way together. This is how they finally disappear and roam for new make.  For combinations of more than three blocks one receives still points of bonus. KLIX is divided into innumerable level, each level has a certain task which needs to be solved. At the beginning you must reduce only ten combinations for example, later it must be ten diagonal rows. The further one comes into KLIX the task become harder and the conveyor gets faster.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31384">Klix 2</game><game id="16455">Klax</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/94457/1381884-corel032.jpg</image></root>
