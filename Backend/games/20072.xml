Making sure to keep hunger, thirst, disease and fatigue down is instrumental to the player character's survival. They can also communicate with other members of their own tribe to ask for trade and assistance, complete missions given by the tribe elder as well as fight opponents with sharpened flint (which the player must create in a carving mini-game) which are also used to hunt game animals for food.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17463">The Sims</game></similar_games><image>NONE</image></root>
