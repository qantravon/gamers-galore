The demon is wrecking havoc across various points in history and the player, as the boy's spirit, has to try and stop it. The player has at their disposal the unique ability to possess various animals and people as well as the usual set of menu-driven commands common to Famicom adventure games.Time Twist was created by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves, using much of the same staff that worked on the two Famicom Mukashi Bunashi (Famicom Fairy Tale) games: Shin Onigashima (New Oni Island) and Yuyuuki (Brave Spirits).Time Twist would also be the very last game developed by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System peripheral and was also the last packaged game to be sold for the device. Later games for the peripheral would be sold entirely through the Disk Writer service. Time Twist itself would eventually be sold via the Disk Writer service as well, as packaged versions were in short supply and have since become something of a collector's item as a result. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34684">Famicom Mukashi Banashi: Shin Onigashima</game><game id="37545">Famicom Mukashi Banashi: Yuyuki</game><game id="5758">Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shoujo</game><game id="26613">Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Koukeisha</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/151939/2165617-time_twist_boxarts.png</image></root>
