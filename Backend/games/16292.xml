In order to escape from the flooding submarine two keys on every floor must be collected. Once the two keys have been collected the next floor may be accessed. There are also Torpedoes which will fly back and forth, and if hit by the torpedoes, time will be lost and the floor may potentially flood before the next floor is available.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/633901-b_airlock_front.jpg</image></root>
