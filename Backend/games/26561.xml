<root><id>26561</id><name>Rygar</name><description>Gameplay Rygar features a series of levels where the player must reach the end of the stage before the time limit runs out.  The player is armed with a large disc weapon which is attached to the character's wrist by a short chain.  The weapon can be upgraded to a larger version during the game. The game is notable in that despite having a time limit, the game does not automatically end when the timer expires.  Instead, a demonic monster appears that will actively pursue (and usually kill) the player as they race for the exit.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16098">Black Tiger</game><game id="2057">Karnov</game><game id="1257">Blaster Master</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg</image></root>
