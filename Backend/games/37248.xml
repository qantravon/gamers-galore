In Warlock, the players will chose from several factions, of both human and fantasy origins, such as orc tribes or hordes of undead, and set out to conquer the world and defeat the other rulers. The game features a strong spellcasting system, including the ability to combine spells into more powerful and/or different versions. The players will have to prove their worth both in managing the empire and its cities as well as defeating the other mages and enemies on the battlefields.System RequirementsMinimum:OS: Windows Vista, Windows 7Processor: Dual Core CPUMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce GT240 512Mb or comparableDirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 4 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compatibleRecommended:OS: Windows 7Processor: Quad Core CPUMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce GTX460 1Gb or comparableDirectX®: 9.0cHard Drive: 4 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21978">Master of Magic</game><game id="18414">Age of Wonders</game><game id="18279">Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic</game><game id="15976">Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne</game><game id="24369">Elemental: War of Magic</game><game id="3681">Lords of Magic</game><game id="37508">Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings</game><game id="30057">Sid Meier's Civilization V</game><game id="41503">Age of Wonders III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2188531-box_wlmota.png</image></root>
