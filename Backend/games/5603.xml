The player has 30 days to collect treasures from around the world with the help of Huey, Dewey and Louie. Launchpad McQuack also joins them on the adventure.The game has several types of gameplay, among which is mountain-climbing with a rope, taking pictures of rare animals, and cave exploring, all based on classic arcade game types. It can probably be regarded as a lost relic in the Disney canon of games, as its existence is rarely referenced by anyone as the NES game is held in such high regard.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4668">Donald Duck's Playground</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3715/654194-575296_34257_front.jpg</image></root>
