<root><id>38916</id><name>Ravenskull</name><description>OverviewRavenskull was the first commercially available game developed by Martin Edmondson and Nicholas Chamberlain, who founded what is today Ubisoft Reflections. Gameplay involves entering Baron Streig's Castle Ravenskull and defending the land of Austberg from monsters, ultimately retrieving the silver crucifix, an artifact that was stolen by Baron Streig and split into four different pieces found on four different levels throughout the game. The player chooses one of four different classes: the adventurer, the elf, the warrior, and the wizard. The choice in class changes the player's sprite as well as the different treasures uncovered throughout the game.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/160135/2258192-ravenskullfrontcover.jpg</image></root>
