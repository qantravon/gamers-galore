<root><id>39593</id><name>Knock-Knock</name><description>OverviewKnock-Knock is an horror themed adventure game developed and published by Ice Pick Lodge. The game has been devised by the developers from 19 mysterious files, sent to them by an unknown figure via email; they were asked to finish the project using the information stored in these files, with the only catch that they had to include everything in the files, but designing it was entirely up to them.The aim of the game is to play what is essentially a game of hide and seek, but against unusual 'Guests' who have been visiting the house of a hermit - the player character. The aim of the game is to merely survive the night with your sanity intact. Beyond surviving, the "Lodger" as he's called in game, can also collect pages from his diary. These pages reveal certain elements of story and hints for the game's mechanics, but some of these notes also include strange rituals that refer to themselves as games which result in welcoming and communing with "guests". Through these cryptic notes and the Lodger's own monologues the player can try to deduce what is going on but the constant theme of insanity results in considerations for an unreliable narrator.System RequirementsPCMinimumOS: Windows XP or laterGraphics: GPU that supports shader model 2.0Hard Drive: 700 MB available spaceMacMinimumOS: Mac OS X 10.5 or laterGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000Hard Drive: 700 MB available spaceRecommendedGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000LinuxMinimumOS: Ubuntu 10.10 or laterGraphics: GPU that supports shader model 2.0Hard Drive: 700 MB available space</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="43323">Neverending Nightmares</game><game id="37794">Lone Survivor</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117226/2305793-3ee2fee62a00830315dccabd807612e7_large.jpg</image></root>
