Billed as "the next chapter" in the series by CEO Sergiy Grygorovych the game will be using a new multi-platform engine that is being built from the ground up by the design team. No other details were given at the time of the announcement. The engine used to make the game was an updated version of X-Ray.CancellationOn December 9th it was reported on UkraNews that GSC Game World would be closing down. The unofficial reason for this is that Sergei Grigorovich founder and CEO of the company is unhappy with the development progress of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.The claim was later refuted on the developer's official twitter page, but that response was later taken down. Again, on the official twitter page, it's simply said "We will do our best to continue. However, at this moment, nothing is certain."On April 25th, 2012 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was confirmed cancelled on the developers official Facebook page: link </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20504">Fallout 3</game><game id="20672">Rage</game><game id="20964">Metro 2033</game><game id="8197">Boiling Point: Road to Hell</game><game id="25933">Fallout: New Vegas</game><game id="38078">The Dead Linger</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164160/2280685-s2.jpg</image></root>
