Victory is the first of only three machines to use a photo realistic Vitrigraph mylar. This Vitrigraph Mylar is an overlay that was used on the play field. Most pinball machines at the time used a silk screen on the play field instead. The process of using a Vitrigraph instead of silk screen was only used by Gottlieb and only on Victory,   Diamond Lady, and  TX-Sector.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35184">Indianapolis 500</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1786516-v3.jpg</image></root>
