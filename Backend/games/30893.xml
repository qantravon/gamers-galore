Each circle can contain six wedges, and once a circle is completed, the pieces are cleared and the circle becomes open again. Circles may completed with any colored wedge (so long as the orientation of the wedge fits within the open slots of the circle), but more points are awarded for circles completed with wedges all of the same color (additional lives are granted in this way as well). If a wedge is not placed into a circle before the timer runs out, or if no circle has an open slot based on the orientation of the wedge, a life is lost. As the game progresses, the timer ticks down much faster until it becomes almost instant. Various power-ups may appear as well for consecutive completed circles including a Nuke, which clears the board entirely, and a score multiplier.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="31232">Fractal: Make Blooms Not War</game><game id="33630">Astronut</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/68003/1338762-frenzic.png</image></root>
