Two hundred years have passed since your last visit and much has changed since then. An unknown being who calls himself the Guardian has appeared and is forcing everyone to bow to his whims. In addition magic doesn't work as it should, it seems that all of the mages have gone insane, and quiet towns are being terrorized with ritualized murders. It is unclear what is happening, but initial signs point to some kind of organization called the Fellowship. It is up to you to unravel the mystery and find out what is really going on in Britannia.</description><genres><genre>Role-Playing</genre></genres><image /></root>
