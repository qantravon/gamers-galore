Unlike its predecessor, which was a straightforward scrolling shooter, The Maze of Galious is an open action adventure game with some RPG elements, much like modern Metroidvania games.PlotKidnapping Aphrodite in Knightmare was actually a diversion by an evil priest Galious. While Popolon was away saving her Galious took over the Castle Greek and kidnapped their yet unborn baby Pampas. Popolon and Aphrodite must defeat Galious and his demons to free their castle and rescue Pampas.NES VersionNES version of the game was released only in Japan, with a slightly different name Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious. Though the main concept is same, the game is significantly different from MSX version, most notably the level design.PC and WII RemakeA remake for the PC was released in 2002 by BrainGames as a free download. There was nothing added to the core gameplay and level design of the original MSX version, but an option to save to one of the function keys instead of writing down a password became available. The ability to change the graphical tiles and music on the fly was also added via the F10 or 9 key and F11 or 0 key.In 2010 the game became also available on the WII as a homebrew game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22517">La-Mulana</game><game id="4068">Legacy of the Wizard</game><game id="36869">UnEpic</game><game id="39617">Youkai Yashiki</game><game id="42956">Lutter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/126208/1870048-the_maze_of_galious__konami__front.jpg</image></root>
