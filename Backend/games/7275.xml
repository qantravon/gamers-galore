<root><id>7275</id><name>TLL: Tornado Low Level</name><description>TLL was a game from   Costa Panayi that took the unique 3d layered look developed in  Android Two and put a new form of game in it. TLL stood for Tornado Low Level and was based on the Tornado aircraft which was used by air forces in Europe to perform low level attacks. Â The game would start by placing targets randomly in the world and required you to fly the plane from the airfield to the various targets. The targets were only eliminated if you flew at a very low level over them and more points were scored the lower you flew. The aircraft also required refueling if you took too long which was achieved by landing back at the airfield you started at. True to the tornado aircraft you could also sweep the wings backwards and forwards to either fly faster or slower which helped get places quickly or to slow down to get a target.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9304">Cyclone</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1345381-t.l.l._gameplay.gif</image></root>
