<root><id>39783</id><name>Doremiko</name><description>OverviewDoremiko (which means nothing in Japanese; rather, it's a play on the "do-re-mi" scales) is music creation software created by Konami that joins earlier efforts from Musical Plan such as Family Composer in creating software for the Famicom that allows users to compose their own musical pieces. The game includes several synthesizer elements that allow players to change between different instruments (or at least electronic equivalents) as well as including a few pre-generated tracks to get budding maestros started.The game was considerably more expensive than other FDS games, largely because it came with its own keyboard peripheral that could interact with the game. Being a Konami product, there's a few references to their other games, such as one of the built-in tracks being a medley of Gradius tunes and an appearance by that series' Vic Viper starfighter.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39669">Family Composer</game><game id="21427">Korg DS-10</game><game id="42255">Ikinari Musician</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2323351-doremiko_front.jpg</image></root>
