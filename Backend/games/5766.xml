As a fireman's it's your job to catch these babies before they hit the ground. You and your colleague have arrived at the scene with - of all things - a trampoline. Using it, you must bounce the babies into the ambulance which is parked some distance away.The game gives you five lives. Whenever a baby hits the ground, you lose a life. The babies come in waves; the further you get into the game, the more babies are thrown out of the apartment building. How many can you save before you run out of lives?</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81415/1280619-bouncing_babies.gif</image></root>
