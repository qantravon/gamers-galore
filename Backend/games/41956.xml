<root><id>41956</id><name>Race â€“ The Official WTCC Game</name><description>The game is essentially a simulator, and when set to the highest difficulty, it produces a highly demanding and challenging game pace. However, the game can be made easier by togging on various aids, like traction control, anti-lock braking system and such. Moreover, the game does demand players to drive as real world race drivers will do, like the usage of braking to prevent wheels from locking up, and braking the car to an appropriate speed before turning into a corner. An attempt of "drifting" through the corner will usually cause the car to flip.</description><genres><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/6460-1.jpg</image></root>
