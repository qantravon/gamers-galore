Beyond the impressive roster of 15 weapons (shotguns, rocket launchers, etc) and 25 gadgets (jetpacks, etc), Vectorman's big gimmick was in its physics engine. Enemy robots and even parts of the world were destructible, accompanied by lots of shiny, bouncing chunks. Some areas could be destroyed to create cover points or bridges to navigate the game. A.I. was also a touted feature with non-player characters going about their robo-lives and enemy soldiers that "adapt to their environment, take cover when attacked and use advanced strategic tactics to create deep, varied combat".    </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1101558-vectorman_1.jpg</image></root>
