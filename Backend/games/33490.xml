When the blinds are raised all the way, a sunset is visible through the window. It wasn't intended for commercial release at the time of its creation, but has since been released on the Xbox 360's Game Room and some game compilations as a historical novelty.After a group of ex-Atari employees formed Activision, Atari threatened to sue the new company for stealing programming techniques, including the "venetian blinds" technique; a programming technique used in Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the standard six.When Atari's lawyers questioned Activision about this stolen technique, David Crane prepared and showed them this demo as a joke, and asked, "Is this what you guys are referring to?" Atari was not amused and went ahead with the lawsuit, which they subsequently lost.The sunset displayed in Venetian Blinds was later used as a part of the background in Barnstorming.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/36406/1662821-s_venetianblinds_3.png</image></root>
