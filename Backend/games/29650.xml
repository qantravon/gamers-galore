The main difference between Nier Replicant and Gestalt is the age of the main character and his relationship to the character Yonah. In Gestalt, Nier is an older man who tries to save his daughter Yonah from a mysterious illness. In Replicant, Nier appears signficantly younger, and Yonah is his younger sister.Beyond these key differences, Nier Replicant is almost identical to Gestalt in both story and gameplay. Replicant was not released for international audiences and at this point remains exclusive to Japan. However, downloadable content released for Gestalt features gameplay set in Nier's youth that uses his younger character design from Replicant.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26596">Nier</game><game id="31242">El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron</game><game id="26645">Trinity: Souls of Zill O'll</game><game id="32906">Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/65194/1716346-nier_replicant_jaquette_japonaise.jpg</image></root>
