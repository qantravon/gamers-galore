The game takes place in a series of small windowsills, each requiring some sort of dragging and clicking to produce a tiny white box. This item must then be inserted into a socket above a door on the right-hand side of the screen, unlocking the door and allowing the locomotive to proceed.The artwork, animation and code were done by Patrick Smith.System RequirementsPCOS: Windows XP/VistaProcessor: 2 GHz Pentium M or higherMemory: 256 MB RamGraphics: No special requirementsHard Drive: 8 MB Free spaceSound: No special requirementsMacComputer: Intel Mac, OS X 10.5 or laterHard Drive: 8MB of disk spacePeripherals: Mouse recommended (one button is fine)Useful linkshttp://smithpix.net/http://windosill.com/soundCredits.html</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19124">Full Pipe</game><game id="12860">Samorost</game><game id="35011">Botanicula</game><game id="30604">Hamlet or the last game without MMORPG elements, shaders, and product placement</game><game id="20343">Samorost 2</game><game id="23648">Machinarium</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/41508/1183622-windosill.png</image></root>
