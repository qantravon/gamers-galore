However, this compatability issue can be overcome by using this guide : http://forum.sacred2.com/showthread.php?t=67312, which allows the US \ Steam version of Sacred 2 to be patched with the UK version of Ice and Blood.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1119">Diablo II</game><game id="8638">Titan Quest</game><game id="2059">Dungeon Siege</game><game id="33494">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Daggerdale</game><game id="31832">Konung III: Ties of the Dynasty</game><game id="8590">Dawn of Magic</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14741/1152593-s2ib.jpg</image></root>
