This version of Gauntlet IV is absolutely awesome! Terrific additions have been made like a lengthy Quest mode and a blood-thirsty battle mode for a bunch of your friends. This game may get my vote as having the best music heard on the Genesis. It's orchestrated perfectly. And with the addition of being able to use the Sega Tap and EA's Four Way Play, the options are limitless".</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5985">Diablo</game><game id="4719">Alien Breed</game><game id="7849">Dungeon Explorer</game><game id="8428">Arcus Odyssey</game><game id="28218">Dungeon Explorer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5224/492437-0001.png</image></root>
