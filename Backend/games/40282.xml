<root><id>40282</id><name>Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne</name><description>OverviewJourney to the Center of Hawkthorne was originally featured in the three-part season 3 finale of Community. The episode, "Digital Estate Planning", took place in a videogame Pierce's father created, as a way of determining who received his inheritance. Fans immediately latched onto the idea of actually playing Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne. A playable version of the game was made available at the Six Seasons and A Movie Art Show. Development continues and new versions of the game are consistently released via the website http://projecthawkthorne.com/. Development is coordinated through the many Community fans via the subreddit r/hawkthorne.Episode ReferencesEnvironmental GagsFire alarms fall off when pulled.
