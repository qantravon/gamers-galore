This included the famous Planet of the Apes Binome featured in a cutscene.  The story of the game is considered canon of the series and takes place halfway through the second season of the series.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2210198-box_reboot.png</image></root>
