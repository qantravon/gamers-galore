A very popular game which received high review scores for its solid gameplay, great graphics and jaunty soundtrack.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10026/568379-creatures__thalamus_.jpg</image></root>
