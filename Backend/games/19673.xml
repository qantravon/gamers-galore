The goal is to fight through enemies until they drop a floor key, which is used to unlock the door leading to the next floor.The player can attack by swinging his sword and block enemy attacks with his shield. Both actions build up the power gauge, but also cause the food gauge to drain faster. Player's and enemies' attack strength is determined by rolling dice.Defeated enemies regularly drop items that can be picked up and equipped in one of four available slots. The player starts with one healing potion upon entering a dungeon.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2268093-untitledc.png</image></root>
