The player first purchases blueprints of the house where the soon-to-be stolen object is kept. Then several specialists can be hired, that disable     alarms,    open locks or drive the getaway car. The planning stage allows the player to set way points, actions and the times at which the actions should take place. For example the alarm specialist needs 2 minutes to disable the alarm for a certain display. After 2 minutes, the   lock picking master opens the display and takes the  loot.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17716">Heist</game><game id="20853">Hei$t</game><game id="4175">The Clue!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1120208-tnthey_stole_a_million.jpg</image></root>
