In the game's attract mode, players see the statement: "The President has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?"Players, as protagonists Blade and Stryker (who were named unironically), can use knives and nunchaku to fight their way through levels, collecting power-ups along the way in the form of soda to refill lost life or clocks to add time.At the end of each level is a boss character.Stage NameDescriptionStage 1: The streets of a cityThe boss is Karnov.Stage 2: On top of a speeding "Dudes" truckThe boss is a clawed ninja named "Nenail".Stage 3: The sewersAt this point in the Famicom version of the game, the bosses begin to threaten the player before the beginning of the stage. The boss is a ninja named "Hanzo", a master of creating illusion copies of himself.Stage 4: A forestThe boss is a gigantic man named "Animal", who is decidedly un-ninja-like.Stage 5: A trainKarnov appears again in this stage, recoloured blue in the NES/Famicom version. Amusingly, he also turns blue in the Karnov game when he has been hit once.The boss is a warrior named "Killer Joe" who wields a claw on the end of a chain.Stage 6: CavesThe boss is Kon Bousai.Stage 7: The Dragon Ninja's HQAll of the earlier bosses are fought a second time, with the finale being against the leader of the Dragon Ninja, coincidentally called "Dragon Ninja" himself, on a helicopter.
