Zombies!The gameplay is simplistic, consisting of only side-to-side movement using the D-pad, and point shooting using the touch screen controls. The controlled character will automatically move forward, and stop at certain instances. The point of the game is to dodge the attacks of the zombies (both melee and projectiles) and to destroy them in order to advance. There are crates that can be opened for ammo or special weapons (eg, shotgun). However, special weapons have limited ammo. There is also a melee attack available, triggered by swiping the stylus sideways in front of the character when zombies are nearby. Reloading is performed by tapping the weapon icon on the right side of the screen.</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3819">Zombie Shooter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2136550-box_lrrhzbbq.png</image></root>
