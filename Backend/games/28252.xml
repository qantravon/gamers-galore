Completing a goal awards you a trophy which can be viewed in your trophy case. There are three for each lever: bronze, silver, and gold.  Ramps Ramp Champ comes with four ramps, and four more ramps can be downloaded in packs of two for 99¢.   Included:Clown TownBreakwater BaySpace SwarmThe Icon Garden  Downloadable:  Ninja AttackTiki IslandMolar MadnessHappy Place</description><genres><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33630">Astronut</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1086/1144787-ramp_champ__iphone__512x512.png</image></root>
