While all the games only require one Move controller, many of the games allow the player to use a 2nd Move wand to "dual wield" for additional control.  Players can initially choose from 10 different characters across all six events, with additional characters becoming available by completing certain events.Games     Disc Golf     Gladiator Duel       Archery      Beach VolleyballBocce        Table Tennis Modes Free Play Mode: Casual matches for single and multiple players.Challenge Mode: Try for the best scores in game specific challenge sets. Champion Cup Mode:  Compete in the bronze, silver, and gold cups to  unlock prizes. Each Cup has 10 matches, and when those 10 are completed, it opens up the next Cup.

If a player can beat that opponent, that new character is then a selectable character for all of the other sports.  Bosses SportBoss Disc GolfUmrog - A large, bearded caveman Gladiator DuelTitus Maximus  - A medieval executioner ArcheryMorgrimm - A ranger Beach VolleyballVivian Lockhart - A pirate BocceFrankie - A fat Italian guy Table TennisAce 8000 - A robot</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="21098">Wii Sports Resort</game><game id="31703">Kinect Sports</game><game id="29821">Racquet Sports</game><game id="20632">Deca Sports</game><game id="25861">Deca Sports 2</game><game id="31704">Kinect Adventures!</game><game id="24396">Grand Slam Tennis</game><game id="38502">Sports Champions 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1886625-box_schampions.png</image></root>
