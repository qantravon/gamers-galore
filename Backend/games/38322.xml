Dracula, his minion Igor and the unlikely supporter Van Helsing join forces and track down the Queen to try and rescue Mina. The game is a hidden-object / puzzle hybrid. The player either has to use objects to interact with the environment (use knife to open sea shell etc.) or find specific objects in a cluttered environment. The game is high-resolution graphics, albeit semi-static screen with only limited animations. There are two difficulty modes available, easy and hard, varying in number of available hints etc.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/2205512-dracula_love_kills_feature.jpg</image></root>
