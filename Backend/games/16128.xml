There were several waves for each stage that consisted of dodging asteroid fields, shooting incoming ships and blowing up mines. There was also a slight 3D effect with a scrolling star field and sprites that got larger as they moved towards you.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1364674-adastra3.jpg</image></root>
