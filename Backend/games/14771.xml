<root><id>14771</id><name>Virtual Chess 64</name><description>Virtual Chess 64, is the first and only Chess game released for the N64. Their are two main modes of play 2D and 3D. In 2D mode the game is simply a traditional chess game viewed from a top down perspective. The 3D mode however lets the player view the chess board from any angle they see fit, and also includes battle animations that play whenever a piece gets captured. (These can also be turned off if they get too annoying.)</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19195">Chessmaster 10th Edition</game><game id="20077">Battle Chess</game><game id="4342">Online Chess Kingdoms</game><game id="16214">The Fidelity Ultimate Chess Challenge</game><game id="20493">Chessmaster: The Art of Learning</game><game id="8517">Star Wars Chess</game><game id="11752">The Chessmaster</game><game id="808">Chess</game><game id="15086">Chessmaster 6000</game><game id="2357">Chessmaster 8000</game><game id="3036">Archon: The Light and the Dark</game><game id="11488">Learn To Play Chess with Fritz &amp; Chesster</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10831/468638-199208_28084_front.jpg</image></root>
