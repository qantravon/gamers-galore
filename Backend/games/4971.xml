<root><id>4971</id><name>Total Annihilation: Battle Tactics</name><description>OverviewTotal Annihilation: Battle Tactics followed shortly after the first expansion pack, The Core Contingency, adding 100 new single-player missions of varying lengths. These missions are the only product-exclusive additions, though the pack does also contain four new units that were released by Cavedog for download after the release of the first expansion pack. These units include mobile flak platforms and EMP missile structures for both sides. Finally, new keyboard shortcuts are included, though these were introduced in patches.The missions included in Battle Tactics differ from those in the previous games in that they focus on tactical problems instead of the standard base-building and search-and-destroy formula. The Battle Tactics missions often supply players with a small group of units with which to wage battle, sometimes not even giving players a Commander or any other base-building unit. These missions are divided up by expected play time, ranging from very short to very long, and encompass all of the difficulty levels.
