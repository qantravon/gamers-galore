Since then, the game was refocused into a WiIWare title with a stronger focus on multiplayer mayhem. It was released only in Japan.After defeating smaller enemies, they queue up behind the player character and can be used in "line attacks" to hit stronger enemies in various ways (the latter part is conspicuously similar to some of the early combat seen in Platinum Games' Wii U exclusive debut, Project P-100). The type of attack depends on the characters assembled in the line.The eventual WiiWare release also featured a local multiplayer battle mode for up to four players.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="38553">The Wonderful 101</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4647/1044364-lineattackheroes.png</image></root>
