You have to pick up passengers on your route, inform them of the next stop, make it to the next stop on time (neither too early nor too late), open the doors, etc. Any violation of traffic rules results in a fine. Get fined too often and you have to start all over.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5486">Bus Driver</game><game id="19087">Microsoft Train Simulator</game><game id="7590">Densha de Go!</game><game id="34136">OMSI: The Bus Simulator</game><game id="37986">European Bus Simulator</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1489/372279-tokyo_bus_guide.jpg</image></root>
