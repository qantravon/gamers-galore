Players control Peter Panning as he tries to save his children from the clutches of Captain Hook, similar to the Steven Spielberg movie. Most of the versions were nearly identical, the exception being the CD version which had cutscenes using stills from the movie, and a different musical score. The levels are broken up by a hub map, and feature pirate ships, winter slopes, and water levels. Plenty of pirates need to be sliced by Peter's sword skills, and some boss fights include a giant crocodile and Captain Hook himself.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16875">Mickey Mania</game><game id="1334">Super Mario World</game><game id="15621">Peter Pan</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361828-nes_hook.jpg</image></root>
