The player will controller the character movement with nunchuck, while the motion sensors in the Wii remote will allow the player to control the flashlight. The deveolpers commented that they found after extensive play testing that using the sensors in the Wii remote as opposed to the Wii remotes IR functionality would allow for a more immersive player experience. The game will also use a behind-the-back perspective to make players feel as if they are in the game. An added benefit of the new perspective is the ability to add more objects above the player's line of sight, which the old perspective restricted. Players will once again navigate a derelict Japanese mansion and other traditional Japanese houses. According to Kikuchi Fatal Frame 4 will have the largest number of explorable buildings in franchise history. The game will also feature four playable characters: Ruka, the other two girls Misaki As√¥ and Madoka Tsukimori, and Choushiro.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2842">Haunting Ground</game><game id="13817">Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare</game><game id="10780">Silent Hill 2</game><game id="14392">Silent Hill: 0rigins</game><game id="8804">Condemned: Criminal Origins</game><game id="22605">Cursed Mountain</game><game id="10369">Silent Hill 3</game><game id="17962">Clock Tower 3</game><game id="25707">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</game><game id="26599">Ghostwire</game><game id="25888">Ju-On: The Grudge</game><game id="27264">Calling</game><game id="33374">Night of Sacrifice</game><game id="42171">DreadOut</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10460/1288137-fatal_frame_iv_boxart.jpg</image></root>
