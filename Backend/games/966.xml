<root><id>966</id><name>Garfield</name><description>Players control the eponymous feline Garfield and his attempts to clean up his owner Jon's house before he gets home from grocery shopping. The game is a loose, open-ended adventure game where Garfield must reach and collect various misplaced items around the house and put them back in their correct locations. This is done with the use of a vacuum cleaner, "sucking" up items and "blowing" them back into their correct spots.   Players are limited to a few rooms initially, but after fully restoring one room the player is given a key to a new room. Most of the early unlocked rooms are on the ground floor, moving to the first floor and then finally outside, the attic and the basement. Players can also collect puzzle pieces for a in-game puzzle, as well as partake in several mini-games which will net rewards such as house items and more puzzle pieces. Though the game has a time limit, it is very easy to beat the game before it runs out.  The game also features an in-game "classic video game", which once restored to its proper place can be played. It's a  Columns-esque puzzle game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/88692/1387862-garfield__video_game_.jpg</image></root>
