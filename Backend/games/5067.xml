If the pests landed on the plant then they would begin to eat it and shrink it down the screen and if the plant shrank all the way then the game ended.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/495/888523-pssst.jpg</image></root>
