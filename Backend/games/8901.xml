The goal is to accumulate points while racing to the end of the map. There are eight different cars worth a different amount of points.   Three are worth 200 points, three are worth 300 points and two are worth 500 points.   You accumulate points throughout 32 rounds by bumping cars into objects or by jumping up in the air and landing on the vehicles. </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5075">Bump 'N' Jump</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5312/296222-burnin_rubber_03.gif</image></root>
