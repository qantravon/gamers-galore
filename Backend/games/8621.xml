Players are given a choice of 10 different licensed Hummer SUVs to drive and customise. The game was developed by budget-company Eutechnyx Limited and published by Global Star Software. The game was released on the Playstation 2 and Xbox consoles, and has been classed as one of the 'Worst PS2 games ever' by some polls. Most gamers do not realise the game even exists though, and it is a relatively obscure title. The game contains recognisable models such as the Hummer H1, H2, and H3, as well as fictional models, such as the 'Patriot' (which is emblazoned with the Stars and Stripes).</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20919">Ford Racing: Off Road</game><game id="16276">Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="13173">Ford Racing 2</game><game id="15536">Ford Racing 3</game><game id="19707">Ford Vs.
