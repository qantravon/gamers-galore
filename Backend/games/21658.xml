<root><id>21658</id><name>Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt</name><description>Rugrats Scanger Hunt is an N64 game based on the popular Rugrats franchise. The game is a boardgame where players take turns moving from space to space, not unlike Mario Party, or Sonic Shuffle. Unlike the aformentioned games however their are no minigames to speak of whatsover, and little skill is needed to win a board game (It's mostly luck based) The game has three game boards to chose from: a pyramid themed one, an underwater board, and a board in which all players are transormed into Reptar and must traverse a giant cake like enviornment. The game features a fully voiced intro which was rare for an N64 game at that time.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18043">Rugrats: Search for Reptar</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9089/326428-rugrats_scavenger_hunt.jpg</image></root>
