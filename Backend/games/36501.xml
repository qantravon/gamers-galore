This particular game was only released in Japan, where the film had a strong following. There's also another adaptation by LucasArts (then Lucasfilm Games) that should not be confused with this one. The game is a top-down adventure game reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, with a similar emphasis on exploration, combat and puzzle-solving. Connelly's character Sarah must emancipate her infant brother from Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) before a thirteen hour time limit expires. This time limit appears in-game as a clock in the top-right corner. It also represents Sarah's health and drops rapidly whenever she takes damage, though there are items that will replenish it as well.Helping Sarah are the creatures she befriends during the movie: Hoggle, Ludo and Sir Didymus. Sarah can give heart items to these characters which'll cause them to appear and help her defeat monsters for a while.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2466978-labyrinth_fc.jpg</image></root>
