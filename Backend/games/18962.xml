All the while, gamers must compete in family battles, races and other biker challenges in order to earn bike parts and the respect of Paul Sr. Players test their custom creations at the final showdown. Parts affect your speed, handling and acceleration. Paint, chrome, powder coat  decals can be added to your chopper. Better parts and respect are earned from Paul Senior by competing in family battles, races and challenges. Each bike handles differently and you perform chopper stunts: jumps, wheelies, burnouts and more while you race and perform stunts including sliding under a semi-trailer, experience police chases and more.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1801413-box_achopper2.png</image></root>
