Other handheld versions of Spyro have solely been 2D platformers, but Season of Ice is more of an exploration game. The developers said they wanted to create a game that has more similarities to the Playstation versions of Spyro rather than handheld versions.  Plot  The evil Grendor set out on as task to harm Spyro's land. Grendor's original plan failed so he decides to capture all the fairies in the land and encase them in ice. Spyro and Sparx set out on a journey to rescue all the fairies and defeat Grendor. Gameplay  Spyro's flying stages     Season of Ice is played in an isometric perspective to simulate 3D. Spyro will walk throughout the land in search of fairies and different collectibles. There are some platforming elements which play similarly to Super Mario RPG. The game is also broken down into many different mini games. The most prominent mini games are Spyro's flying stages and Sparx shooting stages. The flying missions are played from behind Spyro's back you basically navigate to collect items and avoid different obstacles. Sparx stages play like an overhead arcade shooter, where you point Sparx in different directions blasting enemies with fire.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3438">MediEvil II</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="7804">Rocket: Robot on Wheels</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="15991">Chameleon Twist 2</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="10416">Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge</game><game id="7659">Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure</game><game id="19795">Crash SuperPack</game><game id="35545">Fuse</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803995-box_spyrosoi.png</image></root>
