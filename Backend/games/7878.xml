The box art features the UK snack food KP Skips mascot at the time, "Clumsy Colin". The open world and various tasks predate similar modern gameplay by decades.GameplayThere are two distinctly different versions of the game.The Commodore 64 and Atari versions feature an isometric view with eight-way control over Colin. The player must traverse the open world to find, in order, various objects. Some objects upgrade the motorcycle, such as the gearbox and larger fuel tank. Most objects serve no in-game purpose, such as faring and riding leathers. As gameplay progresses, the world changes - the construction site develops, and previously inaccessible areas become accessible through found objects. The player must finally complete the race track within the allotted time.The ZX Spectrum versions finds Colin sleeping- he must complete his tasks before an alarm wakes him up. Gameplay takes place from the side view, where Colin must navigate roads to various houses, some of which can be entered. Most houses are empty, while some contain various upgrades. The goal is to find his friend Marti within on of the houses, and get to a spaceport before running out of time or fuel. In contrast to the Commodore version, the KP Skips snack appears in-game as a power refill. Obstacles such as other vehicles and construction must be avoided to successfully complete the game. </description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/966262-action_biker_coverart.png</image></root>
