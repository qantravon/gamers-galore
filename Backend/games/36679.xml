Players can take cover behind various objects and can pop their head out to accurately take out a foe or blind fire. Chaining kills will fill out the combo meter which in turn will build up points. Players are encouraged to beat their high score on each level by taking out multiple enemies at a time or quickly dispatching enemies with one clip.The game also lets players look for illegal aliens by scanning the environment with special glasses. Once an alien found, the player can engage an alien in different ways (speech, direct agression...).
