Kamigami no Chinmoku is the first game in the series to be released on the Super Famicom (the previous two were Famicom games). It would also eventually be rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.The story is focused around discovering the main character's identity, as he wakes up without his memory. He discovers early on that he is effectively immortal: he cannot be badly hurt, and he is able to use this unique ability to perform actions others cannot. The protagonist eventually meets various Greek gods and other famous mythological figures in his quest to discover who he is.Kamigami no Chinmoku's gameplay is retained from the previous Heracles no Eikou game: combat is entirely directed through turn-based, menu-driven commands, as was common for JRPGs of the era.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game><game id="13053">Final Fantasy VII</game><game id="9011">The Magic of Scheherazade</game><game id="12277">Final Fantasy VIII</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/569607-hercules_no_eikou_iii_box_front.jpg</image></root>
