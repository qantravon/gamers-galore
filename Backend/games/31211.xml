It is a 2 player PSP game with both players using the same PSP. The game is similar to the board game twister. The game will lay out a board of dots, and there will be a spinner. You must place the selected finger on the matching color. The game has no way of knowing if you did it or not. So it is up to the players to determine who wins.  There are 3 different grids. 3x4, 4x4, and 4x5.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/85465/1365768-pic1.png</image></root>
