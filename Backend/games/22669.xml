<root><id>22669</id><name>Deathmatch Classic</name><description>OverviewDeathmatch Classic is a first-person shooter developed and published by             Valve as a commercial modification of            Half-Life. Originally released for free with the 1.1.0.7 patch of Half-Life, it must now be purchased from the           Steam platform. (Usually bundled with other games such as the  Counter-Strike 1 Anthology) It was designed as a tribute to the multiplayer mode from          id Software's         Quake. (Since the       GoldSrc engine is based on the     Quake engine) The game plays very similarly to the original Quake, despite it having modifications based on the GoldSrc engine. (Some criticisms include slower movement speed, weaker jumping, and slightly different weapon attributes) Quake's "Q fork" symbol, among other things seen in the game, is replaced by Half-Life's circlular lambda symbol. All the weapons from the original Quake appear, despite the    axe model being replaced by a rusty version of Half-Life's   crowbar. This game also features maps that are built from the open-source Quake multiplayer maps. Player models are mostly copied from Half-Life Deathmatch.  System Requirements Minimum: 500 mhz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows 2000/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet ConnectionRecommended: 800 mhz processor, 128mb ram, 32mb  video card, Windows 2000/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection </description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8015">Quake</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1334186-dmc_vert.png</image></root>
