<root><id>11625</id><name>Ridge Racer DS</name><description>Ridge Racer DS is one of the first Nintendo DS titles and helped served to demonstrate the DS's capabilities.It is a port of Ridge Racer 64, with some alterations. For example any instance of Reiko Nagase seen in the N64 version (From the packaging to in-game artwork) is replaced by images of Gina Cavalli from R-Racing Evolution.Control SchemesIn place of an analog stick are three control schemes. Two of them making use of the touch screen.Easy Play [Pad Control]Uses the D-Pad for steering and does not use touch control.Hard Play [Stylus Control]Depending on where you place the stylus determines the turn radius.Expert Play [Slide Control]Using the wrist strap that came with the original Nintendo DS models which has a thumb pad attached, the neutral point is placed depending on where you place the thumb strap. Letting go of the screen allows to re-adjust the neutral point of the touch control steering.These control schemes are similar to what is seen in Super Mario 64 DS.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18021">Need for Speed: Carbon - Own the City</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="7431">Ford Racing</game><game id="367">Need for Speed II</game><game id="4970">Burnout Legends</game><game id="21307">Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights</game><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="21653">Asphalt: Urban GT</game><game id="24513">DiRT 2</game><game id="42324">Ridge Racer Driftopia</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1839036-box_rracerds.png</image></root>
