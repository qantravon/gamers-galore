It also superficially resembles Konami's Gradius, or Irem's R-Type, but lacks the (then) in-depth upgrade systems of those two games.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6518/506973-baltron_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
