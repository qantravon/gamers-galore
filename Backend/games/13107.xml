Your hand-shaped shuttle has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and  you must use the Power Glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to  advance. The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled  with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a  wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. Whiile  trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack  by a range of creature, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work.  The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue  the Commander.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19682">Ballblazer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14206/1186157-sg.jpg</image></root>
