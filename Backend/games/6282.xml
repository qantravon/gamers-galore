GameplayThe game is platformer. The created hero can attack by jumping on the enemy or by shooting a gun that the player can design. The gun's ammo changes depending on the world. You use the stylus to clear up any shadow goop that is left over from shadows. There are not any powerups, however when the time is needed, you are able to design solutions according to what is needed in the level.
