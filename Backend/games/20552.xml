Like that game, it is based on Edition 3.5 of the ADD Rules. It involves a completely unrelated story to the original plot, but introduces new content, such as new monsters, and new magical items and equipment. It uses the same gameplay mechanics as the original Neverwinter Nights 2 and is set in the same universe.This adventure begins at level 8, and can be played with either a brand new character, or by importing a character from the original game. The main character is then joined by three NPCs towards the beginning of the game.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17949">The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal</game><game id="2235">Planescape: Torment</game><game id="52">Baldur's Gate</game><game id="10637">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</game><game id="6795">Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</game><game id="5242">Icewind Dale</game><game id="8890">Icewind Dale II</game><game id="11474">The Temple of Elemental Evil: A Classic Greyhawk Adventure</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/30036/1292642-loeoe.jpg</image></root>
