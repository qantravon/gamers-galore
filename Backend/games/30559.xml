Pieces of meat will appear at random, and begin grilling automatically. Soon, the meat will plump, indicating that it is "Just Right." If picked up and placed on the plate at this time, the piece of meat will earn the player bonus points. Chains will also form as the player gets the meat just right multiple times in a row. If the meat is not collected at its prime, it may still be taken for points. The player will lose if a piece of meat is dropped, or if it burns due to spending too much time on the grill. The purpose of the game is to earn points and beat high scores.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6329/1313295-pic1.jpg</image></root>
