Players control Lightning McQueen through an open hub world based on Radiator Springs. Lightning interacts with the many inhabitants to play minigames, learn new abilities, and--most frequently--race them. Players collect 'Trophy Points' for accomplishing the various events, which along with a loose story progression unlock additional events at fairly regular intervals.Other game modes include:Arcade mode : Play as any unlocked character in any unlocked race or mini game.VS Mode: Pick any two unlocked characters to compete in local-only versus racing.The racing is very basic, and does not feature any weapons like most cart racers. Instead the player relies on an auto-refilling boost, power sliding, jumping and shortcuts to take and hold the lead. The NASCAR style events do not feature none of these abilities. Instead the player must avoid other players and pit effectively.This game features no online play.PlotConfusingly taking place after the movie, Lightning must re-learn abilities from the residents of Radiator Springs that he can use on the track to overtake his greatest rival, Chick Hicks (all of which happens in the movie). After besting Chick on various tracks, Chick challenges Lightning to one final tournament of races, which take place over each environment of the game culminating with a second Piston Cup victory.GameplayMini GamesAside from racing, the game features a small collection of mini-games.
