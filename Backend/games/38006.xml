<root><id>38006</id><name>Chivalry: Medieval Warfare</name><description>OverviewChivalry: Medieval Warfare is a multiplayer team-based first-person hack-and-slash game developed and published by Torn Banner for the PC (as a downloadable title via Steam, Gamersgate, and Gamestop) and as a retail title in Europe and Australia by Lace Mamba. Set in medieval times, it is a spiritual sequel to Age of Chivalry (a free mod for Half-Life 2 also developed by Torn Banner).ClassesThere are four distinct classes in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Each class has its own special ability and unique set of weapons.ArcherArcherThe archer is the ranged weapon specialist. He is best used in a support role to deliver damage to enemies from far to mid range. The archer is considerably more vulnerable in melee, when compared to the other classes. The archer's ability to inflict decent damage at long range makes him a great defensive class for harassing the enemy's front lines and keeping them off objective points. When using javelins the archer can be viable at melee range as well, thrusting them from behind a shield. Available weapons include bows, crossbows, javelins, slings, daggers, cudgels, and shields. The archer also gets a choice of various ammunition types for bows and slings.Special Ability: Rogue - Does +%50 backstab damage.Man-at-armsMan-at-armsThe man-at-arms is the lightest melee class, and relies heavily on evasion and speed abilities to land hits while trying to avoid enemy attacks. He specializes in one handed weapons and has the option of bringing a shield into battle. The man-at-arms is best played on the fringes of a battle. His speed allows him to move in and out of fights slipping in brutal hits. A good man-at-arms can evade the slow and heavy swings of a vanguard or knight, closing the distance rapidly to deliver the killing blow. Available weapons include swords, axes, clubs, staves, daggers, smoke bombs, fire pots, and shields.Special Ability: Elusive - Can perform dodgesKnightKnightThe most powerful tank melee unit on the battlefield. The knight's damage output and armour levels are offset by the lack of agility and generally slower weapons he wields. His weapons are typically slow and heavy, but absolutely devastating when they connect. Knights are slow moving, but they can take significantly more damage than the other classes. Knights often move the front line and charge into large groups. His imposing frame and plate armour make him ideal for standing ground and defending a point. Only a headshot from a heavy crossbow can kill a knight in one hit. Available weapons include one handed, bastard, and two handed swords, axes, hammers, flails, throwing axes, and shields.Special Ability: Tank â€“ Can absorb additional damage and takes less stamina to block incoming blows.VanguardVanguardThe vanguard is an imposing aggressive force which forms the front line of an army. His weapons have extremely long reach and deal incredible damage. Generally making up a good portion of a team, the vanguard is typically the core warrior in battle. He has a large variety of weapons, most of which have extreme range (enough to kick an enemy away and still hit him with a swing). His charge ability can one-shot the lower armoured classes, though it can be supremely costly if missed. The vanguard is an all-around class capable of any role. Available weapons include poleaxes, polehammers, spears, greatswords, billhooks, throwing axes, and throwing knives.Special Ability: Charge - Can sprint attack into battle.WeaponsArcher BowsLongbow- A bow with a good mix of speed, damage, and range.
