Jibolba wanted to see if Tak and Lok would come back. In Feathercrag, Tak and Lok are looking for a Phoenix to grab a feather to go to the Juju Challenge. Two unknown men took the feather. Tak and Lok are summoned by the Moon Juju to introduce the teams: Team Grammazon, Team Jibba Jabba, Team Black Mist (The two unknown men) and Team Pupanunu (Tak  Lok). After the first 3 challenges, the Black Mist had been eliminated. The Black Mist came back at the Shaman Snack Shack when they messed up the scores at the Two-Headed Juju. After 3 more challenges and a proving ground match, Flora and Fauna found Grammazon teeth on the Salt Lick of Performance Enchancement which eliminated the Grammazons. Before the next match, Tak and Lok see Black Mist talking to an unknown Juju to find Moon Juju. After the next 3 matches and a proving ground match, Jibba Jabba got eliminated. Team Black Mist wanted to burn the Pupanunu village and "Crug" talked with Moon Juju and reminded her of someone else. At the Gates of Nocturne, Tak and Lok found Crug and revealed they cheated with Dark Juju. At Caster's Hill, Crug wasn't there. At Ambush Grove, they found Crug on the floor who defeated an invisible lizard and gave Lok the Ancient Hammer of Handy Juju. At the final proving grounds, Dark Juju reveals himself and announces his love to Moon Juju. After three rounds, Team Pupanunu won. They returned to the Shaman Snack Shack but nobody was there to begin a party except Jibolba. So they did a high-five.
