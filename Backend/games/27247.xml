Once this is accomplished, the planet will disappear and the player's gauge will be filled. The goal is to fill the gauge by removing planets from play, but planets of different colors cannot touch each other.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30851">Pinch</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19275/1075190-screens_mosaic.jpg</image></root>
