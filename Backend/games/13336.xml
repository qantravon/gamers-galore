Besides a PSP port of Dark Mirror, it and Logan's Shadow are the only Syphon Filter games for the system. Unlike traditional Syphon Filter games this one has a strong multiplayer component. (In fact, the publisher Sony Computer Entertainment had the single player added on late in the development process to appeal to more people).Character CustomizationYour agent is your ownCustomizing your character is one of the biggest aspects of The Omega Strain. At the start of the game you choose what you want your character to look like from several available options. As players complete missions and get further in the game, they unlock more clothing options and appearance options.Unlocking WeaponsThe game also allows player to earn badges from using certain weapons. They can pin these badges on their clothes, and the badges also unlock more weapons. Completing certain tasks throughout the game can also reward players with more guns and equipment.ControversyAt some point in the development of the game, there was a level featuring Québécois terrorists seizing control of a Toronto subway station. The terrorist organization was named Le Front de libération du Québec, after its real-world counterpart. This caused an uproar in Canada, after which Sony apologized and decided to cut the level from the game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17614">Rogue Ops</game><game id="14979">Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma</game><game id="3748">Urban Chaos: Riot Response</game><game id="576">Resident Evil: Outbreak</game><game id="1248">Syphon Filter</game><game id="8442">ONE</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2154886-box_sfiltertos.png</image></root>
