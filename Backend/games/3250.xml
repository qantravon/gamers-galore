The writer and designer, Steve Meretzky, wished instead to create a game which was mainly story-driven in nature, highlighting numerous social and political themes in the process. The strong storyline and serious tone has lent much critical acclaim to the game over the years, despite the fact that at launch, it was not a commercial success. AMFV was also the first Infocom game to feature the advanced "Interactive Fiction Plus" line coding, meaning that greater computational calculations meant greater system requirements.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8075">Trinity</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/679440-amfv_front.jpg</image></root>
