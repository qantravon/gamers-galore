The game is virtually impossible without the assistance of cues telling you when to punch and which punch to throw.   You must learn each of the four rival boxers movements and learn when to strike. As  The Kid, you have two arm cannons at your disposal, capable of  hooks,  jabs and the deadly  uppercut. To win you need to knock out your opponent, you have three rounds to do so, with the health of you and your opponent in the bottom of the screen. In between matches you can allocate power points to your left arm, your right arm and your health. You cannot move more than half of your points to one selection, ruling out the possibility of overpowering your left arm and just throwing punches with it, or doing the same to your health and just out lasting your opponent.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="20">Boxing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13379">Supreme Warrior</game><game id="33">Slam City with Scottie Pippen</game><game id="13997">George Foreman's KO Boxing</game><game id="1260">Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing</game><game id="27106">Joe Montana's NFL Football</game><game id="7432">Formula One World Championship: Beyond the Limit</game><game id="14857">Toughman Contest</game><game id="18020">Fahrenheit</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14206/1048162-pf.jpg</image></root>
