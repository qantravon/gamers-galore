It follows a living pixel on a journey through gaming hardware of the past, visiting worlds based on systems like the Atari 2600, ZX81, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, BBC Model B, Game Boy and NES. Controls are simple, consisting of left and right movement, as well as a particularly floaty jump and a double jump. You will also encounter some ladders later in the game which can be ascended and descended by pressing up and down.Each world, represented by a particular platform, consists of 8 levels. The obstacles in the game are fairly basic for a platformer, and consist of lava pits, roaming enemies and some limited projectiles. Each level contains a certain number of collectables which must be found in order to unlock the door that ends the level. Most levels also have one of more extra collectables which is usually harder to reach.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35505">Sound Shapes</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2410365-avatar_2332005.jpg</image></root>
