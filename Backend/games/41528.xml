The player is equipped with a flashlight, and can listen for "white noise" that indicates a tape is near. If the player spots the monster, the screen will flash and an outline of it will appear. As in Slender, looking at the monster too much will gradually drive the player character insane (signified by white light obscuring the screen) and end the game.After completing the game, harder difficulties and modifiers can be unlocked by playing again and finding more tapes.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39028">Slender: The Eight Pages</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19679/2429543-lg_boxart.jpg</image></root>
