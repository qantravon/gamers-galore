To beat an opponent, in this stage, it’s necessary to win five points. Stage 2 has 5 opponents and 2 points are needed to win. In the last stage only one point is needed to win in a fight, but there are 7 opponents. In case of a tie, there is a points structure that decides the winner. If the time limit reaches zero, both players will be granted a point.There is a bonus stage, between stages. In this stage the player has to block successive arrows thrown by an archer in order to gain additional points.On stage 1 and 2, 2 successive out-of-bounds results in a point loss. In stage 3, that doesn’t happen, because the player can’t go out-of-bounds.
