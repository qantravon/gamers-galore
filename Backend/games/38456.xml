It is currently being developed by veterans of The Witcher and The Witcher 2 teams at CD Projekt RED. The game is based on Mike Pondsmith's pen  paper RPG "Cyberpunk". Players will be able to create and customize their own characters, there will be different classes and the game will be non-linear and is not intended for everybody as it supposedly features "mature content" as well as "advanced RPG mechanics".</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13948">System Shock</game><game id="8870">System Shock 2</game><game id="21358">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</game><game id="9883">Deus Ex: Invisible War</game><game id="17533">Deus Ex</game><game id="37894">Shadowrun Returns</game><game id="21710">Shadowrun</game><game id="21198">Shadowrun</game><game id="34672">Shadowrun</game><game id="29717">E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</game><game id="10865">Syndicate</game><game id="4030">Blade Runner</game><game id="36172">Remember Me</game><game id="42241">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/19306/2346715-1600x1200_logo.jpg</image></root>
