The game features a total of four different environments, split up into 12 tracks. 

Rather than the usual straightways, tunnels and curves of most racers, the design goes for wild track layouts with incredible jumps and stunts and tons of obstacles. 

Although players select from only four different cars, each vehicles attributes can be tinkered with to achieve unique handling, combat abilities, and racing characteristics.

-4 racing environments each with 3 tracks: Metro City, Grand Keys, the Pole and the Red Planet.

-12 selectable cars with individual handling, combat and racing characteristics.

-Ultra cool car dynamics and track layouts allows for awesome jumps and stunts.

-3 different race classes and hidden vehicles for enhanced replay value.

-Native support for 3Dfx and Direct 3D.</description><genres><genre>Racing</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8315-1.jpg</image></root>
