The game was originally revealed in a 3DS trailer montage during E3 2011 and it is the first Tekken game to appear on a Nintendo handheld since Tekken Advance. The first two characters revealed were Kazuya Mishima and the young version of Heihachi Mishima originally created for Tekken Tag Tournament 2. The game features survival, and arcade-style (labelled "Quick Battle") single player game modes, as well as both Internet and local network play. The game also utilises the ranking system featured in Tekken 6. After the player reaches a certain rank with any character, alternate colored costumes can then be unlocked for said fighter by continuing to rank-up.CharactersThe complete roster consists of all the playable characters featured in the updated Tekken 6 release: Bloodline Rebellion:Alisa BosconovitchAnna WilliamsArmor KingAsuka KazamaBaek Doo SanBobBruce IrvinBryan FuryCraig MardukChristie MonteiroDevil JinEddy GordoFeng WeiGanryuHeihachi MishimaHwoarangJack-6Jin KazamaJulia ChangKazuya MishimaKingKuma/PandaLars AlexanderssonLee ChaolanLei WulongLeoLiliLing XiaoyuMarshall LawMiguel Caballero RojoMokujinNina WilliamsPaul PheonixRavenRoger Jr.Sergei DragunovSteve FoxWang JinreiYoshimitsuZafinaTekken: Blood VengeanceThe CG animated film Tekken: Blood Vengeance is included on the game card and can be viewed in 3D.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28437">Super Street Fighter IV</game><game id="31762">Dead or Alive: Dimensions</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2136553-box_tek3dpe.png</image></root>
