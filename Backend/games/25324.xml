Fall of X.A.N.A. encompasses an alternate version of Season 4, in the same timeframe as Quest For Infinity for the Wii, Playstation 2, and Playstation Portable.Unlike its platformer brethren, Fall of X.A.N.A. uses the DS's touchscreen exclusively - movement, encounter commands, and between-level interaction at Kadic Academy are all dictated by the touch of the stylus. The game continues the series' tradition, however, of punctuating events with FMV clips of the cartoon (though lacking the voice support of Quest For Infinity).</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13447">Code Lyoko</game><game id="25325">Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/27993/888889-foto_code_lyoko__fall_of_x.a.n.a..jpg.jpg</image></root>
