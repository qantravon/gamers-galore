The entire game runs on a 3D engine, and a system from       Wild Arms 2 and      3 that allows you to skip a random encounter is present. In addition to the original playable cast -     Rudy Roughnight,    Cecilia Adlehyde, and   Jack Van Burace - three characters additional characters can be recruited. Two of these made fleeting appearances in the original game, the Professor Emma Hetfield and Jane Maxwell, and the third is a secret character that can be recruited at the end of the game.  The Japanese version of the game was released in 2003, with a much-delayed North America version arriving in 2005. It was not released in PAL territories.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7197">Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</game><game id="4001">Shadow Hearts: Covenant</game><game id="12349">Shadow Hearts: From the New World</game><game id="8600">Xenosaga: Episode III - Also Sprach Zarathustra</game><game id="20336">Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht</game><game id="11093">Xenosaga: Episode II - Jenseits von Gut und Böse</game><game id="3579">Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King</game><game id="19152">Suikoden V</game><game id="18991">Suikoden IV</game><game id="11252">Suikoden III</game><game id="2959">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</game><game id="21373">Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4</game><game id="4473">Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</game><game id="16836">Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne</game><game id="1914">Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2</game><game id="11237">Final Fantasy X</game><game id="11497">Final Fantasy XII</game><game id="10129">Grandia II</game><game id="259">Grandia III</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2100006-box_wildarmsacf.png</image></root>
