<root><id>30701</id><name>Sherlock: The Game of Logic</name><description>Sherlock was developed by Everett Kaser Software and consists of a game board divided into a grid; at the easiest difficulty the grid is 3x3, scaling up to 8x8 at the hardest difficulty. Each row contains images of a specific type, like numbers or faces. To the left of the game board are a series of clues that give horizontal relationships between objects and at the bottom are clues that give vertical relationships. Using these clues, the player must deduce which object belongs in each grid square. The game engine randomizes object placement and generates clues from one board to the next.   Sherlock is distributed as shareware.  A demo version consisting of a few puzzles is available as a free download. The licensed version unlocks all the puzzles as well as extra tile sets. Users can also create custom tile sets.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/37092/1327610-sherlock_game.jpg</image></root>
