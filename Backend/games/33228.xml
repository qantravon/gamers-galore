<root><id>33228</id><name>Crows: The Battle Action for Sega Saturn</name><description>OverviewA standard beat em up in the vein of Double Dragon. Although the game may play like a beat em up before each stage you get to choose what kind of combos you are allowed to do during the stage. Doesn't mean it isn't a beat em up but it at least has that unique feature in the game. This game is also based on the Crow manga and it has a anime like look to it as well. Although they went with a more super deformed style instead of going with a look that would match the manga.</description><genres><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="6608">River City Ransom</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/113650/1637977-crowsaturn.jpg</image></root>
