<root><id>5699</id><name>Enduro Racer</name><description>OverviewOne of Sega's most highly regarded Arcade games, Enduro Racer is a follow-up to Hang-On and focuses more on the stunts and jumps unique to motocross among all other forms of motorbike racing. Players must reach the finish line within the time limit, avoiding other players and obstacles and carefully navigating over each jump.Most home ports attempted to emulate the Arcade's ever-shifting 3D perspective to varying degrees of success depending on each respective system's graphical power.For the Sega Master System port, Enduro Racer is depicted from an isometric perspective and plays very differently. It does allow players to customize their vehicle with upgrades between each race, using points earned for how many vehicles they overtook. This would be the version that would later see a rerelease for Nintendo's Wii Shop, specifically the Virtual Console. Unfortunately, a lot of the content was removed for the US and international versions, including several tracks.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11570">Hang-On</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362888-sms_enduroracer.jpg</image></root>
