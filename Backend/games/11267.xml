Though Madou Monogatari II is technically the first Madou Monogatari game to be released, as it was featured in Compile's Christmas '89 edition of Disc Station Magazine before the release of 1-2-3, Madou Monogatari I is the only individual chapter to be ported to a platform other than the Game Gear. While the Game Gear release is a scaled-down port of the MSX version with minor changes, the PC-Engine CD version adds even more voice acting; likewise, the Mega Drive version adds several floors to the game's tower and maps each spell to a D-Pad input.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16207/2370705-madou1gg.jpg</image></root>
