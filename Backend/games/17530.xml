While each wild minion the player encounters has an element (again much like pokemon) minions born of fusion can have two elements, which can be a tactical advantage if used correctly.The player occupies the role of silent protagonist Levant. Early in the game, his village of Syrus is attacked by a locust-like species of minons called the Onibubu. After the attack, many people in the village are struck with an illness and fall into a deep slumber. Being the son of a former "cocoon master" gone missing, Levant is chosen as the one to venture into the forests to find the Calabas herb to cure the illness inflicting his village. The game also includes FMV cutscenes designed in an anime style by Katsuya Kondo, known for his work with studio Ghibli.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19107">Monster Rancher 2</game><game id="4508">Guardian's Crusade</game><game id="3966">Pokémon Red/Blue</game><game id="22985">Linda³</game><game id="8210">Pokémon Gold/Silver</game><game id="16933">Monster Rancher EVO</game><game id="11552">Pokémon Emerald</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478663-box_jcsott.png</image></root>
