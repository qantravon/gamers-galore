<root><id>11232</id><name>Industry Giant II</name><description>A game for management buffs Industry Giant 2, is a game where you have to decide what goods to manufacture according to the needs of the villages and cities around you, and then distribute  those      goods to the target population as best as you can. In order to do this you have to decide which of the transport methods offered by the game are more efficient.     Cities will slowly grow or decrease, based on a number of factors. You can use a variety of trucks, boats, airplanes and trains to get your merchandise to your warehouses, which then are carried to your stores and sold. This is trickier than it might seem, since each of these transport methods have different speeds, maintenance costs and cargo capacities.  Your decision to supply this town instead of that one may influence population growth and consequencially the future demand for your products. However, thats were your influence on the scenario stops. This isn't a SimCity game, and if your looking for a wider range of influence on the cities, or more gameplay variety, this may not be the best game for you. Graphics aren't Industry Giant 2's main strength but they are clear and although this isn't a beautifull game, it gets it's point across handsomely.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1491/408655-ig2_pic1.jpg</image></root>
