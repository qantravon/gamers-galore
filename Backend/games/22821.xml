AA combines both real-time and turn-based strategy elements into one giant managing system. The game features three modes of play:  World War Mode- An open-ended game where the player chooses a side (Axis or Allies) and attempts to eleminate the opposing faction. The game is managed through a map of the world which plays out in turns. After every turn the player fights small scale battles in an RTS style of play.   Campaign- You select your nation and leader and begin to play out WWII. This mode uses the same play styles of World War Mode.  Skirmish- In skirmish you fight small to medium scale RTS battles without the Turn-Based map element. Similar rules are applied to multiplayer matches.     </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18930">Company of Heroes</game><game id="4750">Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts</game><game id="16099">Axis &amp; Allies</game><game id="3537">Conflict Zone</game><game id="29748">RISK: Factions</game><game id="27816">Greed Corp</game><game id="20195">War Front: Turning Point</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15405/456975-axis___allies__2004__coverart.jpg</image></root>
