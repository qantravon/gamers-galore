In Battle on the Edge, the oval course took place inside a greenhouse.The other major difference in Power Edition is the addition of a 4th course, which is actually just the first 3 course connected together in a point-A-to-point-B race with no laps.</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10050">OutRun 2</game><game id="8458">San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing</game><game id="23062">Sega Super GT</game><game id="23244">Rave Racer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/447584-daytona_2.png</image></root>
