It is noted for being the third game to have Nintendo DS connectivity, allowing for the creation of custom characters by using the touchscreen on the DS to draw on facial features for characters to be used in the Wii game.The game itself was very lazily designed, panned by reviewers for its "waggle-and-win design". The game contains 6 different sports, played on a beach, with very simplified rule sets. Gameplay is thus limited to basic motions and timing. The game makes an attempt to adapt difficulty to player skill by using a skill point system, which starts at a default value and raises or lowers depending on player performance. As games are replayed, they become easier or harder based on past performance.SportsBig Beach Sports is a Wii Sports-like take on 6 "Beach" Sports:SoccerAmerican FootballCricketDisc GolfBocce Bal Volleyball</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="17">Minigame Collection</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13328">Wii Sports</game><game id="21098">Wii Sports Resort</game><game id="32733">101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2578/183078-bbs.jpg</image></root>
