Tetris Blast features both a single player mode and a two player mode. Tetris Blast differs in some ways from the original     Tetris. In Tetris Blast there are pieces of the blocks that contain bombs, when the bombs are part of a row that has been completed they will explode. If four bombs are touching and make up a square they will turn into a large bomb which will explode much larger than the regular size bombs.  ModesIn Tetris Blast there are three different playable single player modes:  Contest  In contest mode there is a different arrangement of  already placed blocks and the goal is to try and remove all blocks from  the field. Contest mode features a password save system.   Contest Mode Training  Training mode is an infinite mode where the player can select the speed of the falling blocks.  Training Mode  Fight   In fight mode a computer opponent is chosen. The computer opponent will  travel back and forth across the play field and the goal is to hit the  enemy with enough of the bomb blocks to reduce their health to zero.  The Second Level Enemy in Fight Mode </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13943">Pac-Attack</game><game id="2755">Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4879/486896-gb_blast_box_front.jpg</image></root>
