<root><id>39772</id><name>Funky Barn</name><description>OverviewFunky Barn is a sandbox farm "simulator" for the Nintendo WiiU that tasks you with control of your own farm, It is an enhanced port of the Ubisoft published 3DS title Funky Barn 3D that was released in April of 2012.GameplayThe game revolves around growing one of 3 farms by managing livestock and crops while using strange farming tools such as a Shearing Machine that fires out shorn sheep, or a "Flying FruitBox-Haybale-Copter" which flies around to collect grain and fruit.In the beginning, all the player owns is an empty field, a few coins, and a single baby chick. If the player feeds and takes care of the chick, it will create produce that can be sold. With this money, the player can buy new facilities at the farmer's market and purchase equipment from the shopkeeper. Little by little, as the farm builds up, the player will unlock new animals and equipment, including a feeding trough, fence builders, a guard dog, and a milking machine. The player can also exchange animals with their friends who play Funky Barn.The game takes advantage of the WiiU's gamepad for features such as shaking the gamepad to make fruit fall from trees.AwardsThe game won Giant Bomb's Miiverse Community of the Year award in 2012 for the community's various pictures that riff on title (example: sheep with afros), in many cases without people ever having played the actual game.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2168">Viva Piñata</game><game id="20682">Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise</game><game id="31048">FarmVille</game><game id="39694">FarmVille 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2368427-box_fbarn.png</image></root>
