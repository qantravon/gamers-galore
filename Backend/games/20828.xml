The protagonist walks across the stage dodging obstacles and taking down minor enemies in one or two hits, before eventually making it to a one-on-one duel with the stage's boss. Defeating this boss allows the player to progress to the next stage.The hero is clearly modeled on Kung Fu legend Bruce Lee, though the game has no obvious references to any of his films. The game would eventually be ported to the Wii's Virtual Console as part of its library of Turbografx-16 games.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game><game id="10879">Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365516-tg16_chinawarrior.jpg</image></root>
