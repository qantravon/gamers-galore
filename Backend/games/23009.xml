You could play up to one to five songs with a single session of gameplay, but also get extra songs by achieving a great score within the game.The gameplay is simple as the corresponding buttons would appear on the screen from left to right, and the user must hit the buttons at the correct time. Scoring is based on how closely the player's performance and timing matches the original song.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23011">DrumMania</game><game id="23939">AC/DC Live: Rock Band</game><game id="23848">Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2</game><game id="23219">Guitar Rising</game><game id="24711">Guitar Hero 5</game><game id="5639">Quest for Fame</game><game id="27138">Guitar Hero Arcade</game><game id="25536">Guitar Hero: Van Halen</game><game id="32905">Singstar Guitar</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2424/499239-gui_logo.gif</image></root>
