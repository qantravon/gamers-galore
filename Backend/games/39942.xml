While the game has action elements, such as fighting armed robbers in the street with a catapult, the core of the game is the adventure mystery puzzle that the player must solve by walking to different buildings and talking to the NPCs that inhabit them.Because the show is unheard of outside of Japan, the game was never released outside that territory.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10395">The Goonies II</game><game id="658">Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</game><game id="40394">Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2340068-omoikkiri_tanteidan_haado_gumi_matenrou_no_chousenjou_fds_box.jpg</image></root>
