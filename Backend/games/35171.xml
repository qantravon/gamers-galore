To make this a little more complicated there's two gofers Bud and Buzz constantly taunting the player and blocking ramps when popping up, as well as providing entry ways to lock the balls.No Good Gofers also is Pat Lawlor's final pinball design and machine for Williams before their eventual closing in 1999. Besides the two gofers the machine features a "slam ramp" that lets the user shoot a ball onto an upper playfield called the "Driving Range" where the player can hit a not-so-easy "Hole-in-One" (see below).Hole-in-One ShotOften called 'one of the greatest shots in pinball history', and a very difficult shot to make, too! The players has to lower the "Slam Ramp" first to make the "driving range" accessible, then time a perfect shot over another small ramp in front of a small hole on the far right side of the "driving range". Sometimes the player gets lucky and a shot at the golf cart bounces off into the hole for a "Hole-in-One".</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1780714-ngg.jpg</image></root>
