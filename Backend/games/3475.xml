The game consists of a player on a block platform and a wall of blocks roll towards him. The wall will consist of white, green, and black blocks. The player must highlight blocks on the ground, then, when a block rolls over the highlighted space, it disappears. The trick is, the player can only remove the white and green blocks. If black box is removed, the platform the player is standing on will get shorter resulting less room to work with. The player can use special blocks and setups to remove many blocks at once. The game only allows a certain number of moves per level. Of course, the player can exceed the limit but that also lessens the score. The game has 1000 levels to play through and gets increasingly challenging.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2132497-iqmania.png</image></root>
