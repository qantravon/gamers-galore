After the latter demonstrates the power of his new invention, too late does the main character realize that opening a       wormhole might be a bit of a problem. Indeed, after the successful demonstration, some      aliens (who look like Casper the friendly ghost)     kidnap the genius uncle and it is up for the nephew to save him (literally) from the    spaceship. But getting there in the first place is not as easy as it sounds (actually, it does not sound easy at all) Alien Incident plays like a classic 2D adventure, featuring extensive, often humorous dialogue, a icon-driven   inventory, many locations and characters. The game features one  maze sequence which became inamous among the fanbase for being incredibly hard to beat without refering to a solution. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6728">Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</game><game id="2037">Maniac Mansion</game><game id="4372">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2522590-alien_incident_pc.jpg</image></root>
