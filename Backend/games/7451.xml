The ship itself starts as a 3 stage ship and you control one stage at a time. The nose cone stage of the ship only has one cannon but the second and third have two. Also, after you defeat a few waves you can dock one stage onto the next, giving you more fire power with which to defeat the enemies.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2445">Galaxian</game><game id="29829">Dangerous Seed</game><game id="41633">Red Alert</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/456/274593-mc.jpg</image></root>
