This fifth Ace Attorney game will be released for the Nintendo 3DS and will be set one year after the events of Apollo Justice. Phoenix Wright has been re-instated as a defense attorney, and returns as the main character with a new female partner, Athena Cykes. Apollo will also return in this game.Dual Destinies will be the first game to move away from the series' 2D artwork, this time using 3D models for all its characters. Capcom also stated that catch-phrases such as "Objection!" and "Hold it!" will be rerecorded instead of using the same soundbites from the older games, as the original voice actor, Ben Judd, is no longer with Capcom. Instead, Sam Riegel will reprise his role as Wright from Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3.The first case will involve an explosion in the series' original courthouse, and will see Phoenix facing off against Winston Payne's brother.Shu Takumi will not be involved with this game, as he was tied up with Professor Layton vs Ace Attorney during the game's development. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="32927">Layton Kyouju VS Gyakuten Saiban</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2570194-untitled.png</image></root>
