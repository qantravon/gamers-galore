<root><id>32719</id><name>Dynasty Warriors 7</name><description>OverviewDynasty Warriors 7 is a PS3/ Xbox 360 entry in Koei's long-running Dynasty Warriors series. The game was released in North America on March 29, 2011 for both platforms. The game features over sixty playable characters from the Shu, Wei, and Wu kingdoms, as well as the new faction Jin. Although characters from other factions are included, they are not playable in the primary story mode. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game support stereoscopic 3D.StoryDynasty Warriors 7 features a completely revamped story mode. Similar to Dynasty Warriors 4, each kingdom has its own story. However, for this entry, the officer played in each mission is fixed in a manner similar to Warriors: Legends of Troy. The game also does away with the pre-battle planning screen and instead transitions seamlessly from cutscenes to control of the chapter's playable character, either in camp (where the player may make preparations such as equipping weapons or spending skill points) or directly into battle.For the first time in the series, the storyline does not end at the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains. The game instead tells the story of the Jin kingdom, which arose late in the Three Kingdoms era and eventually won out, uniting China and establishing the Jin Dynasty in 280 A.D. The vast majority of the Jin-aligned characters are all-new, with only Sima Yi (formerly a Wei character) returning from previous entries. The Jin storyline begins with stopping Gongsun Yuan's rebellion, and ends with the final stage being the subjugation of Shu and the surrender of Liu Shan.Conquest ModeConquest Mode is the second primary gameplay mode. In it, the player selects a character and advances across a map of China by completing missions. Scattered about the map are cities that the player may visit once freed, where weapons can be forged and purchased, visiting characters may be spoken with, and other special events may take place. Each character also has access to their own Historic Battle challenges ("Legend" stages), with some based on events of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, while others are original scenarios.GameplayThe combat gameplay is similar to the classic "Charge" attack system seen in titles predating Dynasty Warriors 6. This game also borrows the dual weapon system used in Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce. Each character is capable of using two weapons. The player can freely equip different weapon types to each character, though characters equipped with a weapon they have poor affinity with are not as effective as they are with other weapons. Characters can also actively switch between their equipped weapons during battle and will perform a special attack during the transition.The musou gauge is split in up to two bars. This is similar to Samurai Warriors 3, allowing the player to do multiple musou attacks in a row. In addition to the standard and horse-mounted musou attack variants, some characters can unlock a second standard musou, and some can perform musou attacks in midair.A new addition to the gameplay is the use of siege weapons. In previous games, such weapons appeared strictly as either obstacles to destroy or targets to protect. However, in Dynasty Warriors 7, the player can take active control of siege weapons in select stages, including catapults, ballistas, and others. Use of such weapons is required to complete certain objectives, such as destroying gates or sinking ships.Playable CharactersKingdom of WeiCao CaoCao CaoFirst Playable Appearance: Dynasty WarriorsEX Weapon: SwordVoice Actor: Douglas RyeLeader of Wei, known as the "Hero of Chaos."Cao PiCao PiFirst Playable Appearance: Dynasty Warriors 5EX Weapon: Dual SwordsVoice Actor: Doug ErholtzCao Cao's son and Zhen Ji's Husband, succeeds his father as the leader of Wei.Xiahou DunXiahou DunFirst Playable Appearance: Dynasty WarriorsEX Weapon: SwordVoice Actor: Kirk ThorntonCao Cao's right hand general.
