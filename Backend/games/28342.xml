The port features redrawn graphics by Yoshimiru Hoshi (the game's original creator and character designer), a new soundtrack, and additional scenes that had to be cut from Metal Slader's original release on the Famicom. Hal Laboratory developed the Director's Cut for the Super Famicom and Nintendo published the title on November 29, 2000. Metal Slader Glory: Director's Cut holds the honor of being the very last officially released Super Famicom game to come out for the system.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5758">Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shoujo</game><game id="12552">Snatcher</game><game id="15090">Policenauts</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/1776514-cover.jpg</image></root>
