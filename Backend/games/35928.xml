Based on the 1984-1985 Voltron: Defender of the Universe animated series.GameplayVoltron is primarily a dual-joystick shooter where players control one of the five Lion Force Voltron pilots (either piloting their giant robot lions or battling on-foot when their robots lose their health). There are also shoot 'em up (or shmup) levels, along with bonus boss battle sections focused on co-operative turn-based combat and quick time events.DelistedVoltron: Defender of the Universe was removed from both Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network only a year after its release. Though no official statement was released, it no doubt had to do with publisher THQ's bankruptcy preventing them from renewing the license with World Events Productions.</description><genres><genre id="31">Dual-Joystick Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25305">G.I.
