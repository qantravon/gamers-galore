<root><id>20538</id><name>Mafia II</name><description>OverviewMafia II is a  sandbox-style  third-person action/driving game developed by  2K Czech for the  Xbox 360,  Playstation 3, and  Games for Windows. The game was announced at the 2007 Leipzig Games Convention, where five screenshots along with a brief trailer were revealed. After two delays, Mafia II was released in North America on August 24, 2010 and internationally on August 27, 2010.Set in the post-WW2 era, the player assumes the role of  Vito Scaletta, a young soldier returning from  World War 2 to  Empire Bay after a tour of duty overseas. Vito and his friend,  Joe Barbaro, begin working in the criminal underworld of Empire Bay upon Vito's return. The story focuses on Vito and Joeâ€™s friendship and life as part of the mafia. Mafia II plans to be much darker and less romantic than  the first game showing the story of a made man. The game will be set in the 1940s and 1950s in Empire Bay, a city inspired by  New York and  San Francisco.StoryMafia II's story follows the long and dark journey of Vito Scalleta, as he progresses through his life of becoming a made man in the  mafia. The game's setting will feature staples of the post-World War II period through the course of the story. In the game, you start poor but with the help of your friend Joe, you'll start doing a lot of criminal stuff to get money, booze, and chicks. First, you fight in WW2 for short time. Then, you come back and live in your mother's apartment for a day. You have a sister named Francesca Scaletta. You meet many people on your journey and make many bad decisions that you and Joe must fix.GameplayMafia II takes place in 10 square miles of open-ended environments, and the player is able to explore the entire scenario without any restrictions from the start of the game. There are no loading screens, city will load continuously during play.The Law in Empire Bay must be obeyed. When these laws are broken in view of the police, they will respond. However, the police interaction will be toned down compared to its predecessor.New FeaturesVehicles can be customized, tuned, and repaired.There are over 120 licensed songs split between both eras and over 3 hours of original composed music.There are about 50 different vehicles between both eras and can get dirty, suffer damage and run out of gas.The  AI has been improved, so the pedestrians will smoke, read newspapers, buy clothes, and wait for buses, while homeless people will search through garbage bins.The player can own their own customizable cars that can even be customized with a personal license plate. Up to ten vehicles can be stored in Vito's garage.Since such heavy emphasis has been placed on your own personal ride, the ability to utilize public transportation has been taken out. Vito may still ride in a cab for mission or two though.Vito can buy various foods and drinks in restaurants scattered about the city.Vito can also vandalize those restaurants and any other stores and the cops will be called. If you return to the scene of the crime you'll see police tape and the clerk or witnesses telling the officer your description based on what clothes you were wearing.Cops only radio for reinforcements if you committed a large enough crime. New and multiple strategies to deceive them.The police can chase other criminals instead of just you, and therefore it will contribute to their new, greater leniency.There are 15 main chapters and some interwoven, voluntary sub-missions.New and improved checkpoints.The story may vary depending on how the player chooses to progress throughout the game.In missions with a car, Joe often rides with you. Player controlled drive-by shooting has been completely taken out, though Joe may shoot out of the window when you're driving.There are multiple gangs who have their territories in the different districts of Empire Bay.There are two types of context-sensitive environment interactions: A "standard" action and a "violent" action.Vito can steal a car by smashing the window,  lockpicking, or  carjacking.Objects in the environment e.g. bottles, chairs, etc. will be interactive, in both standard and violent contexts.The game features over 200  hand-to-hand animations, as well as using the environment as an integral part of that combat. Cover positions are used and can be  destroyed.Graphically, violence will take a less 'gory', more realistic approach (i.e. bullet wounds, blood stains/ splatters.)Many guns from the first game are back (i.e.  Thompson M1928,  Colt 1911, pump-shotgun) but the 50's will bring about more modern firearms.Playboy pin-ups can be found throughout the game.There is very little indication of your health; the HUD can be switched on and off, the contents of the HUD can also be altered.Health  regenerates; taking cover makes it regenerate faster, but it only fills up a certain amount from where you stopped taking damage, meaning if it doesn't fill up, you'll need to eat food to recover fully.Includes 50 collectible anachronistic  Playboy centerfolds, which were published ranging from seven to seventeen years after the end of the game.MissionsThe Old CountryHome Sweet HomeEnemy of the StateMurphy's LawThe BuzzsawTime Well SpentIn Loving Memory...The Wild OnesBalls and BeansRoom ServiceA
