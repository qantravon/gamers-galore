The goal of each stage is to reach the hole on the green and pot the ball in as few strokes as possible, but each of the courses are covered with various obstacles - some animated, some stationary. The player must navigate around them (or use them to their advantage, in some cases) in order to achieve the best score.</description><genres><genre id="28">Golf</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9316">Kirby's Dream Course</game><game id="39302">Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375250-putt_putt_golf_fds.jpg</image></root>
