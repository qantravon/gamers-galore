You play as the web-slinging hero Spider-Man, in a city which needs constant protection against several kinds of evil. Just like the movie, three recognizable villains are in the game in the form of New Goblin, Sandman and Venom. You battle with each enemy at some point in the game and these fights are similar to the movie fights.The game takes place in New York City and features some of the monumental buildings you would expect to see. You will get plenty of chances to swing around the city at leisure and take to the skyline of New York City to catch all the views. While swinging around the city, you encounter a lot of combat throughout the game in the form of bank robbers, robots, gangs and plenty more. Many of the battles are fast paced, but that's what Spider-Man's "Spider Sense" is for.Symbiote Suit Spider-ManIn addition to the main story-line, the side missions include collecting tokens around the city, trick races, combat tours, bomb tours, and completing random crime missions. Combat tours require you to fight a certain amount of gang members throughout the city in a specified amount of time. Similar to combat tours, bomb tours instruct you to disarm a number of bombs located throughout the city in a given amount of time.The general gameplay is very similar to that of the previous title in this series, Spider-Man 2, it just offers a different story. However, don't expect to be playing along with the movie, the story only loosely ties in with events in the movie, which may be disappointing to some, but don't worry, there are plenty of extra villains you get to see and fight.In addition to the main story-line, the side missions include collecting tokens around the city, trick races, combat tours, bomb tours, and completing random crime missions.

Courtenay TaylorResponseCritical reactions to Spider-Man 3 were, for the most part, quite sour. Despite the past two games critical success, many critics cited a number of unavoidable issues with Spider-Man 3 such as bad interior design and bad boss battles.In their 6.0/10 review IGN noted "If you're desperate for a Spider-Man game, this one fills your need for webs, but other than nailing what web-swinging should feel like, this game is a bust. We were promised a Spidey experience that was next-gen and expanded on everything Spider-Man 2 did right, but we were given a buggy game that's just Spider-Man 2: Special Edition."In their 6.6/10 review, Gamespot also reported "for everything Spider-Man 3 does well, it does something else poorly. The camera and presentation issues, as well as the clumsy combat, all conspire to drag the experience down significantly. Spider-Man 3 isn't without merit, but unless you're one of those die-hard Spider-Man fans that can't get enough of the swinging superhero, there's probably not enough to Spider-Man 3 to make it worth your time."On Metacritic the different versions of the game range from an average score of 50/100 to 68/100. The DS version, however, achieved a rating of 79/100 with mostly positive reviews.UnlockablesPlaystation 3 and Xbox 360Completion bonusesSuccessfully complete the game as Spider-Man to unlock Symbiote Spider-Man's story mode and Arena mode;Successfully complete the game to unlock the Arena mode option in the Extras menu;Collect all 50 Black Spider Tokens to get the black Spider-Man suit to wear whenever desired for as long as you want.Play as the New Goblin (Collector's Edition)Defeat the New Goblin in his first battle to unlock him as a playable character.Playstation 2 and Nintendo WiiCompletion bonuses:Successfully complete the game as Spider-Man to unlock Symbiote Spider-Man's story mode and Arena mode;Collect all 50 Black Spider Tokens to get the black Spider-Man suit to wear whenever desired for as long as you want.Nintendo DSCheat modeSuccessfully complete the game in Story mode.
