This time our yellow friend is eating dots and escaping from evils ghosts in an isometric world wearing a black 'ninja style' blindfold. The game features 4 differently themed worlds that can be played agaijn and again until the player loses all Pac's lives.      Ninja Pac-Man is able to jump and collect various items scattered around the levels:  7650 Dots - you have to get all of them to finish the level.Big Dots - they give Pac-Man a temporary ability to eat his ghost enemies. Use  them wisely as the number is always limited. When Pac uses this boost he can create combos by eating a few ghosts in rapid succession earning up to 7650 points per ghost.Ninja Weapons - (nunchucks, swords, mugs (?) etc.) pick them up for extra points.Special Items - collecting them results in various boosts like inincibility (the 'R' pill) or increase in movement speed (the 'C' pill).  Run for your life!     Each world opens wit a neat and funny cutscene depicting Pac being chased by different types of ghosts and vive versa.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="6332">Ms. Pac-Man</game><game id="1010">Jr. Pac-Man</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/106662/1516033-ninja_pac_man_01.jpg</image></root>
