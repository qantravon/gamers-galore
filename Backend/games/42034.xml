<root><id>42034</id><name>Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter</name><description>You play as Mace Griffin a former space ranger who after being framed and sent to prison has turned to a life of bounty hunting in an attempt to find out what really happened.

The game plays as a standard FPS with a twist. Every now and then you get to pilot different space ships in hectic dog fights. The transitions between the two parts of the game is almost unnoticeable and while you are in space you can even park your ship and have a walk around inside before you get on with your mission.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8719-1.jpg</image></root>
