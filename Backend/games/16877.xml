This allows Magic Knight to examine objects, manipulate them, talk to characters and all the other adventure type actions you would want to perform. Also since the other characters from history are a little bit upset about being dragged from where they belong they need some looking after. Magic Knight has to command them to eat, sleep and be happy in order to help them out, if they die then Magic Knight fails.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20097">Knight Tyme</game><game id="960">Finders Keepers</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1369590-spellbound_mastertronic_2.gif</image></root>
