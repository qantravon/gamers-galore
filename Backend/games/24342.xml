Theoretically, this allows the player to play the game however they wish. Your "Pout" can be  leveled up, while used at a low-level the player can do such things as make a battle more even by using their Pout to make one of the enemies go away.As the Pout is leveled up, it can be used to shape the world in a more effective way. At one of the highest levels the player can completely bypass certain quests by Pouting. However, because pouting is such hard work, the player must rest to use the Pout in such an effective manner again.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="831">Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</game><game id="11278">Magical Starsign</game><game id="22437">Harvest Moon DS Cute</game><game id="24244">Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island</game><game id="24246">Lise no Atelier: Ol'dor no Renkinjutsushi</game><game id="22716">Master of the Monster Lair</game><game id="24394">The Wizard of Oz: Beyond The Yellow Brick Road</game><game id="22803">A Witch's Tale</game><game id="28216">Lina no Atelier: Strahl no Renkinjutsushi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478675-box_mwmw.png</image></root>
