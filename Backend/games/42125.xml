She had an eye patch, a party favor pirate hat and a bone for one arm. A hook attacked to a whip like tentacle formed her other appendage.  Scary girl had been adopted by a giant intelligent octopus and was living? A peaceful life until one day she saw a man in her dreams. This mysterious man haunted her dreams nightly until she finally decided to venture out to find the answers to who this man was.

The story is whimsical and a little twisted (in a good way) perhaps, but it’s just the set up to get you into the wonderful 2D/3D side scroller that is scary girl.  What sets Scary girl apart from the run of the mill platform game is the art direction. The world is vibrant and explodes with color and magic. Very seldom in a game of this type do I slow down to smell the roses and take in the environments but it’s a common occurrence in Scary Girl.  Floating Wisp like creatures, waterfalls and geysers dot the landscape.</description><genres><genre>Platform</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10642-2.jpg</image></root>
