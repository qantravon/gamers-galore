(called Doki Doki Majo Saiban until shortly before release) was released only in Japan on July 5th 2007. According to Amazon, leading up to it's release, pre-orders for the game topped the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass and Final Fantasy Tactics. Despite the reasonable popularity and sales that briefly exceeded the aforementioned releases, SNK has announced that it has no plans to bring the game (or the series) to any region outside Japan. SNK has however, published a sequel titled Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2 DUO.PlotAkuji Nishimura is leading a relatively simple life until one day he gets approached by an angel named Lulu to locate a witch that has infiltrated his school. The witch however, is invisible to the naked eye and resembles any regular human. Thus, Lulu advises to search for "witch marks", which are located somewhere on the subjects body. The desired method to do this is touch. Main CharactersAkuji Nishimura: A junior high student that bloats about being a "bad boy".

Gameplay An artist's vision of regular game play.The gameplay consists of simply finding suspects to examine and interact with. There isn't much to it besides using the stylus to guide Akuji's hands as he searches for the "victim's" witch mark. After being uncovered as a witch, Akuji battles them and if he wins they give up.Popularity and CriticismAn advertisement in a Japanese store exclaiming: "Look! Breasts!"Alot of criticism from various sources has emerged after the game became a fast selling title in Japan. The title became popular after diverse and notorious internet blogs and internet news outlets reported on the game with humor and distaste. This can be attributed to the fact that most characters in the game are particularly well-endowed for their age and have not yet reached the legal age for sexually explicit actions. (It should be noted that this fact differs between regions and that Japan is also different in this regard.) Despite reproach from the American and European audiences, SNK has put large emphasis on the sexuality of the characters in advertisements, marketing and products originating from the game, and it continues to do so with it's sequel, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2 DUO.TriviaThe number of Reverse-Panda's collected at the end of the game unlocks various bonuses including "Extra Episodes" and a "Free Witch Mode" where the player has unlimited time to fondle the game's characters. </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23422">Hayate no Gotoku!
