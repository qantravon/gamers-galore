<root><id>1809</id><name>Logical</name><description>The levels in Logical are all played from a top down - perspective. The goal of the game is to fill a varying number (depends on the level) of gears with coloured marbles. The gears can hold any number of colours but only once it has been filled with marbles in a matching colour, the gear will 'explode'. Once all the gears have been cleared, the level is beaten. The game has a time limit and is throwing many marbles at the player that enter the screen through one or more pipes. The difficulty lies in using all the gears to transport the marbles to their designated destination, while trying to keep the gears in one colour. Later levels in the game featured advanced pipes / effects such as colour changers or transporters.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6618">Boston Bomb Club</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1706162-logical.jpg</image></root>
