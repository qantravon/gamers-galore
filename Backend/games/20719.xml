Played from a top-down, isometric perspective, it is controlled by rolling a trackball to steer your character. The bulk of each stage is spent being chased by various dangerous obstacles such as giant falling icicles, flaming boulders, and unstable, crumbling floors. Players must maneuver one of three characters (Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, or Ray the Flying Squirrel) through oncoming obstacles as quickly as possible in order to stay ahead of whatever is chasing them. Health is measured by an HP meter. Players can replenish their HP meter by collecting rings. Once a stage is over, the player who collected the most rings in that stage is awarded a score bonus.Despite receiving positive critical response from the press at CES 1993, the game was never brought to the United States, and still remains exclusive to Japan to this day.Plot  You'd be running, too. Doctor Eggman has captured Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, and Ray the Flying Squirrel in his giant prison-tank and has hauled them back to his base. When the three break out, they embark on a quest in order to show down with the Doctor and pay him back.LevelsVolcanic VaultIcy IsleDesert DodgeTrap TowerLandslide LimboWild Water WayEggman's TowerTriviaThis game was reportedly slated to be included in  Sonic Gems Collection, but had to be cut due to the difficulty in emulating the trackball interface on controllers that did not normally support it.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16089">Snake Rattle 'n Roll</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/176/200776-segasonic.png</image></root>
