The higher the difficulty, the farther away the trash can is. To add more difficulty, the developers added a fan, to disrupt the ball's flight. The fan changes strength randomly after every toss of the paper ball. The fan also chooses randomly to either blow the ball left or right.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1123830-papertoss1.jpg</image></root>
