This version focuses on single play structure. As the slogan says, this is where the Magical Quest begins. For those unfamiliar with this classic world of fantasy adventure, Talisman is a game like no other â€“ indeed, it is no ordinary game but a fantastic quest in a world of magic and monsters. As you play, a story unfolds from turn to turn: a heroic epic of brave deeds, daring encounters, treasures and magic, of battles won and lost, but always a tale that enthralls!</description><genres><genre>Role-Playing</genre><genre>Strategy</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/16863-1.jpg</image></root>
