The series follows a Japanese schoolgirl who has chosen to fight crime after flaunting the law herself one too many times. Her only notable characteristic, as far as this game is concerned, is the use of a weaponized metal yo-yo to pummel her foes.GameplayThe game is one part brawler, pitting the main character Suki against either a wave of criminals which she must defeat en masse or a single boss with a considerable amount of strength and health. The rest of the game is presented as a first-person adventure game, like Portopia and other text and point and click adventures available for Japanese home computers at the time. The player's actions in one mode generally leads them to the other, as enemies are met in the adventure's story and are then summarily dealt with in the brawler mode.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39838">Sukeban Deka III</game><game id="40635">Sakigake!!
