Then the General phones in and gives you your next mission: a group of terrorists deposited two dirty bombs (normal blasting compositions combined with radioactive material) near the city of Juarez. Your goal as Captain Mitchell is to once again save the day with your three team mates.

Like in the predecessor Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter you control Captain Mitchell and see everything through his eyes while you command your team mates either directly over the Cross-Com or with the help of the tactical map through the various environments to fulfil your objectives like blowing up a bunch of anti-air-vehicles and then raiding a rebel outpost.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/8917-1.jpg</image></root>
