Unfortunately, the City is broiling with social tension as it is ravaged by a plague and lorded over by a political tyrant known as the Baron. In order to survive his adventures, Garrett will have to pay attention to his environment and make use of the many possible paths through each of the game's levels.This game is a reboot of the franchise taking away some of the prominent elements of the previous game's stories such as magic and the Hammerites.It was confirmed by the studio's audio director Jean-Christophe Verbert that voice actor Stephen Russell won't reprise his role as Garrett because the new game is using full motion capture so they can capture the voice at the same time as the actors' movements and facial expressions and therefore needed an actor that can voice Garrett while doing his own stunts.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20669">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</game><game id="21258">Manhunt 2</game><game id="24617">Tenchu: Shadow Assassins</game><game id="21331">Tenchu Z</game><game id="20464">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction</game><game id="22928">Assassin's Creed II</game><game id="35850">Dishonored</game><game id="36172">Remember Me</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2530021-thiefboxart.jpg</image></root>
