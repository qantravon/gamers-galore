The game was released in Japan on February 28, 2008 and was never localized for other territories. However an English fan translation patch was released by DarthNemesis with help from several other translators and hackers on February 2, 2009.GameplaySoma Bringer plays a lot like many Diablo-like action RPGs. You control one character, part of a party of 3, out of 7 choosable characters. You choose your main and only controlable character's class, which can be: Battler, Corp, Dark, Gunner and Kampf.Battler is your usual melee combat fighter, focuses on HP and defense. Corps are spear and one-handed weapons users, balanced between ofense and defense. Darks can equip spears and two-handed weapons, and have HP-using damage-inflicting abilities. Gunners are ranged attackers, have the highest range of attack and can also inflict status changes on enemies. Kampfs are quick hand-to-hand and dual wielding users that excel in combo attaks.Characters level up as they defeat monsters and gain EXP. Once the main character levels up on level the player is prompted to assign Character Points (CP) to increase its statistics. These are Strength, Magic, Health and Skill.Battle GameplayThey player also gains Ability Points (AP) when leveling up, which can be assigned to different abilites and are not permanetly assigned, which means the player can assign all the AP to different abilites as he sees appropriate at different times. However different tiers of abilites are only unlocked when achieving specific levels.The player can then assign different attacks to different buttons, performing combos for more damaged if attacks are executed in the right order. Items can also be assigned to different buttons and can be used in battle accessing a different menu by simply pressing one of the shoulder buttons of the DS. This way the player can easily switch between the attack menu and the item menu during battle.Combat is in real time and enemies appear on the same screen as exploration occurs.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21448">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</game><game id="21444">Tales of Innocence</game><game id="21371">Avalon Code</game><game id="21445">Tales of Hearts</game><game id="21446">Tales of the Tempest</game><game id="23977">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time</game><game id="22015">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</game><game id="9471">Children of Mana</game><game id="24226">Legacy of Ys: Books I &amp; II</game><game id="24225">Destiny Links</game><game id="22044">From the Abyss</game><game id="23516">Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="21486">Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="7060">Lunar Knights</game><game id="22006">Dragon Ball: Origins</game><game id="23777">Phantasy Star Zero</game><game id="24232">Ragnarok DS</game><game id="24307">Steal Princess</game><game id="25152">Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow</game><game id="21636">Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Art</game><game id="27893">Cross Treasures</game><game id="27199">Rune Factory 3: A Fantasy Harvest Moon</game><game id="20615">Summon Night: Twin Age</game><game id="28324">Shounen Kininden Tsumuji</game><game id="11521">Record of Lodoss War</game><game id="29232">Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals</game><game id="25983">Torchlight</game><game id="20803">Diablo III</game><game id="1119">Diablo II</game><game id="15589">Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</game><game id="19703">Darkstone</game><game id="5985">Diablo</game><game id="3247">Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade</game><game id="2603">Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code</game><game id="35479">Heroes of Ruin</game><game id="36093">Legends of Yore</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2214316-943692_97068_front.jpg</image></root>
