Captain Commando has to infiltrate it and find his way to Section-Z to destroy L-Brain, the computer controlling the fortress.GameplaySecton-Z is a side-scrolling game in which the player is a space soldier who can land on the ground and other platform structures and run along them. It is one of the first games which gives players the ability to not only shoot forward, but backwards. It is also one of the first games to give players a choice of paths at the end of each level. Depending on which path they took, they could get special weapons or bombs which wouldn't show up if the other path was taken. To compensate for this, the path without the weapon is often easier. They can activate these special weapons by pressing Select.Sometimes, one of the paths will be flashing red instead of the usual yellow. This indicates that it is impassable unless the player locates and destroys the Generator Boss that is creating the field. Therefore, it is imperative to find the right paths through the fortress to get to the Generator and blow it up. Once this is done, it is possible to safely pass through the red gates and move onto the rest of the area, and eventually, the area boss. Each time a generator is destroyed the player will earn a capsule that increases total HP.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2685">Sol-Feace</game><game id="2764">Abadox: The Deadly Inner War</game><game id="13960">Life Force</game><game id="15508">Gradius</game><game id="4422">Burai Fighter</game><game id="21761">Metroid</game><game id="566">S.C.A.T.: Special Cybernetic Attack Team</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg</image></root>
