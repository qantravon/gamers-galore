<root><id>193</id><name>The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact</name><description>The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact features some of the biggest changes to SNK's annual fighting game franchise. This is the first King of Fighters game to be presented in full polygonal 3D with players having the ability to use inward and outward side steps/rolls to move beyond the 2D plane. Maximum Impact also drops the 3-on-3 team format of earlier King of Fighters games, instead Maximum Impact chooses to have it's story mode battles be 1-on-1 (3-on-3 battles are still available in all other non-story modes). Maximum Impact was followed by a sequel in 2006 but, other than these two games, all other spin-offs and main series King of Fighters games have been 2D.Alternate costumes and new character designs for Maximum Impact and it's sequel were created by Japanese artist Falcoon.CharactersAthena AsamiyaKyo KusanagiClark StillK'Mai ShiranuiTerry BogardSethMaximaIori YagamiYuri SakazakiRalf JonesRyo SakazakiLeonaRock HowardChae Lim (created for Maximum Impact)Alba Meira (created for Maximum Impact)Soiree Meira (created for Maximum Impact)Mignon Beart (created for Maximum Impact)Lien Neville (created for Maximum Impact)Duke (created for Maximum Impact)</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3744">Def Jam: Fight for NY</game><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="16110">Resurrection: Rise 2</game><game id="16793">Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors</game><game id="16172">Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</game><game id="21952">Killer Instinct 2</game><game id="10614">Killer Instinct Gold</game><game id="37073">The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact Regulation A</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2204855-box_kofmi.png</image></root>
