The countdown timer consists of Pac-Man eating a row of dots. Bally-Midway had planned on several versions of the game aimed at different audiences (such as Casinos), and new "packs" of questions regularly. None were ever released.Professor Pac-Man is one of three games (along with Jr. Pac-Man and Pac-Man Plus) that were produced by Bally-Midway (Pac-Man's US distributor) without consent from Namco, thus ending their relationship.Although Professor Pac-Man in this game was just Pac-Man in a mortarboard and glasses, Namco later made him his own character, as Ms. Pac-Man's father.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="33392">Quiz &amp; Dragons</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2413703-prof2.jpg</image></root>
