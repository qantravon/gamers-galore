The player has a limited amount of fuel so the thrusters should be used wisely. The ship can refuel on platforms indicated as fueling stations. To conserve fuel it is best to let gravity take its course and then to thrust upwards before landing to prevent the ship from crashing due to impact.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23095">Lunar Lander</game><game id="24998">Dropship</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1773097-jl.jpg</image></root>
