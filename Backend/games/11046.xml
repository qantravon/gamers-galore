The game has since become a cult classic that is highly praised for deconstructing the conventions and tropes of the Japanese role-playing genre. ASCII had plans to release Moon in the United States and even featured the game prominently at E3 1997 but sadly the released was canceled for undefined reasons. An English translation patch is currently being worked on by SteveMartin and Esperknight at Romhacking dot net.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14945/1095763-moonboxart.jpg</image></root>
