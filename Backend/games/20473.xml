The only tidbits of information they released about the game was that it "will be developed for the next-generation systems and the PC" and "The role playing game will build upon the distinctive look and feel of the original films while utilizing next-generation technology to create an entirely different and unique Alien experience."In February 2009 it was rumored that Obsidian Entertainment laid off more than 20 employees and that the Alien RPG project was canceled. No official word about the projects status has yet been issued by either Sega or Obsidian, but the rumor was confirmed a couple of days later by one of the employees that were laid off.In June 2009 Obsidian confirmed they were no longer working on the project. Sega then released the following statement indicating that the game was completely cancelled:At this point, SEGA has no plans to move forward with the Aliens RPG. The Aliens franchise offers us so much content to choose from that we feel it important to take a step back and carefully consider the type of game we want to release. We plan to continue working with the Aliens franchise and ask fans to be patient and stay tuned for more information about what SEGA has coming out for the Aliens series of games, starting with the upcoming Alien vs. Predator game. We are very excited about and focused on Alien vs. Predator, which promises gamers a fantastic single player game and an equally compelling multiplayer experience. We are confident that it provides all the excitement and fun that the Aliens and Predator fans are looking for!</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg</image></root>
