The fourth and last game in the Bubsy series, the wise-cracking anthropomorphic bobcat (of the same name) must escape the homeworld of aliens known as the Woolies (by collecting rocket parts and defeating the Woolie leaders). The game shifts the franchise from a fast-paced 2D platformer to a slow-moving 3D platformer (known for its awkward controls and low-quality visuals).ReceptionBubsy 3D is notorious for being one of the worst games of all time. The clunky controls, horrible graphics, and annoying one-liners spewed by Bubsy are what gave it this reputation. There's a reason why this was the last game in the Bubsy series.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="609">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="22900">Mort the Chicken</game><game id="24536">Artoon</game><game id="5642">Jersey Devil</game><game id="27562">Disney Epic Mickey</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1796118-box_bubsy3d.png</image></root>
