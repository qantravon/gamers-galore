Mega Man  Bass was nearly identical to the original Super Famicom version. The differences is the perspective was more zoomed in - making the sprites more larger due to the size of the Game Boy Advance screen.  And the music was redone to fit the Game Boy Advance's sound quality. The dialogue was redone too, in the Super Famicom version, Bass was betrayed more cold-blooded; while in the Game Boy Advance game,  he was more sympathetic. The Japanese version is known to have a very hard version of King, the final boss, in his second form. You need lightning power to attack him, but most people would use it on his first form and be out. The difficulty has been fixed.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4350">Contra</game><game id="1257">Blaster Master</game><game id="2190">Gunstar Heroes</game><game id="7860">Bionic Commando</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1810160-box_mmab.png</image></root>
