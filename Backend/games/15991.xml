<root><id>15991</id><name>Chameleon Twist 2</name><description>Chameleon Twist 2 was developed by Japan System Supply and published by Sunsoft and focuses on many of the same gameplay aspects as its predecessor. Yet again, a chameleon named Davey and his friends find themselves trapped in a strange realm that transforms then into a humanoid-chameleon creature. At the beginning of the game, the same mysterious white rabbit that appeared in the first is the cause of all of this, however this time it does not involve traveling into a magical hole. Instead, the rabbit merely knocks one of the chameleons (whichever the player chooses to play as) into the sky, and they suddenly enter the other realm. The player must once again navigate through platform levels in order to achieve his ultimate goal of leaving this realm in the sky, and at the end of each stage is a boss that the player must defeat before moving on. Use of the chameleon's tongue is still necessary for fighting enemies and navigating the levels, and Chameleon Twist 2 also adds a parachute ability, that allows the player to fall at a slower pace, and vertical swinging polls, rather than solely the horizontal poles found in the first game. There is no multiplayer in this game, however.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11371">Gex: Enter the Gecko</game><game id="20330">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</game><game id="1798">Gex</game><game id="11133">Earthworm Jim</game><game id="4434">Earthworm Jim 3D</game><game id="7846">Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy</game><game id="8239">Earthworm Jim 2</game><game id="1334">Super Mario World</game><game id="16094">Super Mario Galaxy</game><game id="2931">Super Mario 64</game><game id="15544">Super Mario Bros.</game><game id="7406">Super Mario Bros. 2</game><game id="12739">Super Paper Mario</game><game id="19060">Sonic Adventure 2</game><game id="4228">Haven: Call of the King</game><game id="7836">Spyro the Dragon</game><game id="1753">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</game><game id="1563">Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage</game><game id="3883">The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning</game><game id="6134">The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night</game><game id="15249">Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy</game><game id="20908">The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon</game><game id="8420">Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly</game><game id="10579">Spyro: Season of Ice</game><game id="12209">Spyro: A Hero's Tail</game><game id="13370">Spyro 2: Season of Flame</game><game id="7380">Crash Bandicoot</game><game id="8660">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</game><game id="12909">Crash Bandicoot: Warped</game><game id="68">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</game><game id="732">Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage</game><game id="355">Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced</game><game id="15212">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</game><game id="18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</game><game id="4966">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</game><game id="4618">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</game><game id="8837">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Size Matters</game><game id="18745">Ratchet: Deadlocked</game><game id="14604">Daxter</game><game id="21000">Secret Agent Clank</game><game id="10384">Jak II</game><game id="14623">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</game><game id="9669">Jak 3</game><game id="15773">LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge</game><game id="11120">LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga</game><game id="20822">LEGO Batman: The Videogame</game><game id="9631">LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy</game><game id="20534">LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/233/335090-us_boxfrunt.jpg</image></root>
