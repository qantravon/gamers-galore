Because the game is now multiplatform it is the first F1 game on the Xbox 360; the first truly next generation F1 game on the PS3 (as the previous F1: Championship Edition game was developed on Playstation 2 hardware) and the first officially licensed F1 game on the PC for over a decade. The PC version of F1 2010 will be a Games for Windows Live game.Previously, Codemasters had announced that this game would be released in 2009 as F1 2009, but this was scrapped and F1 2009 was brought out as a Wii and PSP release.On September 27, 2010 it was announced via the Codemasters' forum that a patch was in process of development and would be released soon.EGO EngineFormula One 2010 is developed on Codemasters own EGO Engine, which has powered other Codemasters racing games such as Colin Mcrae: Dirt 1  DiRT 2 , Race Driver: GRID and the Wii version of F1 2009, as well as other Codemasters developed games like Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising and Bodycount.The EGO engine has been improved specifically for F1 2010, unofficially dubbed 'EGO 1.5'.Teams and DriversFormula One 2010 includes the real life cars and drivers of the 2010 Formula One season, letting you drive any of the 12 teams cars as any of the 24 drivers of the season.

The career mode is similar to that of GRID, where it's based around the experience of being a race driver. Because of this, the career mode emphasizes the importance of out performing your own team-mates like a real F1 driver, as well as racing for team based targets. Beating your team mates will allow you to become more popular and to be seen as a better driver, thus enabling you to move up to better teams as you progress through the career mode.Formula One 2010 features different career lengths that will affect the start of your career:If you choose to do a 3 season career you can choose to start with one of the top teams (McLaren or Ferrari, for example)If you choose to go for a medium long career (5 seasons), you will have to start with one of the smaller teams, though not the worst ones, and try to work your way up to the bigger teams via meeting team objectivesIf you choose to compete in the 7 seasons long career, you'll be assigned to one of the generally considered worst teams on the paddock, thus not being expected for you to win the championship anytime soon. Instead, and just like on the medium long career mode, you're given modest set goals to achieve, something that your bosses feel you can realistically achieve with the car you're currently driving. Meet or surpass the given goals and you'll be able to transfer to a bigger team, and hopefully reach one of the top ones before the 7 seasons go by.MultiplayerFormula One 2010 features online multiplayer on all three platforms; over Xbox Live on the Xbox 360; Play Station Network on the PS3; and through Games for Windows Live on the PC.Real Time Damage and Dynamic Weather EffectsFormula One 2010 features a more advanced simulation of damage than previous racing games. Similar to Codemasters' own DIRT and GRID; damage is calculated in real time, giving a much more naturalistic look to the cars when they are damaged, as well as in how the car will handle when damaged.F1 2010 also features what Codemasters are claiming as the most advanced weather effects of any racing game to date. Like the damage in F1 2010, Weather is also calculated in real time as well as being dynamic. This leads to a much more realistic simulation of how an F1 car handles in the rain around a circuit. Some of the different weather effects the game is calculating are:'Rain' FilterIn-game example of the rain filterWhen racing in the wet in "F1 2010" a filter is applied to the players camera in order to simulate rain that would be hitting the camera or similar to the rain hitting the drivers visor. This will make driving in the wet much more of a challenge than any other racing game as it will be harder to see the track clearly due to the globules and drops of water that block your vision.Procedural WaterA dry line forming due to the games procedural waterStanding water on the track can be dispersed or 'moved' by the car. An example of this in racing is when a 'dry line' is developed by the constant movement of the cars going around the circuit lap after lap; the tires pushing the water away from the contact point of the rubber tire and tarmac surface. This technology is not only aesthetic, but will also affect the handling of the car is a way that is representative of real life racing.Water CoolingStanding water in the game has the ability to cool off your tires. If you are in a situation where your wet tires are gathering too much heat due to a dry line forming, you can drive off-line in the laying water which will cool down the tires to prevent overheating and grip loss.TriviaFormula One test driver Anthony Davidson was the technical adviser for Codemasters for the development of F1 2010. Anthony is an experienced F1 test driver for Honda and Brawn and has also raced in F1 competitively for a small stint in 2007 for Super Aguri. He has also driven competitively for the Peugeot Sport Team in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 12 Hours of Sebring.Official Licensed SoundtrackThe tracklist for the in-game F1 2010 licensed music can be found at the end of the user manual.ArtistSong TitleChase and Status feat.
