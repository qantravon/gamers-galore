Players can now rotate falling blocks with their finger on the front touch screen although, if preferred, a traditional button setup is available. The player's avatar also now comes with special abilities, one set for single-player and another for multiplayer.In addition, the game now employs an experience system to unlock skins rather than the progression methods of the preceding games. It also uses dynamically-lit 3D models for the blocks instead of 2D sprites.DevelopmentThe developers originally pitched the idea for the game as Daft Punk: Lumines, wanting to reboot the franchise. While Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Horem-Christo were interested in the idea, having already appeared in DJ Hero as playable characters, the duo wanted to create all new material and mixes for the games but were unable to as they were already hard at work on the Tron: Legacy soundtrack and what would eventually become Random Access Memories.SoundtrackThe soundtrack includes a wide selection of licensed songs. Q Entertainment described the soundtrack as a "love letter to electronic music".The song list is in order of appearance in the main Voyage mode."The Future of the Future (Stay Gold)" - Deep Dish feat.

In an interview, James Mielke (Producer at Q-Entertainment) explained that this was due to human error. He explained that the team assumed that all retail games automatically had a Platinum Trophy for completing all other Trophy's. In reality, the Trophy has to be manually entered, meaning that Lumines Electronic Symphony shipped without.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="23746">Groovin' Blocks</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2111577-box_lumineses.png</image></root>
