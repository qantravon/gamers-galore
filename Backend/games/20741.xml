This instalment returns to the illegal street racing oriented gameplay that most associate with Need for Speed: Most Wanted.  GameplayNeed for Speed: Undercover utilizes several gameplay mechanics that were the staple of NFS: Most Wanted and NFS: Carbon.    This includes but is not limited to; open worlds, police pursuits, pursuit breakers, nitrous, and of course, street racing. A    Cop dodging action returns to Need for Speed     damage system is present in game, but it is limited to aesthetic damage. The main race modes are circuit racing, sprint races, elimination, time trials and a new highway battle mode. Highway Battle mode is the only mode where a player's car can be totalled. Players have to win races to earn money for various car upgrades, which can be either aesthetic or performance enhancing. They also have to win races and challenges to move forward in the story. Police pursuits once again are based on the player's heat level. The higher the heat level, the tougher the cops get. The Tri-City Police Department consists of regular cop cars, SUV's, helicopters and police cars derived from high performance cars. They will employ tactics such as setting up roadblocks, spike strips, and the PIT manoeuvre.  This instalment of Need for Speed also introduces a levelling system. At the end of a race or event, the player profile has several driving characteristics that experience points are added onto. These different characteristics include braking, top speed and handling. When these skills or characteristics are levelled up, a slightly noticeable increase in performance is seen in all cars the player drives. The multiplayer component of the game includes several game modes: Circuit - A race mode where players have to race each other in a lapped raceSprint - A race mode where players race from a starting point to a finishing pointCops N' Robbers - A game mode where two teams of four either have to deliver or stop the delivery of an itemThe Heist - A game mode where players have to steal cash and evade the police Plot  A member of Tri-City's Underground     Need for Speed: Undercover takes place in Tri-City, which consists of four distinct boroughs. These are Palm Harbor, Sunset Hills, Port Crescent and Gold Coast Mountains. The game begins with the player, an undercover police officer in the police    department's street racing unit, evading cops on the interstate. The player is then introduced to their handler, Det.        Chase Linh. Tri-City is currently a major hotbed of illegal street racing and car smuggling. The player is tasked with infiltrating the criminal underground in order to take down the criminal kingpins. Starting out in the borough of Palm Harbor, the player has to earn the confidence of the local crime boss by stealing and delivering different cars. Once that is done, the player can move onto the other three boroughs to work for other members of the criminal underground, eventually reaching a point where the player can break the case wide open and culminates in a final car chase throughout the Tri-City area. Car List 2006 Aston Martin DB9 2008 Audi R8 2007 Audi TT 2006 Audi RS4 2009 Audi S5 2003 BMW M3 2008 BMW M6 2006 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 1971 Dodge Challenger 2007 Dodge Charger SRT8 2006 Dodge Viper SRT10 1996 Ford Escort Cosworth 2006 Ford Focus ST 2006 Ford GT 2006 Ford Mustang GT 2006 Koenigsegg CCX 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 2006 Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 2008 Lexus IS-F 2006 Lotus Elise 1995 Mazda RX-7 2006 Mazda RX-8 2006 Mazda Speed3 1994 McLaren F1 2008 Mercedes CLS 63 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer EVO IX MR 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer EVO 1989 Nissan 240SX (S13) 2009 Nissan 370Z (Exclusive Debut) 2007 Nissan GT-R (R35) 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34) 2006 Pagani Zonda F 1970 Plymouth Barracuda 1965 Pontiac GTO 2006 Pontiac Solstice GXP 2005 Porsche Carrera GT 2008 Porsche 911 GT2 2006 Porsche 911 GT3 RS 2006 Porsche 911 Turbo 2008 Renault Mugane Coupe 1967 Shelby GT500 2008 Shelby GT500KR 1998 Toyota Supra 2008 VW Scirocco 2006 VW R32 PC System Requirements MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  OS: Windows XP/Vista  CPU: Pentium 4 3.2 Ghz or AMD Athlon 64 3500  RAM: 1GB MB RAM or higher (Windows Vista requires 2 GB RAM)  HDD: 10 GB free disk space or more  Graphics: 256 MB or higher (Pixel Shader 3.0, PCIe only)  DirectX: Version 9.0 c  RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS  OS: Windows XP/Vista  CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo, AMD 64 X2 5200 or AMD Phenom  RAM: 2GB MB RAM or higher (Windows Vista requires 3 GB RAM)  HDD: 10 GB free disk space or more  Graphics: 512 MB or higher (Pixel Shader 3.0, PCIe only)  DirectX: Version 9.0c     SUPPORTED VIDEO CARDS  ATI Radeon  X1600,  X1800,  X1900, HD 2400, HD 2600, HD 2900, HD 3000, HD 4000 Series   NVIDIA GeForce 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 8500, 8600, 8800, 9500, 9600, 9800, 200 Series </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7777">Juiced</game><game id="21307">Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights</game><game id="20729">GRID</game><game id="5648">Burnout Paradise</game><game id="20927">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</game><game id="20418">Midnight Club II</game><game id="2279">Project Gotham Racing 2</game><game id="19809">Project Gotham Racing 3</game><game id="8437">TOCA 2: Touring Car Challenge</game><game id="12950">Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec</game><game id="10124">Midnight Club: Street Racing</game><game id="17872">TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</game><game id="23461">FUEL</game><game id="5881">Forza Motorsport 2</game><game id="17599">Forza Motorsport</game><game id="23526">GTR: Evolution</game><game id="21689">Wangan Midnight</game><game id="1052">Super PickUps</game><game id="25254">Roadsters</game><game id="26054">Cars</game><game id="5875">Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</game><game id="21114">Midnight Club: Los Angeles Remix</game><game id="25485">Test Drive Unlimited 2</game><game id="31634">Driver: San Francisco</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1897547-box_nfsu.png</image></root>
