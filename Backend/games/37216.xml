While the divers will have to discover and recover a treasure or an artefact (hidden in a wreck or similarly hard to access) and return it to their base, the sharks will do everything in their power to prevent from doing just the same. The teams will have different classes / types and the two teams also sport profoundly different ways of playing the game. The sharks for example can pick up sounds and vibrations in the water from a long distance away but suffer from poor eyesight. The game relies on action sequences just as much as on the strategic and efficient use of stealth.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="29886">Dino D-Day</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/2102733-1824311703.jpg</image></root>
