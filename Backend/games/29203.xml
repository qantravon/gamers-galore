<root><id>29203</id><name>Hollywood Squares</name><description>Hollywood Squares is based on the long-running game show and allows two players to play a celebrity and joke-filled version of Tic Tac Toe. Standard stock character models fill out most of the board, while the center square is occupied by one of four celebrities:     Brad Garrett, Kathy Griffin, Jeffrey Tambor, or Martin Mull. Choosing one of them during gameplay triggers full motion video of the celebrity answering a question during an actual Hollywood Squares episode.  Players can unlock new wardrobe options for their players by winning games and bonus rounds.</description><genres><genre id="14">Trivia/Board Game</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26771">The Price is Right 2010</game><game id="31614">Wipeout: The Game</game><game id="988">Jeopardy!</game><game id="28909">Wheel of Fortune</game><game id="26772">Press Your Luck 2010</game><game id="34873">The $1,000,000 Pyramid</game><game id="28360">Family Feud 2010 Edition</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1836587-box_hsquares.png</image></root>
