<root><id>2735</id><name>ZZT</name><description>OverviewZZT was the first game released by Epic Games (which was then called Epic MegaGames). It was developed by Tim Sweeney. The graphics were entirely ASCII-based, which was obsolete even at the time the game was released. However, ZZT sold enough copies to provide funding for Epic's next game, Jill of the Jungle.In addition to being a game, ZZT was also a full game creation system. It included the ability to modify levels and completely reprogram game objects using an integrated scripting language. There is still an active community devoted to building and sharing games using ZZT.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14042">Super ZZT</game><game id="11888">Lost Adventures of Kroz</game><game id="2946">Caverns of Kroz</game><game id="6954">Dungeons of Kroz</game><game id="1640">Return to Kroz</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7001/260443-zzt_000.png</image></root>
