The object of the game is to work your way through all the telefunkers in a level until you find and reach the final one. There are a number of masses of colored blocks scattered around the levels and the player has the ability to pick up a limited number of blocks from underneath them and then place those blocks in front of them at any point in the level, with this ability the player must build structures (usually stair-like in nature) to ascend the levels to reach each telefunker. When the player reaches a telefunker the number of blocks they can carry increases and they have the ability to teleport back to that telefunker at any time by pressing the 0 key. A large gray star also exists in the background of the level at all times to alert the player to where the next telefunker is.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/1198983-polychromaticfunkmonkey_title.jpg</image></root>
