Released on October 25, 2010, it is the fifth entry in the Bit.Tripsaga and sees series protagonist, CommanderVideo, once again being controlled directly by players as they weave through numerous jungles of pixels to stay alive.Gameplay Bit.Trip Fate is much like its predecessor Runnerin that it uses an on-rails style of play. CommanderVideo's movement is limited to back and forth movements along a winding line of light known as "the vibe." The screen also automatically moves along slowly, revealing enemies and obstacles to vanquish, until CommanderVideo eventually encounters a bossat the end of the level. The goal is to get to the end of the level without dying.System RequirementsPCOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 2.0+ GHzMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: OpenGL 2.1 and shader model 3 with 128 MB of memoryDirectXÂ®: 9.0cHard Drive: 100 MB HD spaceSound: Any sound card capable of stereo outputAdditional: Playing with a keyboard and mouse is recommended.MacOS: OSX version Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or laterProcessor: 2.0+ GHzMemory: 512 MB RAMGraphics: Open GL 2.1 and shader model 3 with 128 MB of memoryHard Drive: 100 MB HD spaceSound: Any sound card capable of stereo outputAdditional: Playing with a keyboard and mouse is recommended.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="40838">escapeVektor</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/976/1477120-bittripfate1.png</image></root>
