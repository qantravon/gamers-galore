Upon its release it was included with this professional target shooting simulator that allowed the player to shoot down clay pigeons (in Trap Shooting) and moving cardboard silhouette targets (in Marksman Shooting). The two games superficially resembled Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley respectively.In the European-only mode Safari Hunt, the player could also shoot wild animals as they move across the screen. The creatures ranged from small fish and rabbits to larger beasts like bears, which required more than one shot to defeat. Defeated animals, rather than simply dying, tended to run off the screen with crosses through them to indicate they had been hit.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2758">Duck Hunt</game><game id="6490">Hogan's Alley</game><game id="26429">Cabela's Big Game Hunter</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/2022048-256px_marksman_trap.jpg</image></root>
