You receive instructions from your boss from time to time, but lately he's been absent and there are no apartment occupants to speak with as well. Sensing something strange, Robert must explore the building to figure out what's going on and how he's to escape from this nightmarish place.DevelopmentTeam Other team members aside from Rick include Jesse Maccabe (environment artist), Sergi Lluch (modelling), Julio Iglesias (concept artist) and Robert Brown (concept artist and 3D modeller, worked on   FEAR 3).SettingOn the idea of the Soviet-era style building,   Rick Nieuwlaat was inspired by the never-finished Ryugyong Hotel in North Korea.
