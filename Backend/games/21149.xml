The god/player can also shape the landscape of the the game to make an advantageous living space for his people and must eventually defeat an enemy population that is led by an enemy god. Over the course of the game, the player will rule over multiple stages of civilizations, from prehistoric to medieval.LegacyIn addition to spawning a combat focused sequel called "Powermonger", Populous can be considered the original God game. Aside from Black and White, which like Populous  was designed by Peter Molyneux, games such as Spore, From Dust and The Sims were inspired by Populous's style of gameplay where the player serves as some all-powerful force that is responsible for a group of people and their living space. </description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20960">SimCity Creator</game><game id="20580">Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution</game><game id="12474">Black &amp; White 2</game><game id="4736">SimCity 4</game><game id="18443">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</game><game id="15035">SimCity</game><game id="1628">SimCity Societies</game><game id="10616">Streets of SimCity</game><game id="14865">SimCity 4: Rush Hour</game><game id="13760">SimCity 2000</game><game id="2473">The Sims 2</game><game id="18623">Black &amp; White</game><game id="31722">From Dust</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2484709-box_pds.png</image></root>
