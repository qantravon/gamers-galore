It was a great game for those of us that wanted to manage the games, rather than "play" them in action mode status. It spawned several sequels through the early 1990's but disappeared from the scene by mid-decade.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/2260115-microleaguebaseball.jpg</image></root>
