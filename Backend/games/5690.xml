The revolvers only shoot one bullet at a time, but the bullets fire at a faster rate.Players move on a 2D plane while being able to aim and shoot in eight directions. Some stages have two planes, an upper plane and a lower plane, that they are able to jump back and forth. Most stages pits the players going through a stage battling enemies and course obstacles until the reach the end of the level, where the stage boss awaits. Some bosses have henchmen assisting them, making the boss battle more difficult for the players to contend. Once the boss is defeated, the player is awarded the bounty on the targeted outlaw. If two players are present when the boss is defeated, the bounty is awarded to the player who hit the boss the most.Watch out for that log!There are three stages out of the eight that differ from the other five where the players walk and battle their way to the end boss.Stages 2  7: These two stages puts the bounty hunters riding on horses throughout the stage until they reach the boss at the end of the level. The players stay on one plane and navigate the level by battling enemies that ride horses along the bottom of the screen along with a wagon where an enemy tosses logs from the back of it to trip the hunters off of their horses.Stage 4: The fourth stage is fought inside a saloon where the bosses stand on balconies at both sides of the stage with a huge chandelier hanging in the middle of the stage.Power-UpsSunset Riders features the following power-ups to assist the player in battling enemies in the Wild West.Rapid Fire: Increases the character's bullet firing rate.Dual Fire: Gives the character a second weapon.

Genesis VersionThe Sega Genesis version of the game is considerably different from the Arcade and SNES port. Only Billy and Cormano are available to play in this version with four stages that have two parts. The first half ends with the character(s) rescuing a tied up damsel in distress, while the second half ends on a boss battle.The four bosses in this version of Sunset Riders are Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, Chief Scalpem, and Sir Richard Rose. Most of these bosses are similar to their Arcade and SNES counterparts, with the only difference being the Paco Loco fight, which takes place on a train.The Genesis's bonus stage also differs from the Arcade/SNES version. Within the four stages, players can shoot objects that may yield a sheriff's star for a limited time on screen. If the player collects this star they get to participate in a bonus stage for extra lives and money. The bonus stage pits the character riding on a horse chasing after weaving stage couch where someone in the back hurls these prizes towards you. The player can collect more than one star per level, but the bonus stage can only be done once. If two players are playing, each player must get their own star or risk being left out of the bonus level.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</game><game id="1201">Wild Guns</game><game id="15361">Gun.Smoke</game><game id="22875">Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa</game><game id="30584">Mystic Warriors</game><game id="10077">Super C</game><game id="40638">Big Challenge!
