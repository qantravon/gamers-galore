Acid Drop is a puzzle game that plays exactly like    Sega's     Columns, with the only difference being that stacking blocks diagonally won't work. Before the game begins, you are given the option to choose from difficulty level 1-30, with each level increasing in speed. The main objective is to stack three of the same coloured blocks either vertically or horizontally, if the blocks reach the top of the screen, then it's   game over. Trivia Acid Drop was the very last game released for the  Atari 2600 and is extremely rare to find. During gameplay, Beethoven's     Fur Elise plays in the background.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1896">Tetris</game><game id="5487">Columns</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/633494-b_aciddrop_front.jpg</image></root>
