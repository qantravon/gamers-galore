<root><id>6567</id><name>Master of Magic</name><description>The hero of this adventure / rogue-like game is young lad who is teleported into a maze full of creepy denizens and easy ways to die and the only way out is to find a magical amulet. The gamescreen is divided into three sections. An overhead map (hence the similarity to rogue-like games), a scroll that tells the player what is going on in the gameworld, in particular during fights, as well as the lower part of the screen that shows enemies and items in the proximity of the hero.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9408/744767-master_of_magic.jpg</image></root>
