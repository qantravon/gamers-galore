It was developed by EA Sports Big and published by EA. Like the other games in this series, it is a cartoonish take on street basketball.Game PlayThe object of the game is to score points, just like in real basketball. The majority of games go to 21, with the winner having to win by at least 2 points. Unlike most real street basketball the full-court is usually used for play. Players have a limited turbo meter that allows them to perform tricks, trick counters, dunks, and trick blocks. The more stylish you are the more trick points you accumulate. If a player accumulates enough trick points they can activate a gamebreaker. A gamebreaker is a special shot that is worth the same as a normal shot, but takes away a point from your opponent.Game ModesPick Up GameThe exhibition mode in the game.
