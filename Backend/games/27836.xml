<root><id>27836</id><name>BitStream</name><description>OverviewBitStream puts you in control of a colored line and tasks you with guiding it around obstacles and to the finish. Gameplay   Use the left analog stick to steer your line around the obstacles. Keep the line going straight as much as possible as turning decreases your speed. Hit boost arrows to temporarily gain speed. These arrows are often placed among obstacles which means the player may risk colliding with them in order to gain the speed. Collision with an obstacle does not result in a "crash" but instead merely slows the lines forward progress significantly. Avoid collisions and hit as many boost arrows as possible to come out on top.
