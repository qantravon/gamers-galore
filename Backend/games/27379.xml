It’s also charity ware, so if your reading this and seem interested then download for free now. It’s a traditional platformer in so much as you move left and right, and jump. Apart from when you fly. It’s also reasonably traditional that you fire with your left mouse button. Except that you shoot at the glum shadows to bring them to brighter life. Then with your completely atraditional right mouse button, you place three points of a triangle which captures a creature within it, seemingly grabbing its essence and opening portals. Until that’s not what the game’s about, and you’re flicking red and blue switches to change level patterns, and climbing on grasshoppers’ backs, and flinging yourself into the air using special whirlythings.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3817/1082665-glum_buster.jpg</image></root>
