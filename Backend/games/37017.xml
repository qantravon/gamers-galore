The series' iconic adversaries - the Daleks, Cybermen, the Silence among others makes their appearance in the game, and there's a co-op mode where one player will play as the Doctor and the other will play as River.ReceptionThe game wasn't well received, while some reviewers saw good intentions and some promise that future entries in the series could be interesting, The Eternity Clock is marred with technical issues and visuals that don't work well on the 2D plane, it currently ranked at 39/100 on Metacritic.System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7  8Processor: Intel Core Duo 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 4800+Memory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT 512 MB or ATi Radeon HD 3850 512 MBHard Drive: 1.7 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX compliant sound cardRecommendedOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7  8Processor: Intel or AMD dual-core 2.5 GHzMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 570 or AMD Radeon HD 6970Hard Drive: 1.7 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX compliant sound card</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7042">Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project</game><game id="30622">Doctor Who: City of the Daleks</game><game id="37171">Doctor Who Episode 5: The Gunpowder Plot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2340137-doctor.png</image></root>
