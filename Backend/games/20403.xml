<root><id>20403</id><name>Dance Factory</name><description>Dance Factory is a rhythm game similar to the Dance Dance Revolution series. Players hit the arrows on the mat that corresponds to the ones on screen. In addition to that, you can also put your own CDs in and dance to your own music. The game generates dance moves based on the beat of the song. You can also create your own dance chart for your songs if you choose. There are also multiplayer up to 16 people in tournament mode.  The game is heavily focused on inputing your own music in the game. Though critic's praised the idea, it was not well executed. The game would not generate the dance steps properly, resulting in negative reviews.</description><genres><genre id="19">Music/Rhythm</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20630">Dance Dance Revolution X</game><game id="1417">DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution</game><game id="3118">DDRMAX 2 Dance Dance Revolution</game><game id="20629">Dance Dance Revolution UNIVERSE 3</game><game id="11694">Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA</game><game id="21746">Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2</game><game id="16639">Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</game><game id="20631">Dance Dance Revolution HOTTEST PARTY 2</game><game id="18104">Dance Dance Revolution Disney MIX</game><game id="20714">Rock Band 2</game><game id="24711">Guitar Hero 5</game><game id="20673">Guitar Hero World Tour</game><game id="25536">Guitar Hero: Van Halen</game><game id="25521">Guitar Hero: Smash Hits</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9261/294131-dance_factory.jpg</image></root>
