Users can use a separate tool on the disc Anime Maker to design and import their own 2D sprites into their game. Design elements are limited to altering sprite attributes to determine attack, skills, magic power, and other RPG tropes. In addition to this a layer of events can be added that have a variety of effects, including background music, decision trees, shop dialogues and more. The battle system is random with enemy parameters tied to specific battle areas. In addition to these predetermined encounters can be triggered with the event system.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="25377">Fighter Maker</game><game id="17178">RPG Maker 3</game><game id="30488">Sleep Is Death</game><game id="27640">Fighter Maker 2</game><game id="18799">Princess Maker: Legend of Another World</game><game id="35956">Dezaemon Plus</game><game id="42385">RPG Tsukuru 4</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2243876-box_rpgm.png</image></root>
