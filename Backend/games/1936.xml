GameplayPlayers controlled a clown mounted on one end of a seesaw. At the start of the game, another clown comes from the side of the screen. The second clown lands on the other end of the seesaw, which propels the first clown into the air.

Players are able to flip the seesaw around by clicking the paddle's fire button.Players are offered 8 different types of game variations. ControllersBecause of the nature in which the seesaw moves, players must use paddle controllers.  Paddle controllers</description><genres><genre id="45">Block-Breaking</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13049">Breakout</game><game id="1564">Clowns</game><game id="1055">Super Breakout</game><game id="11710">Off the Wall</game><game id="9856">Fireball</game><game id="13517">Clowns &amp; Balloons</game><game id="30668">Brickyard/Clowns</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367688-a2600_circusatari.jpg</image></root>
