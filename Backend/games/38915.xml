Players control a long haired blond cyborg in his quest to defeat aliens.StoryThe player controls a teenage cyborg only known as Biomech. His task is to push back the invading alien forces threatening a futuristic earth. His quest begins at the last bastion of human resistance nestled in the forest. Fighting endless hordes of aliens with any weapons found, he must infiltrate each of the four "realms" now under alien control. His only hope in saving earth is in defeating the leader of the aliens residing in a battle ship orbiting earth.GameplayThe player has a wide array of weapons that are found within levels however only two weapons can be help at once. All weapons have ammunition except for Biomechs starting pistol. Ammunition can be acquired by either collecting another instance of a weapon or by shooting yellow crystals commonly found throughout the game. The player can collect shield symbols to increase health as well as a power-up providing temporary invulnerability.

A common strategy is to acquire the AD350 "heat-seeking" gun and simply shoot straight up, while avoiding enemy fire. This allows the player to focus solely of the platforming aspects of the game. The LC-30 is often saved for boss encounters as it is the highest damage weapon with a constant stream of fire.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/158335/2257740-realm101.jpg</image></root>
