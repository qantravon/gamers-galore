<root><id>20451</id><name>MotorStorm: Pacific Rift</name><description>OverviewMarking a shift from the dusty desert terrain found in the original MotorStorm, Pacific Rift takes place in a vibrant tropical island. The players race across the various terrain in this tropical paradise as they deal with the environment as well as rival racers. Mud, undergrowth, vines, trees, lava pools, rivers and lakes will all stand in the way of the goal. These elements will affect the gameplay in different ways, depending on the size of the vehicle. While smaller, lighter vehicles will get slowed by vines and branches, the newly added monster trucks can just plow through such obstacles. Bodies of water will also play a role as they can cool down engines, though they will also slow down the player's vehicle, and venturing into water that's too deep can be catastrophic. The game features four-player split-screen support, as well as 20-player online play. The online servers will be shut down on October 1st, 2012.Vehicle TypesHere are all the vehicle types in MotorStorm Pacific Rift, including the new addition, the Monster Truck.BikeATVBuggyRally CarRacing TruckMudpluggerBig RigMonster TruckThe Four ZonesThis time, the MotorStorm festival takes place across four distinct, themed zones on The Island, providing 16 varied tracks in all.Fire Zone: "Situated deep within The Island's volcanic lava fields, the Fire Zone is full of red-hot dangers forged in natures crucible. Prepare to speed across fiery racetracks characterized by rocky wastelands are creeping sheets of lava."Air Zone: "High above the tropical treeline stands the Air Zone, featuring racetracks on sheer cliff edges, fast downhill runs and massive big-air jumps. Lighter vehicles will profit from more control in this landscape - but a Big Rig is just as good for sending opponents crashing into the void."Earth Zone: "Dense and dirty, the Earth Zone throws racers deep into The Island's thick jungles and forests. Routes in and around the heavy undergrowth are littered with hazards and visibility is often minimal. You'll need to think fast and make split-second decisions to avoid a mass of deadly obstacles!"Water Zone: "From mountain lakes to coastal shores, the Water Zone offers serene beaches, plunging waterfalls and treacherous river canyons. Racetracks are often dangerously narrow as they cut a path through flowing water, so be on the lookout for alternative routes that will lead to dry land."Often, tracks will have a blend of "zones" so, certain Air tracks will contain lava featured in Fire tracks, and certain Water tracks will have dense jungle and mud seen in Earth tracks etc. This helps prevent the zone's from feeling too sperated and gives The Island, a more natural life-like feel.SoundtrackAlex Metric - In Your MachineAmon Tobin - Trickstep (Pacific Rift Mix)Animal Alpha - Fire!
