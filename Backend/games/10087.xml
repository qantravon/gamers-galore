The game is seen as revolutionary for its popularization of sprite based, pseudo-3D graphics. It was one of the first games to use the "rear-view racer format" that would change the way in which racing games were developed. Pole Position was also one of the first games to feature in-game advertising. It was also the first ever 16-bit video game, utilizing two 16/32-bit Zilog Z8002 processors.When looking for a publisher in the United States, Namco originally approached Midway with a choice between two games, Pole Position or Mappy. Midway chose Mappy and Namco turned to Atari to publish the game. Midway would miss out on a large opportunity as Pole Position became one of the most popular arcade games of 80s and was ported to an assortment of different consoles. The game even spawned its own Saturday morning cartoon show on CBS. </description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11570">Hang-On</game><game id="2386">Rad Racer</game><game id="7258">Hard Drivin'</game><game id="18177">Turbo</game><game id="13617">Night Driver</game><game id="18397">Burning Rubber</game><game id="17447">Full Throttle Racing</game><game id="22442">F1 ROC: Race of Champions</game><game id="11336">Vroom</game><game id="12786">Checkered Flag</game><game id="20203">World Grand Prix</game><game id="14919">Grand Prix Challenge</game><game id="34585">Speedway/Tag</game><game id="14201">F-1 Spirit: 3D Special</game><game id="37933">Lemans</game><game id="37092">Final Lap</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366215-a5200_poleposition.jpg</image></root>
