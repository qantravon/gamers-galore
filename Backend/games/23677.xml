Gameplay stresses exploration, discovery, narrative, and even introspection by the player and the player's character.The story of the game draws heavilly on the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The player begins by choosing from six playable sisters, each in very different stages of life: Robin, Rose, Ginger, Ruby, Carmen, and Scarlet. The player must then make their way to Grandmother's house, guided by a forest path. Following the path results in an uneventful "good ending", and a quick close to the game, but deviating from the path and exploring the dark forest reveals many secrets.AwardsAt the 2008 Independent Games Festival The Path was nominated for the Excellence in Visuals Arts award.
