<root><id>17694</id><name>Dustin</name><description>Dustin is an "escape from Alcatraz" style game for the Sinclair Spectrum. The player controls a convict who must bust his way out of prison and escape from the island. In order to do this the player must beat up prison guards collect/ steal/ barter various items around the prison grounds. The HUD has 8 inventory slots, an alert meter to show whether the guards are on the convicts trail, a clock to show the time of day and an energy meter.Dustin involves a lot of point-and-click adventure style trial and error gameplay as the convict needs to collect various items in a certain order and then use them in the right places. One of the games difficulties was in finding out whereabouts to go around the prison since a lot of the screens where identical to each other. Dustin is a more primitive version of games like The Great Escape and is part of the legacy of prison break themed titles.   </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10334">The Great Escape</game><game id="18130">Alcatraz: Prison Escape</game><game id="14949">Alcatraz</game><game id="9917">P.O.W.: Prisoners of War</game><game id="13142">Prisoner of War</game><game id="8848">Great Escape</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13636/510814-dustin.jpg</image></root>
