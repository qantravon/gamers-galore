It featured an ability to save your character to continue later.The game-play featured a single hero wandering around a dungeon killing monsters with a variety of spells to level up as well as collecting treasure.The game was called pedit5 as a reference to the editing tools on the PLATO interface, but was deleted shortly after it was discovered, as making games out of the system was frowned upon. However, it inspired the development of more complicated versions of the game to be made in tribute; Orthanc and Orthanc1, named after a tower in The Lord of the Rings.The game is credited with various firsts in gaming history, including: health, melee, NPCs, experience points, and hit points.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58094/1343262-69054.jpg</image></root>
