In fact 60 people managed to do so and so a special version of the game was made and a play off was held for the prize.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/62571/1364442-gyron_front.jpg</image></root>
