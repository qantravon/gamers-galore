<root><id>38128</id><name>Zaga-33</name><description>Zaga-33 started off as Michael Brough's contribution to the 7 day Roguelike Game Jam in 2012, in which developers - as the title implies - have to create a working Roguelike in 7 days. After the competition he continued development and released the game for free on PC and Mac, with a payed version for iOS devices.Unlike most other Roguelikes, Zaga-33 has no experience system and no regenerating health, making it much more about surviving by avoiding combat than other games in the genre, instead having the player focus solely on getting as deep into the dungeon as possible while not engaging monsters.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>NONE</image></root>
