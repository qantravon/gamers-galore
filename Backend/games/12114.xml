<root><id>12114</id><name>Jetstrike</name><description>Jetstrike is a side scrolling flight game in which you have to take on the evil and tyranical SPUDD who intend to rule the earth. The controls in jetstrike although initially frustrating bring the game a great sense of satisfaction once you have cracked them. The game offers 100 missions broken up into different mission typesÂ  from bombing runs, to complicated dogfights, carrier landings and personnel drops. JETSTRIKE also features helicopters which is odd considering the name of the game and although they were easier to fly than jets they stood little to no chance of surviving a dogfight with a jet. Much like reality.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1874">Wings of Fury</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/294664-jetstrike_back.jpg</image></root>
