<root><id>14074</id><name>Walter Payton Football</name><description>OverviewWalter Payton Football is a football sim developed and published by Sega entirely for the western market. Sega had ceased to support the Sega Master System back in Japan, choosing instead to focus on the Sega Genesis. In Europe, the game is called American Pro Football and has all instances of Walter Payton removed.As with most Football games, the developers did not have the license to use the actual teams, so simply the names of the cities are used instead. Walter Payton appears on the title screen and box art as well as, curiously enough, on the coin used for the coin toss, but not elsewhere.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="21">Football</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="98">John Elway's Quarterback</game><game id="396">Reggie Jackson Baseball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375676-walter_payton_football_sms_us.jpg</image></root>
