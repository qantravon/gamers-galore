<root><id>31806</id><name>Pix'n Love Rush</name><description>Pix'n Love Rush is a 2D platform game with retro style pixel graphics developed jointly by  Bulkypix, Pastagames, and video game historians Pix'n Love. The game has two modes of play, a five minute mode and an infinite mode.  In either mode, the goal of Pix'n Love Rush is to collect coins to increase your multiplier while avoiding obstacles that slowly chip away at your life or decrease your multiplier (or both).  As you increase your multiplier from 2x, 5x, and 10x, the visuals and audio change themes.  As the visuals change, retro gamers should be able to identify the different styles throughout the levels (think Gameboy and Virtualboy).  There is a minor "shooting" mechanic where your character can fire projectiles up in the air at bat-like creatures.  Getting rid of these enemies will also increase your score and multiplier.  The shooting mechanic is a "risk/reward" mechanic in that your projectiles can also hurt you.  The tagline "Move, Jump, and shoot" pretty much sums up the gameplay.  Like many games of the past, controls are simple enough.  By your left thumb, left and right arrows will move you... left and right.  On your right thumb you will find the jump and shoot mechanic.  Controls seem tight and responsive. The game costs 99 cents and is available for download from the iTunes app store.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="29446">Arkedo Series - 03 PIXEL!</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/61990/1408048-iphone_screenshot_2.jpg</image></root>
