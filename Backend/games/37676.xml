In Omerta, players take the role of an up-and-comer in the criminal underworld of Atlantic City in the 1920s who will struggle to build a crime empire that dominates the entire region. To this end, players will need to make business decisions to grow their criminal enterprise, manage pressure from law enforcement and politicians, and recruit henchmen to carry out assassination missions, warehouse raids, prison breaks, bank robberies, and gang turf wars.GameplayThe gameplay will blend the strategic empire building of a game like Tropico with the tactical turn-based RPG combat of a game like X-Com. The game will have a real-time strategic layer in which players make macro-management decisions such as how to spend resources and which missions to send henchmen on, as well as a turn-based tactical layer in which players will control and issue commands to individual henchmen as they carry out their mission. The turn-based combat will feature stealth and cover mechanics. Henchmen will gain experience points and can be equipped with gear, allowing them to be customized to players' wishes.Omerta will also feature both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.
