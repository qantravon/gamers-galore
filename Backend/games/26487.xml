Multiplayer  The original 2009 release of Order of War did not come packaged with a multiplayer, however in March 2010 a stand-alone multiplayer known as    Order of War: Challenge was released as a digital download on   Steam, in order to maximize profits from the game, essentially the PC equivalent of charging for "DLC" that's already on the disc.System Requirements Minimum:OS: Windows® XP SP2/Windows Vista SP1/Windows 7  Processor: 3.0 GHz, DUO 2.0 GHz  Memory: 2 GB  Graphics: 256MB NVIDIA GeForce 7600/Radeon HD2400  DirectX®: DirectX® 9.0c  Hard Drive: 10 GB free space  Recommended:OS: Windows® XP SP2/Windows Vista SP1/Windows 7  Processor: DUO 3.2 GHz or better  Memory: 3 GB or better  Graphics: 512MB GeForce 9800/Radeon HD4850 or better  DirectX®: DirectX® 9.0c  Hard Drive: 10 GB free space  Note: Increased performance will be noticed on an Alienware  Area 51® X58 Desktop </description><genres><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18930">Company of Heroes</game><game id="24362">Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor</game><game id="4750">Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts</game><game id="3094">Close Combat Trilogy</game><game id="30160">War Leaders: Clash of Nations</game><game id="20195">War Front: Turning Point</game><game id="30367">Order of War: Challenge</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9039/1142664-orderofwarpc.jpg</image></root>
