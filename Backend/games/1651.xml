Jiménez.  Pac-Gal, which was later re-released as "Pac-Girl," is his only known game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7624">Pac-Man</game><game id="15304">Oh Shit!</game><game id="24311">Bounce Out</game><game id="23549">Devil World</game><game id="5863">PacDoom III: Halloween Party</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7001/382549-pacgal_001.png</image></root>
