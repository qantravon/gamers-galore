<root><id>18255</id><name>The BIGS</name><description>The BIGS is an action style baseball game that may seem similar to Midway's Slugfest series, and indeed it is. There aren't many modes in The BIGS, there is a career mode where you take your rookie from the start of the season to the end of the season. There is a very addicting Baseball Pinball mode where you choose a power hitter from the MLB and you take him to the middle of Times Sqaure and you just hit stuff with the ball that is pitched to you. The smaller the object you hit, the bigger the points you get. The difficulty also changes as you keep rising in your score where they add different pitches like curveballs, changeups, etc. There is also an online component that is very basic. You and a friend or random oppenent just meet up and get a game going. The BIGS is an action style baseball game where there are insane pitches and all the guys in the game are juiced with steriods. A nice break from all the realistic baseball games.  Check it out for almost any system available.   Soundtrack  Stone Temple Pilots - PlushScreaming Trees - Nearly Lost YouJane’s Addiction - Ocean SizeKilling Joke - MillenniumRollins Band - TearingWhite Zombie - More Human than HumanMidnight Oil - DreamworldFu Manchu - Hung out to DryMotorhead - Ace of SpadesThe Stooges - Down On The StreetPrimus - Jerry Was A Racecar DriverBlue October - SomebodySatellite Party - Insanity RainsHighbench - Satisfied </description><genres><genre id="34">Baseball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5811">Baseball Stars</game><game id="4646">MLB Slugfest 2006</game><game id="4166">Blitz: The League</game><game id="6304">MLB SlugFest 20-04</game><game id="8417">NFL Blitz</game><game id="18355">MLB SlugFest 20-03</game><game id="36048">Nicktoons MLB</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png</image></root>
