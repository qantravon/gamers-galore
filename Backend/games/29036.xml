<root><id>29036</id><name>Fist of the North Star:  Ken's Rage</name><description>OverviewFist of the North Star: Ken's Rage (known in Japan as Hokuto Musou) is a third-person action brawler developed by Omega Force and published by Tecmo Koei for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on November 2, 2010. Based on the anime and manga series Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is a large-scale brawler in the same vein as KOEI's Musou series.Players take control of a number of heroes and villains from the series, fighting through hordes of enemies in either Legend Mode (storylines faithful to the original franchise's story), Dream Mode (original storylines featuring more playable characters), and Challenge Mode (which pits players against a continuous stream of opponents).GameplayFist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is a beat'em up that pits the player character against hordes of enemies.Every character has a health gauge, a spirit gauge and a focus gauge. The health bar is shown as a green bar and if that bar is empty, it'll be game over.Basic AttacksThere are two buttons for attacking, normal attack and strong attack. The normal attack is used to create a chain of combos whilst the Strong Attack is used to follow up on a normal attack. So this can be experimented on by doing (Normal, Strong) (Normal, Normal, Strong) and by doing so, different types of attacks can be made. If timed, itâ€™s possible to also link the combos together. For example, Kenshiro can do (Normal, Strong) which acts as a launcher, this can then be followed up with another combo; it's just like juggling an opponent in a fighting game.Each character can throw and there are three types of throwing. Normal Throw, Strong Throw or Running Throw (some characters can perform this one). The Running Throw is prefect for crowd control.Taunting is good as a mechanic (and not just to mock the thugs) as upon using it, any surrounding lower thugs would jump in a circle in front of the character ready to attack but also making it super-useful to use combos or Signature Moves. However using it a lot would make some enemies much strong shown as yellow sparks.Meridian ShockMeridian Shock is a good way to stun the opponents which is shown as electrical charges surrounding them. Once they're in that state, their defense is lowered causing additional attacks to be stronger. Also it's a good way to stop them in their tracks and throw them. Different upgrades can perform status ailments once in Meridian Shock like for example Poison which drains the opponent's life. The more consecutive attacks are performed, the more likely they will be shocked. Some combos like using any of the Nanto guys will be shocked once entering their own special mode. For the ranged fighters like Mamiya or Jagi, their weapons can also shock them.There is a kill counter shown at the bottom left hand corner of the screen and it only shows up once the kill has been made.The GaugesHealth GaugeThis is the player's health bar. As the player's health drops health from being attacked, the players clothes are torn off. It can be recovered by picking up health items.Spirit GaugeSpirit GaugeThe Spirit gauge gets filled as enemies get beaten shown as a orange/yellow bar. Once filled, it adds 1 bar meaning that a Signature Move can be used. Items can also be used to boost this gauge.Signature Moves can use between 1-3 bars depending on which move is being used. It is also best to use these if the character is in danger as it also grants invincibility as no opponent can touch the character. Up to four Signature Moves can be equipped via the D-Pad to quickly switch moves. Signature Moves can be bought by paying for them with Skill Points.Focus GaugeFocus GaugeThe Focus Gauge shown on the left of the gauges in the form of a semi-circle also gets filled up like the Spirit Gauge but it is used differently. However, that gauge can also be dropped if attacked repeatedly like when enemy performs a signature move on the character and if burned by a flamethrower. It can be filled up to three bars and can be quickly built up by: smacking thugs into walls or objects getting a "Smash Bonus" and receiving bonuses for certain missions.The Spirit Aura uses the Focus Gauge once it is activated. An aura will shine on the character and if there are any enemies surrounding that character, they will be temporarily stunned. Upon activation, it grants a boost of strength as well as different versions of the moves itself. Once activated, it consumes any bars left and it is converted into time so the more bars are filled the more time can be added in this mode.The Hyper Signature move can only be used during activation of the Spirit Aura, it grants access to some extra Signature Moves, designed to instantly kill the opponent(s). The more bars are filled, the more wider the attack can be i.e. Level 1 is used to attack 1 opponent, whilst Level 2 and 3 reaches out as an Area of Attack.Karma Points GaugeUpon defeating enemies (or objects), karma points shown as blue orbs are automatically collected which is the equivalent of experience points. The default is 150 and after reaching 150, the character receives skill points which are used to spend on points in the Meridian Chart. Some upgrades can be used to use to their advantage as upon leveling up, attributes can be increased in game either on health, defense or power.Battle ResultsOnce a stage is complete a battle results page shows up on the screen displaying stats after completing a stage and shows a grade for how good the player completed the level. It shows the following:Skill points obtainedBy performing well in the stages, additional skill points are obtainable by completing bonusesBattle - This is the total number of skill points obtained in the stage.Scenario Bonus - Bonus skill points are given for leveling up the character or finding bottles that level the player up.Critical Hit Bonus - If the correct signature move hits the boss, the player gets an additional 35 skill points.Harbinger of Death Bonus - If all the scenario stages are complete, this bonus is rewarded which is worth 45 points.Overall RatingThis section grades the player based on how well they did on each section.Mission Bonus - As represented by the 7 stars, this shows how many missions have been completed.Damage Taken - Makes a record on how damaged the play got during the stage (Collecting health items does not affect the grade).Kill Count - This shows how many enemies the player has killed and the kill counter is always shown during the game.Signature Move Kills - Shows how many times a signature move has been performed in the game.CharactersThe following characters are playable in the game:Hokuto TypeKenshiroTokiJagiRaohNanto TypeReiShinSoutherSpecial TypeMamiyaOutlaw (As DLC)Mr Heart (as DLC)These characters appear in the game:BartLynnYuriaAiriZeedBoss FangAmibaWigul (Uigur)Yuda (Juda)Shuu (Shew)RyuugaFudoJuuzaGiant HagModes of PlayThere are two basic modes of play in Ken's Rage including a gallery mode and a tutorial mode. They are:Legend ModeIn Legend Mode, the player fights through storylines based on events from the first story arc of the manga. At first, only Kenshiro is available, but as the player progresses, more characters become unlocked for play.Bosses in Legend Mode have their own unique stages set for them. The camera also changes so that it looks at where the boss is located. Boss character's are different with normal enemies as their gauge is a the bottom of the screen and are segmented into sections, depending on the boss, once a section is depleted, the boss would automatically push the character back and would either go into their aura, call out enemies or in some cases, both.Harbinger of Death: Now try doing this another 7 more times!Once the boss's health is completely drained, a finisher can be performed. This consists of pressing a combination of button prompts on the screen on a time limit. Once succeeded, the Signature move is performed and the boss is defeated. There is also an extended version of the button prompts if the Harbinger of Death is activated which consists of pressing 8 buttons in a row but must be done 8 times.ChaptersKenshiroChapter 1 - A Cry from the HeartChapter 2 - A Fated ReunionChapter 3 - The Stench of DeathChapter 4 - Blood FeudChapter 5 - The Star that Beckons ChaosChapter 6 - Into the DarknessChapter 7 - Reunited in BloodChapter 8 - Final SacrificeChapter 9 - Rampage of the NantoChapter 10 - The Nanto EmperorChapter 11 - The Empire CrumblesChapter 12 - Tears of the WolfChapter 13 - A Guiding LightChapter 14 - Farewell, BrotherTokiChapter 1 - A Giant AwakensChapter 2 - The Path of DestinyChapter 3 - The Sacred VowRaohChapter 1 - The Lost Hokuto BrotherChapter 2 - The Neverending StruggleChapter 3 - The Rise of HokutoChapter 4 - A Promise UnkeptChapter 5 - The Last Stand of NantoChapter 6 - Farewell, BrotherReiChapter 1 - The Nanto WandererChapter 2 - Bite of the FangChapter 3 - Genius UnmaskedChapter 4 - A Legend Born AnewChapter 5 - Staring Down the BeastChapter 6 - In Search of JusticeChapter 7 - Into the Flames of HellMamiyaChapter 1 - The Fang OffensiveChapter 2 - Lost to MadnessChapter 3 - Through the Gates of HellChapter 4 - A Death FortoldChapter 5 - Juda's Last GleamingDream ModeAn original storyline set in the Fist of the North Star universe.
