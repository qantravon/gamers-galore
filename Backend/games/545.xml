The game was created by Turbine and originally released by Microsoft. Turbine bought the full rights from Microsoft in 2003, moving the game completely in house during 2004 and is still producing monthly content updates for the game as of Septemeber 2012.FeaturesCharacter CreationThe game boasted a very deep system for character creation eschewing the selection of classes in favor of allocating a limited amount of points to primary stats and selecting training and specialization in a wide range of skills. This creation method allowed the player to create a highly customized character with the benefits and drawbacks that freedom provided. It was possible and probable to create characters wholly uncapable of surviving in the world.Monthly UpdatesAsheron's Call was also known for its monthly game updates. Initially, instead of expansion packs, the developers at Turbine chose to create monthly patches for the game that would introduce new and altered content for players. For instance, one of the first patches to the game, corresponding with the Christmas season, introduced snow covered terrain and a host of seasonal items such as snowballs and holiday themed quests and enemies.Seamless OverworldAsheron's Call implemented a seamless overworld with no loading between "zones." A character was capable of running from one side of Dereth (The name for the game's world) to the other without encountering a loading screen. The game world was also extremely large and could easily take a player over an hour to cross on foot. This decision to create the world without the use of zones allowed the terrain to be much more open and expansive, without funneling a player through bottlenecks to trigger loading between areas.PresentThe game still has several PVE servers as well as one very unique PVP server. Upon entering the PVP server of Darktide, all characters are flagged for PVP play upon creation. In PVP play you are able to kill other players and loot their corpses of any items that they may drop upon death.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10796">EverQuest</game><game id="12376">The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar</game><game id="12149">Dark Age of Camelot</game><game id="11142">Final Fantasy XI Online</game><game id="22063">Perfect World</game><game id="22997">The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria</game><game id="23356">EverQuest II: The Shadow Odyssey</game><game id="21426">The Chronicles of Spellborn</game><game id="24205">Star Wars: The Old Republic</game><game id="13869">Istaria: Chronicles of the Gifted</game><game id="20666">Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning</game><game id="21308">Aion: Ascension</game><game id="9705">Lineage II: The Chaotic Chronicle</game><game id="21749">Lineage III</game><game id="16013">Lineage: The Blood Pledge</game><game id="9641">Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</game><game id="20701">World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</game><game id="18603">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</game><game id="17494">Guild Wars</game><game id="8474">Guild Wars: Factions</game><game id="11082">Guild Wars: Nightfall</game><game id="18110">Guild Wars: Eye of the North</game><game id="21223">Guild Wars 2</game><game id="19796">City of Heroes</game><game id="7316">City of Villains</game><game id="21508">Champions Online</game><game id="5767">Ultima Online</game><game id="13479">Anarchy Online</game><game id="9124">The Matrix Online</game><game id="26641">Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss</game><game id="11770">Ultima Online: Mondain's Legacy</game><game id="22431">Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn</game><game id="13748">Ultima Online: Samurai Empire</game><game id="12425">Ultima Online: Age of Shadows</game><game id="16835">Ultima Online: The Second Age</game><game id="24336">Fiesta</game><game id="19138">Meridian 59</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/39473/1043114-250px_asheron_s_call_coverart.jpg</image></root>
