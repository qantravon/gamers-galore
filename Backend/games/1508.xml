There aren't many modes in the game, just a little career mode that isn't that deep which has you go through a list of courses and you check them off the list after you are done. The other is single race where you and/or a friend go head to head or against AI opponents and just go through a normal race. It is similar to the Twisted Metal series as it's also a vehicular based shooter racer.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10173">Twisted Metal 4</game><game id="14843">Spy Hunter</game><game id="9461">Critical Depth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14155/1759027-dead_in_the.jpg</image></root>
