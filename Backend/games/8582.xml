The "holo" (holographic) TV station KGS (Killing Game Show) broadcasts a single program, which pits surgically modified "criminals" against HALFs (Hostile Artificial Life Forms). Carl has been caught by 21st Century Government Inc. and forced into the gameshow, where he must fight through 16 "Pits of Death" across 8 moons.GameplayA joystick controls Carl, who must destroy enemies, pick up weapons and items (by briefly crouching), and escape each Pit of Death.  Each pit includes DOLL (Deadly to Organic Life Liquid) which slowly raises as gameplay progresses. DOLL can be avoided with a wall attachment feature. Failure to escape before the DOLL catches Carl results in an instant replay, so that the player may improve. </description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16194">Smash TV</game><game id="8191">Duke Nukem</game><game id="7227">Abuse</game><game id="15092">Turrican</game><game id="5744">Hard 'n Heavy</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370557-genesis_fatalrewind.jpg</image></root>
