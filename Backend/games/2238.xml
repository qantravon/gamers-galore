<root><id>2238</id><name>Rally-X</name><description>In Rally-X, you run a car about on a course with other cars chasing you and try to collect ten flags before running out of fuel or crashing.Â As your fuel runs down they get a bit faster than you, although you have ways to escape them. Each way is costly, though. You can kick smoke out of your tailpipe which will stun cars for a bit, but that loses fuel. Ducking around too much and ignoring flags also costs time. The mazes get progressively tougher.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21465">Retro Game Challenge</game><game id="5101">Radar Rat Race</game><game id="16629">New Rally-X</game><game id="39877">Paris-Dakar Rally Special!</game><game id="40377">Yuu Maze</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1078862-rallyxflyer.jpg</image></root>
