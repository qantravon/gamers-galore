The remake was the first step in a plan to introduce the Sakura Taisen franchise to an internal audience called the "Sakura Taisen World Project." The idea behind the project was to release Atsuki Chishio Ni outside of Japan and if it was successful then the rest of the series would be localized for the PlayStation 2. Nothing ever came of the World Project and the series remained in Japan until NIS America released So Long My Love in 2010.
