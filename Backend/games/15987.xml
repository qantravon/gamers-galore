It was the first Madden game to include online play, exclusively on the PS2. Al Michaels replaced Pat Summerall as the in-game commentator. Gamers could also customize player formations, receiver routes and entire playbooks for the first time.  The game had a less serious approach then some of the later games, including humorous fictional teams with full stats.
