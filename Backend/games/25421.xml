<root><id>25421</id><name>Rock Band Unplugged</name><description>OverviewRock Band Unplugged is a PSP game developed by both Harmonix Music Systems and Backbone Entertainment, based on Harmonix's acclaimed Rock Band franchise. The game ditches the series' usual method of control with musical instrument peripherals and instead adopts a control style very similar to Amplitude and Frequency, two previous games by Harmonix. The game controls with 4 separate tracks - one for each instrument - and the user switches between them after completing parts of the song. The player hits notes with the four face buttons and tries to time the presses to the music as well as a coloured block coming down the screen, or note highway as it is officially called.SetlistThere are 41 songs in Rock Band Unplugged, all of them master tracks.
