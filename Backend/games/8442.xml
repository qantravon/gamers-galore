Gameplay and GraphicsGameplay in ONE ONE is a typical third person shooter for the time. The camera is pulled back behind the character who can attack enemies using either his arm-gun or combos of punches and kicks. The game has 6 levels, each with a boss fight at the end. The bosses were not susceptible to gunfire and had to be defeated by making clever use of the environment.  The graphics for ONE were extremely good for the time. It has some of the best looking explosions and animation on the PlayStation. ReceptionThe game was poorly received by most critics. The major complaints for the game were that it was initially too difficult and didn't introduce gameplay properly, forcing the player to simply die over and over until they got it right. Critics also mention the game's poor controls and spacing of save points as negative factors.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7454">C: The Contra Adventure</game><game id="7382">Loaded</game><game id="2893">Re-Loaded</game><game id="6823">Apocalypse</game><game id="13336">Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain</game><game id="8098">Neo Contra</game><game id="20470">Bionic Commando</game><game id="4209">Prototype</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2276926-box_one.png</image></root>
