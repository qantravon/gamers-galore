Developer Deep Shadows' innovative game engine streams the beautifully rendered environment, creating a non-linear gameplay experience, with no loading times or separate levels, creating a continuous world spanning hundreds of miles. To make the most of the environment, a massive range of vehicles are at the disposal of the player, as well as a vast array of weapons. The wide open game world features an array of different AI factions with which the player can interact, and hundreds of diverse missions to create an original experience each time the game is played.
