Each wizard starts with a set number of spell points that can be spent on various magic, and damage dealt to enemy wizards or their creatures will replenish spell points the next turn. There are three types of spell; Summoning creatures, projectile attacks and self-buffs such as increased strength or speed.  According to the game's creator, Anthony Hamilton, Morkin 1 was a game that he developed for the      Atari ST in 1991 but that was later lost. Soon thereafter, the Spectrum ZX game       Chaos: The Battle of Wizards inspired him to create Morkin 2 in a similar style.  According to the    official website, a sequel is in the works.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9342">Chaos: The Battle of Wizards</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/78217/1619972-morkin2_000.png</image></root>
