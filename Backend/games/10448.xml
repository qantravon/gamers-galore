<root><id>10448</id><name>Spy Hunter</name><description> OverviewSpy Hunter is a vehicle-based vertical scrolling shooter. The player can control the speed of the scrolling by accelerating or decelerating their car. The stages are a series of seamlessly connected highways full of traffic, enemy cars, and road hazards for the player to either shoot or avoid. Occasionally a red truck will appear and if the player can drive into it, they get a new gadget to use on enemies. The game uses the Peter Gunn theme as its soundtrack, and has twitchy controls and a pointedly brutal level of difficulty. Enemy spawns are random, and many enemies can kill the player instantly through weapons or collisions. During the first part of the game, a timer ticks down in the corner of the screen, and while its going the player gets unlimited lives. After the timer completes, the game moves to a traditional life-based system.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11058">Action Fighter</game><game id="5930">Mach Rider</game><game id="5075">Bump 'N' Jump</game><game id="20108">Astro Fang: Super Machine</game><game id="23527">Hardware 2</game><game id="19714">Fire and Forget</game><game id="20704">Speed Rumbler</game><game id="11832">Road Fighter</game><game id="8500">Stainless Steel</game><game id="13567">Grand Theft Auto</game><game id="2967">Crazy Car</game><game id="35953">Battle Grand Prix</game><game id="21960">Miami Vice</game><game id="37619">Crazy Rally</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362254-nes_spyhunter.jpg</image></root>
