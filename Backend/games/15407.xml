<root><id>15407</id><name>Libero Grande</name><description>Released in 1998 for the    PlayStation.Â  A typical arcade   soccer game in its  nature, Libero Grande introduced a novelty factor: the ability to  play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team, always  swapping for players nearer the ball. The player starts to choose one of the star players, and then a national  team. Each star player, based on a real football player but with  changed names (   Zinedine Zidane is Zenon Zadkine, for  instance) is rated in both ball skill, speed and shooting abilities. In addition to the original arcade mode, the home release adds an  International mode (basically, the FIFA World Cup    format), a league  competition (up to eight star players/teams), which can be all human  controlled and a skills mode where the player has to complete several  training ground tasks such as hitting a target floating in the goal  mouth or hitting an area from distance.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37246">Zenkoku Koukou Soccer Senshuken 96</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/329/1294845-1.jpg</image></root>
