The title of the game is possibly an homage to the classic game Hack.Dungeon Hack's biggest plus and difference from other dungeon crawler games of the same era is the ability to generate random dungeons (or enter a seed by hand, so players can compare their success with each other). The game engine ( Eye of Beholder III engine) follows the basic formula of the Dungeon Hack / First person games, but instead of a four-head party, the player takes control of one brave hero that takes on the minions from the deep. The character generation offers the standard array of DD classes and races. The random dungeons offer ever-new layouts, puzzles and creature distribution. Although the generated dungeons never feel critically different, the replay value of the game, despite lacking an engaging story, is very high.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1200">Abandoned Places: A Time for Heroes</game><game id="17285">Anvil of Dawn</game><game id="1388">Bloodwych</game><game id="18518">Dungeon Master</game><game id="15771">Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep</game><game id="140">NetHack</game><game id="18358">Hack</game><game id="20262">Angband</game><game id="22309">Rogue</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/608904-564794_45794_front_1_.jpg</image></root>
