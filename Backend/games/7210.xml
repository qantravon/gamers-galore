<root><id>7210</id><name>Legend: Hand of God</name><description>Legend is a standard RPG. You start out with little equiment, take some quests, kill enemies, take the loot, level-up, spend your points to increase your abilities and repeat. The story is about the fire (of light) that for some reason is extinguished, releasing the hordes of hell. You need to retrieve an ancient artifact to rid the world of evil. Graphics are good though nothing special. Voice acting is not really up to standards. Gameplay is diablo style hack 'n slash. Fully mouse driven.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1119">Diablo II</game><game id="1727">Dungeon Siege II</game><game id="8638">Titan Quest</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/628/354959-hand_of_god.jpg</image></root>
