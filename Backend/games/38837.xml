The game is very much like the games in the Descent series as it uses tight spaces and a six-axis rotation and move style.The game comes with a single-player campaign and lots of multi-player options including co-op and hot-seat.At this moment (November 2012) the game is still in beta with a scheduled release early 2013.KickstarterThe game did an unsuccessful kickstarter campaign in the spring of 2012 collecting only a small part of the funding they needed to upgrade and enhance the game. After finishing the kickstarter campaign they were contacted by a manager of games retailer Gamestop who were interested in financing some of the game asking only some exclusivity. Thanks to this initiative the game could be completed.</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17071">Descent</game><game id="27454">Miner Wars 2081</game><game id="15636">Forsaken</game><game id="2903">Descent 3</game><game id="5507">Descent II</game><game id="15187">Descent Maximum</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/2369385-retrovirus_box.png</image></root>
