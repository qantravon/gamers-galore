<root><id>35774</id><name>Bug Hunt</name><description>A one or two player (pass  play) game, Bug Hunt presents the player with a 4x2 grid representing a circuit board. As "bugs", literally insects, begin to infest the board the player must shoot the bugs using the XG-1 light gun to complete the wave. The game tracks hits, bullets fired and overall accuracy. Points are scored based on the different enemy types, with large static spiders offering fewer points than small mobile ticks. The games ends if the player fails to maintain the minimum accuracy rating for the wave, usually around 40%, or when the player completes all seven waves. Upon completion or failure the player is graded and given a rank ranging from CEO (for poor performance) to Engineer.</description><genres><genre id="35">Light-Gun Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4174">Alien Brigade</game><game id="19616">Barnyard Blaster</game><game id="14841">Crossbow</game><game id="33790">Crime Buster</game><game id="2533">Meltdown</game><game id="16328">Sentinel</game><game id="9438">Shooting Gallery</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117041/1823499-bhtitle.jpg</image></root>
