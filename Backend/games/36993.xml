<root><id>36993</id><name>Project CARS</name><description>Project CARS is currently in development and is targeted for a Q2 2014 release on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. Since it is still in early alpha, many content deals are yet to be done, so there are placeholder names for many tracks and cars. Some are fictional, such as the Shifter Kart 01 and Formula B.Project CARS is the first game to use Slightly Mad Studio's (SMS) new crowd sourced funding project named WMD portal (World of Mass Development). Interested customers can purchase one of 6 different levels of membership at this point in development ranging from "junior member" for 10 € all the way up to "Senior Manager" for 25000 €. The amount of access gamers have to the games development depends on what membership they purchased, so junior members get monthly builds and can post in the forums but can't create new threads. The next level up, Team Member, can play weekly builds of the game and start threads in the forums. The top level of membership allows members to attend development meetings, play every build of the game and gain a dedicated sub forum. Funding has reached it's target of 3,750,000 €, and therefore has been closed.The following features are planned to be in the final release of the game:FeaturesCareer StructureCloud-Based Social NetworkComplete Day/Night Time CycleCo-op CareerDedicated Server and MatchmakingDriving SchoolDynamic WeatherFree Practice and Time Trial ModesFull Race Weekend Format (practice, qualify, warmup, race)Ghost RacingHelmet Camera with head lean and look to apexLiving Tracks, which include track rubbering, drying of wet racing lines, and buildup of marblesPit2Car Radio CommunicationPit StopsPortable/Mobile AppsReflective Windshield with Progressive DirtSafety CarTelemetry AcquisitionTire Deformation, including flat spots and puncturesTrackIR SupportWeb LeaderboardsWind and Ambient/Track Temperature, which will affect drivingThe following cars and tracks appear in build 346:CarsAerial Atom 3 - 2011Aerial Atom 500 V8 - 2011Aerial Atom Mugen - 2011Asano LM11 TDX (Audi R18) - 2011Asano X4 Touring (Audi DTM) - 2011BAC Mono - 2011BMW M1 Procar - 1981BMW Z4 GT3 - 2012Caper Stock Car - 1990Caterham ClassicCaterham SP300.RCaterham Superlight R500Ford Capri (Group 5 - Team Zakspeed) - 1980Formula A (Generic Formula 1) - 2011Formula B - 2011Formula Rookie (Formula Ford) - 2012Gumpert Apollo Sport - 2011Lotus 49  49C - 1967Lotus 78 - 1977Lotus 98T - 1986Pagani HuayraPagani Zonda RPalmer Jaguar - 2011Racer L4-RS (Radical)Racer V8-RS (Radical)Shifter Kart 125ccShifter Kart 250cc "SuperKart"TracksRoad CoursesAnhalt (Oschersleben)Azure Circuit (Monaco)Azure Coast (Country Road)Connecticut Hill (Watkins Glenn)Badenring (Hockenheim)Bathurst (Mount Panorama)Belgian Forest Circuit (Spa Francorchamps)Besos (Catalunya)Bologna (Imola)California Highway (Country Road)California Raceway (Willow Springs Raceway)Derby (Donington Park)Eifelwald (Nürburgring Nordschleife  GP)Florence (Mugello)Heusden (Circuit Zolder)Jin Ding (Zhuhai)Lakeville Raceway GP (Infineon/Sonoma Raceway)Loire 24 (Circuit de la Sarthe)Loire National (Bugatti Circuit)Milan (Monza)Monterey (Laguna Seca)Moravia (Brno Circuit)Northampton (Silverstone)Sakitto (Suzuka)Test TrackWisconsin Raceway (Road America)OvalsDelaware (Dover)Harrison Pike Raceway (Inspired by Indianapolis with Fictional Infield)Henrico (Richmond)Memphis (Bristol)Volusia (Daytona)Kart CoursesChesterfieldGlencairnSummertonUpcoming Cars and TracksAnnounced upcoming content includes:CarsBMW 1M Coupe - 2012BMW 320 Turbo Group 5 - 1978BMW 328 Touring Coupe - 1940BMW BTCC 3-Series - 2012BMW F1.08 - 2008BMW M3 E92 GT - 2012BMW M3 Group A Touring Car - 1991BMW V12 LMR - 1999Ford Escort RS1600 - 1972Ford Falcon SG (Australian V8 Supercar of the Future) - 2013Ford Focus ST - 2012Ford Focus ST (BTCC) - 2012Ford Fusion NASCAR Stock Car - 2012Ford MK I (1967)Ford Mustang Cobra (SCCA Trans-Am) - 1997Ford Shelby GT500 - 2013Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth Group A - 1988Formula Gulf 1000 - 2012Ginetta G40 JuniorGinetta G50Ginetta G55 GT3Lotus 25 - 1962Lotus 38 - 1965Lotus 40 - 1965Lotus 51 - 1967Lotus 56 - 1968Lotus 72 - 1970Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI Tommi Mäkinen EditionMitsubishi Lancer Evo IX FQ 360Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X FQ 400Pagani Zonda CinqueRUF CTR "Yellowbird" - 1987RUF CTR 3 - 2012RUF RGT-8 - 2012RUF Rt 12R - 2012TracksBrands HatchCadwell ParkHistoric Belgian Forest Circuit (Historic Spa Francorchamps)Milan Oval (Monza Oval)Oulton ParkSnettertonSolitude Rennstreck</description><genres><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20130">rFactor</game><game id="27298">rFactor 2</game><game id="19522">Live for Speed</game><game id="21472">iRacing.com</game><game id="33400">Forza Motorsport 4</game><game id="21790">Gran Turismo 5</game><game id="14858">GTR 2: FIA GT Racing Game</game><game id="23526">GTR: Evolution</game><game id="327">Race 07: The Official WTCC Game</game><game id="34542">F1 2011</game><game id="25985">F1 2010</game><game id="30383">DiRT 3</game><game id="24513">DiRT 2</game><game id="3916">DiRT</game><game id="15931">Richard Burns Rally</game><game id="37181">Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends</game><game id="25225">Need for Speed: SHIFT</game><game id="32253">SHIFT 2: Unleashed</game><game id="37743">F1 2012</game><game id="37034">Dirt Showdown</game><game id="43251">F1 2013</game><game id="43281">Assetto Corsa</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/31048/2075795-cars_logo.jpg</image></root>
