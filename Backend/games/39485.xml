<root><id>39485</id><name>The Border Lands</name><description>The Border Lands is an homage to the great top down shooters of old, in particular Smash TV. One of four characters from Borderlands 2, each with their own separate attributes, can be selected to fight through waves of baddies who enter from all sides of the arena. In the process, the stock pistol that's given to the character can be upgraded through chests that appear when certain enemies are killed, allowing the character to pick between their current weapon or one of two other weapons, each with varying effects, rates of fire, clip size, and damage. The player's character levels up as well, gaining more health and better speed with every level increased. The main objective of the game is to fight through multiple waves of enemies, and amass enough cash to earn a high score on the leaderboard before their lives run out.The game is playable at http://wubwub.eu/</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6850">Commando</game><game id="16194">Smash TV</game><game id="1619">Ikari Warriors</game><game id="11233">Robotron: 2084</game><game id="2786">Llamatron: 2112</game><game id="27873">I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MBIES!!!1</game><game id="32017">Realm of the Mad God</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2299599-screen_shot_2012_08_23_at_9.37.46_am.png</image></root>
