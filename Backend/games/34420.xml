<root><id>34420</id><name>Xbox Live Labs</name><description> You too can be a scientist for Xbox Live Labs!This application collects data for a total of 6 hours, giving 0 point Achievements and avatar rewards at three separate intervals: one after allowing the application to run for a continuous 30 minutes, one after your time running the app adds up to one hour, and the last after your time running the app runs for six hours. After the 30 minute test, your time running the app is recorded every time you run the app, meaning you don't have to run the app for six consecutive hours. The Xbox is unable to be used for anything else while the data is being collected; however, it may be interrupted and resumed at any time.  In the United States, the application was only available until March 27, 2011.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2164/1729611-xbox_live_labs.png</image></root>
