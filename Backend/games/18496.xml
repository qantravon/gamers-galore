The player is thrust into the role of a contestant on a game show in which the goal is to battle gangs in an armored, weapon equipped vehicle in dysotopian enivronments.Darkly humorous FMV scenes featuring the show's host, Lance Boyle, helped create the atmosphere of a slightly inhumane, high-stakes game show, but the actual gameplay was not much more than a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone, albeit a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone with pretty pre-rendered graphics. Many Packard Bell multi-media computers of the time came with the game pre-installed to show off the power of the CD-ROM medium, which had just come into vogue with the release of Myst in 1993.The game was ported to the 3DO and Sega CD a few months after its release on PC.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="38">Vehicular Combat</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9707">WipEout</game><game id="13281">Chase H.Q.</game><game id="11492">Chase H.Q.
