<root><id>42508</id><name>IronSoul</name><description>Iron Soul is the unpredictable fusion of 3rd person shooting and fast platforming in a story driven, 3D action game. To make it happen, the team drew inspiration from various school 3rd person titles we all know and love (Name dropping MDK!). Such elements are reinvigorated within a industrial setting full of mad robots, unknown voices and mysterious compounds. It has been a long, two year journey for both the development team, project and its protagonist, H-25 but we are finally there. Now we must stand united to withstand the upcoming force known as bot-mageddon!
