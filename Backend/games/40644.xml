It did not receive a US release, though its sequel World Soccer did. The US release of World Soccer is what US players know as the game Great Soccer. The game was one of the few to be released on the Sega Mark III's early card format, before the system moved to cartridges.The game is played with a vertical field perspective, where the goals are situated at the top and bottom of a vertically-scrolling screen. This is entirely different to World Soccer (World)/Great Soccer (US), in which the field is horizontal.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2375569-great_soccer_c_sms_eu.jpg</image></root>
