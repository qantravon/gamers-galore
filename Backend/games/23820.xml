This game is free to download at a third party website www.doujinstyle.com Ether Vapor Remaster, the follow up to this game, is also available at the same link and is also free, which is strange considering that this game costs several Brad Bucks to download on Steam. Interesting what a little bit of sleuthing can do for you, isn't it?</description><genres><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14982/915195-screenshot0125.jpg</image></root>
