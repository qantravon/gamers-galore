This port was the first game in the franchise to appear on a console. It took a majority of the levels from the original  Painkiller as well as a few from the  Battle out of Hell expansion pack, and remixed them for the limited Xbox memory (meaning some levels were cut while others had more loading screens and less areas). This stripped-down version still retained all the weapons of the original game, but it only received one of the two new weapons from the expansion pack. The multiplayer however was intact and ready for use on  Xbox Live. Unfortunately, because the game at its best was still slightly more powerful than the Xbox could reliably handle,  Hell Wars was considered inferior to the PC version of the game. It received mediocre reviews and sold poorly.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5036">Serious Sam II</game><game id="65">Serious Sam</game><game id="97">Serious Sam: Next Encounter</game><game id="8015">Quake</game><game id="3207">Quake II</game><game id="27152">Serious Sam: The First Encounter</game><game id="7326">Doom</game><game id="621">Doom II: Hell on Earth</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1803974-box_pkillerhw.png</image></root>
