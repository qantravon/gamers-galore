I have a Lite Sabor! Hitting the shield enough times would make a hole and leave the opponent vulnerable.  A hit scored in this manner awarded the attacker a point.  Occasionally the remote would go crazy and fire lightning in an erratic manner. The game used the paddle controls.There was also a  PLug'N'Play version released before the 2600 port.    </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22407">Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</game><game id="19303">Swordfight</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2367835-a2600_starwarsjediarena_none.jpg</image></root>
