The gameplay is similar to other entries in the series, but adds a new size mechanic. When Bonk collects different colored candies, he will either grow or shrink. Candy allows Bonk to access areas he would otherwise be too big, or too small to get to. The game features a cooperative 2 player mode. Bonk 3 was released in 2 formats: HuCard and CD.The American release of the game is somewhat difficult to find. It was released very late in the life of the TurboGrafx-16.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2090566-box_bonk3.png</image></root>
