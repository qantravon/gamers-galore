Each defeated enemy also takes off a small amount of Silviana's health. In order to stay alive, Silviana must occasionally visit towns and replenish her health by drinking tea as well as upgrade her equipment to ensure survival against tougher enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14318">Ys: The Vanished Omens</game><game id="2363">Hydlide</game><game id="11949">The Legend of Zelda</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2349347-silviana___ai_ippai_no_boukensya__japan_.jpg</image></root>
