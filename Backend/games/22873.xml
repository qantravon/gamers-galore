The original Pong was released in 1972, and is the first video game to achieve wide-spread popularity in both the arcade and at-home markets.This version of the game is among the first of its kind to take the typical top-down 2-D approach to Pong, and tosses in a third dimension to the tennis-type action. The game was released on the iTunes App store on August 2, 2008.GameplayVector Pong stays true to the original pong game. The goal is to hit a ball from your paddle to the opponents, while hopefully getting it past them to score a point. The players paddle is right in front of him, and the opponents can be seen on the opposite end of the court. The 3-D aspect comes from the fact that you are now viewing the playing field from behind your translucent pong paddle.You start the game by tapping your pong paddle to launch the ball at your opponent. The ball gets faster every time it hits either your or your opponent's paddle. The ball can bounce off any of the walls, floor, or ceiling of the playing field, which can make catching it difficult. The scoring is standard Tennis scoring, with the score going from 15, to 30, to 40, then game point. In the event of a tie, the winner has to win by 2.Updates1.3 - released 8/2/08- Network play is now more stable1.2 - release date unknown- Calibration helper allows viewing from different angles- AI is more balanced- Additional sounds added</description><genres><genre id="25">Tennis</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22195">Pong</game><game id="977">Pong: The Next Level</game><game id="7346">Ponx</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15284/466445-picture_1.png</image></root>
