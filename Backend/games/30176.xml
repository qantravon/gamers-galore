<root><id>30176</id><name>Zenonia 2: The Lost Memories</name><description>Zenonia 2 starts years after the original game left off, with the evil that was once trapped being freed again to cause trouble. With 4 new playable characters, the game offers several new features over the original (iPhone version):  - Customizable button placement - Full touch screen support- An asynchronous PvP system- Completely revamped menu/level/inventory system - More levels of difficulty  "The Lost Memories" maintains many of the original game's key concepts, such as much required grinding, extremely difficult dungeons, and weapons that wear out over time. While this was a critique of the original game from newer RPG players, the majority of people who played the game enjoy the classic "JRPG" experience offered from the original, and now the sequel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30016">Across Age</game><game id="28868">Dungeon Hunter</game><game id="30422">Chaos Rings</game><game id="29634">Legends of Exidia</game><game id="34164">Queen's Crown</game><game id="24354">Magician’s Quest: Mysterious Times</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5370/1288788-zenonia_2_logo.jpg</image></root>
