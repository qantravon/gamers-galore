For example, you need to feed your gnomes by utilizing agriculture, give them drinks through a well or a brewery, fend off creatures and build a prosperous kingdom for them! There's also crafting, trap-making, mining for precious ores underground among other things.The gnomes have different professions, depending on what you need them to do. This can be changed at any time during the game, but when you do the gnomes take a quick nap and cancels their current task. By building bedrooms for them, the need for naps is reduced and work becomes more efficient.List of job skillsMinerMasonStonecarverWoodcutterCarpenterWoodcarverSmelterBlacksmithMetalworkerWeaponsmithArmorerGemcutterJewelerWeaverTailorPotterLeatherworkerTinkererMachinistEngineerMechanicRancherButcheryGardenerFarmerChefMedicCaretakerBrewerBuilderHaulerThe player may also may also make custom "professions" by making a list one or many of the above skills and assigning a priority to them.
