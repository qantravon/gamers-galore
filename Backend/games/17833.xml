It did not receive an Arcade release prior to its home console port; rather, it was created specifically for the Sega Master System. It later saw ports to the MSX and NES the following year.In 2008, a version of Fantasy Zone II was included with the Sega Ages Fantasy Zone compilation, which was an attempt to recreate the game had it been developed for Sega's System 16 arcade boards, which were in-use at the time of its SMS release. Another version would also make its way to the Wii Shop's Virtual Console in 2009, available in all regions.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362890-sms_fantasyzone2_br.jpg</image></root>
