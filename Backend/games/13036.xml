It is a multi-screen game that puts the player's ship through five different waves, including a boss fight of sorts against a shielded mothership. One of the five screens is a take on the Namco game, Galaxian. Midway distributed the arcade version of Galaxian in the United States, but the home version rights did not carry over. As a result, home versions of Gorf had the Galaxian screen excised.Gorf was one of the first arcade machines to feature synthesized speech via a Votrax chip. It also employed the use of lights on the bezel, which would light up behind the player's current rank. With each completion of the game's five screens, the player's rank increases. The in-game voice also refers to players by their current rank, be it "Space Cadet" or "Space Captain" and so on.The game's creator, Jamie Fenton, went on to work on a follow-up called Ms. Gorf, but it was never released.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5099">Space Invaders</game><game id="2445">Galaxian</game><game id="16120">Space Armada</game><game id="9694">Megamania</game><game id="12834">Alien Invaders - Plus!</game><game id="14030">Demons to Diamonds</game><game id="15941">Demon Attack</game><game id="23504">Vector Vaders</game><game id="12744">Chicken Invaders</game><game id="8125">Astrosmash</game><game id="13424">Cheesy Invaders</game><game id="1293">CHAMP Invaders</game><game id="23221">Phoenix</game><game id="18684">Wizard of Wor</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2248846-gorf.png</image></root>
