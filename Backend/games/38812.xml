<root><id>38812</id><name>Toki no Tabibito</name><description>OverviewToki no Tabibito "Time Stranger" is an adventure game with a heavy emphasis on text commands and dialogue, similar to other NES adventure games like Portopia Serial Murder Case or Hokkaido Serial Murders: Fade to Okhotsk.GameplayUnlike Portopia and its sequels, there is very little detective work to be done. The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves.While there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="36">Text Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="7067">Mario's Time Machine</game><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2247588-250px_toki_no_tabibito_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
