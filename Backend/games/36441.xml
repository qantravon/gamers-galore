He longed for a body so he decided to infiltrate a planet and take over the minds of the inhabitants. The planets are now filled with Scab Plants, Brain Orbs and Orb Essence to help the orb keep control over the world.You, the player, are a creature equiped with the symbiotic gun called Macroterra. You are designed to take out the Orb and restore the planets.GameplayXotic's gameplay focus is on high scores. Score is earned by killing enemies, destroying Scab Plants and Brain Orbs, and collecting Orb Essences, as well as completing levels (generally done by defeating all enemies and reaching the exit) in a timely fashion. Power-ups can be found throughout the levels that grant temporary abilities or bonuses, such as flight or score multipliers. Experience is earned from completing levels, and can be spent to purchase health and armor upgrades, and also secondary weapons with effects such as stunning or burning enemies.PC System RequirementsOS: Windows XP, Vista, 7Processor: 1.7 GHz Dual Core or betterMemory: 2 GBHard Disk Space: 3.5 GBVideo Card: 512 MB DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card (shader model 3)DirectXÂ®: 9.0cSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible</description><genres><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="22011">Zeno Clash</game><game id="18777">The Club</game><game id="17578">Rez</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2074744-box_xotic.png</image></root>
