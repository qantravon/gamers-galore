<root><id>2021</id><name>Time Gal</name><description>OverviewInspired by FMV laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair and Ninja Hayate, Time Gal is a similarly structured arcade action-adventure filled with fully animated cutscenes and sequences. Players must lead Reika Kirishima through sixteen unique time periods and stop the evil Luda in his task to change history and gain power in his own time. As in Dragon's Lair, the player must think and react quickly to on-screen prompts in order to successfully guide Reika through each time period and face dangers such as dinosaurs in 70,000,000 BC and killer robots in the year 4000 AD.Time Gal features animation produced by Japanese studio Toei Animation, the studio responsible for numerous popular anime series and movies including the Dragon Ball franchise. The art and animation style is typical for mid to late 80's Japanese animation. The game was later ported to the Sega CD and saw a Western release in April of 1993. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="463">Space Ace</game><game id="23">Dragon's Lair</game><game id="15630">The Masked Rider: Kamen Rider ZO</game><game id="13227">Road Avenger</game><game id="2389">Revenge of the Ninja</game><game id="32217">Dragon's Lair Trilogy</game><game id="41330">Triad Stone</game><game id="43105">Albegas</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/139866/2430286-28131401.jpg</image></root>
