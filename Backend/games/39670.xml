This is required to destroy a massive mechanical battle planet that is aiming to crash the Earth's moon into the Earth, the impact of which is determined to happen at the end of a 100 day timer in the corner that ticks ever downwards. Much of the game's action is directed by menus, such as choosing planets and moons to visit and landing on them to locate parts. There are a few action sequences as well.The game was never released outside of Japan.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="730">Star Raiders</game><game id="33201">WarpSpeed</game><game id="867">Star Voyager</game><game id="29935">Mass Effect 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2418582-uchuusen_cosmo_carrier.jpg</image></root>
