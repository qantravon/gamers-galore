Each cell of the puzzle can, to some degree, be explored. The player must rearrange the tiles around the board to line up the images correctly. In some cases,  tiles can be overlapped to give the character access to new areas. A playable demo was released in 2012  from the Gorogoa website.The game is scheduled for release at the end of 2013.  </description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/4/48985/2413022-2411747_screen_shot_2013_01_11_at_4.30.46_pm.png</image></root>
