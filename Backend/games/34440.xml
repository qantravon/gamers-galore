The goal of the game is to guide your ball, which is constantly in motion, to the end of the pipe maze. This is done by shifting tiles into the proper position.If pipes are not placed into the proper configuration, the ball runs out of track and crashes to the bottom of the screen. At this point, the player must start again.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20227">Loopz</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1731298-timeball.jpg</image></root>
