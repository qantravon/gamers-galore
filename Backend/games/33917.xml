It was released in arcades January 20, 2010. An Xbox 360 port was released in Japan February 3, 2011, in two different ways: as DLC for DoDonPachi Daifukkatsu 1.5, and as a standalone retail game. The standalone retail version includes a special crossover mode with the stages and enemies of Daifukkatsu, but the player ships and systems from  Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi. The DLC version was later released in PAL regions in November 2011.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17644">Espgaluda</game><game id="26366">Espgaluda II</game><game id="30001">Espgaluda II Black Label</game><game id="29280">Mushihime-sama Futari</game><game id="22393">Mushihime-Sama</game><game id="33885">Muchi Muchi Pork!</game><game id="32381">Pink Sweets ~Ibara Sorekara~</game><game id="34237">Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi</game><game id="34001">Crimzon Clover</game><game id="34268">Mushihime-sama Futari Black Label</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2291728-box_ddpdbl.png</image></root>
