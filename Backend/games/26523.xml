However the main reason this game gained any attention was for the animated film that serves as the games story. Once it was uploaded to youtube it became something of a meme due to the low quality of its voice acting, animation and overall presentation.</description><genres><genre id="40">Soccer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5434/1029770-cover_art.jpg</image></root>
