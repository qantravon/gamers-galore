This changed due to a lawsuit, as       Nintendo threatened to take legal action due to the game's deliberate similarity to their flagship franchise. Just like the     The Great Giana Sisters, Hard N Heavy features two heroes (Heavy and Metal) who make their way through a vertically-scrolling world.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13277">The Great Giana Sisters</game><game id="15092">Turrican</game><game id="8582">Fatal Rewind</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/688178-1039262458_00.gif</image></root>
