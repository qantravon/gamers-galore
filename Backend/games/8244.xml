The game mostly takes place from a fixed bird's eye perspective, though will occasionally switch to a first-person panoramic view whenever the player enters a town or a dungeon. In addition to these modes, combat plays out on a grid in a turn-based fashion.The game has a deep and complex storyline and features many pages of in-game lore to be discovered and enjoyed. After crash landing on a alien jungle planet while studying the surface for its suitability for terraforming, Tom Driscoll (a pilot and the game's protagonist) and Rainer Hofstedt (a physicist and xenobiologist) find themselves at awe at just how advanced the planet's wildlife is and wonder how they will be able to complete their mission and return to their mothership, the Toronto. Along the way they befriend and help an intelligent alien species called the Iskai. They also discover that the other intelligent race on the planet are humans like them, prompting a journey of discovery on how humanity reached a planet many light years away from home.The game features very detailed graphics and critically appraised soundtrack. Beside the Adventure element, the game's characters have skills, attributes and inventories as well.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12809">Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse</game><game id="10464">Amberstar</game><game id="18454">Ambermoon</game><game id="1156">Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator</game><game id="2674">Outcast</game><game id="2947">Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/632142-7056_boxshot_albion_1_.jpg</image></root>
