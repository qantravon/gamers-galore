The game was designed by   Benoît Sokal, who would later become known for the critically acclaimed  point and click adventure games   Syberia and   Syberia 2. Several references to Amerzone are found in these games, and the games take place in the same fictional universe.PlotThe game starts off with the player character (a journalist), meeting an old adventurer named Alexandre Valembois. The adventurer was originally a scientist, who travelled to Amerzone, when he was young, to find a mysterious white bird. These birds are born, live and die in the sky without ever landing. Alexandre betrayed the natives of Amerzone, by stealing a giant egg. Now Alexandre is much older, and he regrets the things he did when he was younger, and wants to fix his mistakes. That's were the main character comes in.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3970">Myst</game><game id="8902">Schizm: Mysterious Journey</game><game id="4118">Beyond Atlantis</game><game id="19402">Beyond Time</game><game id="16489">Sinking Island</game><game id="4403">Post Mortem</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2593/417219-835.jpg</image></root>
