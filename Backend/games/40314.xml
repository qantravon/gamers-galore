Inspired by a Youtube meme involving footage of Marble Hornets.Photo Album: Pictures of Slender Man.Extra Batteries: Players start with 100 battery cells, and each time the player is caught by Slender Man, 10 cells are used up. More cells can be purchased. A player is still able to play without cells, but the game's visibility becomes limited.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="39028">Slender: The Eight Pages</game><game id="40201">Slender-Man</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/164924/2355747-512.png</image></root>
