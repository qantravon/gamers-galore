<root><id>39821</id><name>Stick Hunter</name><description>OverviewStick Hunter is a curiously named ice hockey simulator, published by K Amusement Co., though developers-for-hire Micronics were responsible for the game. Though it holds the distinction of being the very first ice hockey game for the NES, it was never released outside of Japan.Before starting each game, players can designate a single- or two-player game, the skill level of the CPU opponents (on single-player), the amount of time the match will take and the teams playing. The eight teams are based on hockey-playing countries, which include the USA, Canada, Japan, USSR (now Russia and the former Soviet states), England (though this country's flag is the Union Jack, suggesting the United Kingdom instead) France, Norway and Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia).</description><genres><genre id="39">Hockey</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2329130-stick_hunter_fc_box.jpg</image></root>
