<root><id>33781</id><name>Bagman</name><description>Bagman is an arcade action game where the player, an escaped criminal, must grab bags of money out of a mine and place them in a wheelbarrow that sits above ground. The game allows free movement between three different, connected screens.  Dangers include mine carts that rush back and forth along some paths and guards that chase after the bagman. You can turn the tables on the guards by collecting a pick-axe and rushing them with it. You can also drop bags of money on them from ladders to temporarily stun the guards.  Bootleg versions of Bagman exist for the Commodore 64 under the names "Bagitman" and "Gilligan's Gold."</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8373">Bagitman</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1678864-bagmanarcflyer.jpg</image></root>
