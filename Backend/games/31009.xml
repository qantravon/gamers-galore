This version costs 800 MSP.   There are two modes for the game, Classic and Twist. Classic is the  standard match-three Bejeweled game. In Twist, you can rotate any gems  in groups of four squares (two by two), right or left without penalty.  Rounds are 60 seconds in this mode and you need to get as many matches  as possible. </description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="34988">Zuma Blitz</game><game id="7395">Pokémon Trozei!</game><game id="19154">Pokémon Pinball</game><game id="38477">Jewel Keepers: Easter Island</game><game id="39741">Diamond Twister</game><game id="37996">Solitaire Blitz</game><game id="44064">Zombie Zombie Zombie</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1676350-box_bjblitz.png</image></root>
