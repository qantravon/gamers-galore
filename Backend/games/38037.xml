The app has some basic tools (undo, redo, camera, marker thickness, etc.) that allow you to draw simple pictures.You can choose to draw alone or with friends, using the vita's ad hoc feature. In Paint With Friends you can draw and send picture to others in your group or draw in contests. Contests give your group a theme or object to draw. You then have a limited amount of time to draw something based on the guidelines. Once time is up, everyone's pictures are displayed and everyone votes for their favorite. The picture with the most votes wins the contest.An enhanced version called Paint Park Plus was released later, which added various new features.</description><genres /><similar_games><game id="37657">Swapnote</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/61603/2182358-7087241809_7906d7ba67_z.jpg</image></root>
