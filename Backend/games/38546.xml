Like the previous Wii Fit games, it will be compatible with the Wii Balance Board peripheral. New in this version is the ability to transfer data from a Wii Fit Meter about the player's physical activities during their daily routine into the game via the GamePad's IR-port.Wii Fit U will also be the first Wii U title to have Gym Communities in Miiverse that work similar to communities in Mario Kart 7 which any user could create and then everyone who had the ID could join. In Wii Fit U, these communities can be used to talk about one's fitness progress privately with trusted people.</description><genres><genre id="44">Fitness</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30346">EA Sports Active 2.0</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2548264-wiifitu.jpg</image></root>
