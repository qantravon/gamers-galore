<root><id>23837</id><name>Blade</name><description>Â   Overview  Blade (sometimes referred to as, "Blade: The Vampire Hunter" because of the  promotional artwork) was a proposed licensed game by Zero Gravity Entertainment  as a full fledged game to follow up their previous Marvel licensed work, the  X-Men Ravages of Apocalypce  Quake expansion. It never left the the concept stage of development for PC,  though both Dreamcast and Playstation ports were proposed.The primary  objective of the player was to halt the vampires' play to resurrect Dracula and  prevent the whole human population from turning into vampires. The game was to  be broken into four larger missions composed of smaller objectives, such as  driving between locations throughout an unnamed modern day city, visiting  Blade's warehouse and hunting for clues in addition to actually fighting  enemies. A constant theme across the missions in the game was to be saving as  many humans as possible. The more humans that were killed, the more Blade  reverted to his vampiric nature while the number of enemies throughout the later  levels would increase if humans were converted by the vampires. GameplayPlanned gameplay concepts included: third person action (both  hand to hand and weapon based), arcade style driving (car and motorcycle), light  role playing and adventuring. Missions were to be flexible enough to facilitate  pure action, pure stealth and any combination of the two with multiple possible  outcomes depending on the individual player's actions.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="35304">Daredevil: The Man Without Fear</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/670395-bladepromo.jpg</image></root>
