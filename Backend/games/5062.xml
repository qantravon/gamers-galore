The A button shoots the rail gun, and the B button shoots rockets. Power-ups are picked up by shooting them, and everything can be damaged, even buildings in the background.Terminator 2 for the Game Boy is difficult, but rewards memorization. Enemies always pop up in the same spots, and therefore the game can be made easier through repetition. Enemies include T-800s in their exoskeleton form, aircrafts that shoot destroyable bubbles at you, and bosses at the end that have multiple destructible sections and/or forms.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/1032561-585958_46691_front.jpg</image></root>
