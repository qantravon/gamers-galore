Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score, wrote, "...There are lots of wrestlers to pipick from, each being quite different from the other. Being only a two-button game does not really hinder it from being fun, but being on an 8-bit system does have its limitations -- like the occasional character [having his] legs disappearing when thrown...".Sushi-X wrote, "...The graphics are weak and lots of flicker gets annoying real fast. The game play is decent and the cart proves to be fun with two players".DevelopmentWWF King of the Ring was the last NES/GB game made by Gray Matter.During development Hulk Hogan complained about his player character's hairline so the developers added pixels to his sprite. When he complained again the developers gave him a comically full head of hair. This changed was approved.The game used two wrestler body types: fat and non-fat. One unnamed wrestler complained he had been placed in the wrong category, so he had to be remade as a non-fat character.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="10">Wrestling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3667">WWF Wrestlemania 2000</game><game id="22390">Monday Night Raw</game><game id="16684">Saturday Night Slam Masters</game><game id="775">WCW: World Championship Wrestling</game><game id="28430">WWF Royal Rumble</game><game id="42338">WCW Wrestling: The Main Event</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362625-nes_wwfkingofthering.jpg</image></root>
