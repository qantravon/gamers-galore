As the Super Solver, the player's goal is to defeat Morty Maxwell, the Master of Mischief in a national spelling bee held at the White House! But first, a series of spelling competitions must be completed at the school, city, and state-wide levels.In order to qualify for each competition the player will need to complete minigames: flashcard memorization, crossword puzzles and word searches, all of which attempt to familiarize the player with the words which will be used during the next competition. Completing minigames earns points, and once enough points are accumulated the next spelling bee will become available. During competitions, the player attempts to out-spell two of Morty's robots. If successful, the process will repeat with earning points to unlock the next level of competition, until at last the player is able to face the Master of Mischief himself.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/17/171286/2356634-img_18.png</image></root>
