The game is essentially the same as Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, except for the fact that the main character in this version is a girl.Some other small changes were also made, such as the ability to sell items directly to the character Won (a shady travelling salesman), as well as the ability to modify the colour of your clothing. Instead of the six bachelorettes that were available for marriage in Friends of Mineral Town, this version features eight bachelors that you can marry instead.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12893">Animal Crossing</game><game id="2128">John Deere: American Farmer</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2139796-box_hmmfomt.png</image></root>
