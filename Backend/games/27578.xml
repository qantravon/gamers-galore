The film's script was created by legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who died in September of 1998; the film was slated to be his son Hisao Kurosawa's directorial debut.  At the 2005 Tokyo Game Show,   Koei announced that the film was canceled due to complications, but also stated that production of the game was still underway.  Following this announcement, no new information about the game was released until a year later with the debut of a new trailer at TGS 2006.  Following TGS, Koei remained silent on the game's status until the April 2009 issue of Famitsu revealed that Ni-Oh was still in development.  At     TGS 2010, it was revealed that development of the game has been handed off to        Team Ninja, the development studio under Koei's corporate partner  Tecmo responsible for the       Dead or Alive and      Ninja Gaiden series.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20816">Dynasty Warriors 6</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1094808-gb.png</image></root>
