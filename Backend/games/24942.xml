To make an incision you must choose the pizza cutter and cut on the yellow line not missing any of the little lines otherwise resulting in a miss, loss of a combo and also hurting the patient. To patch up an incision pick up your stapler and staple the cut about 3 to 5 times until a note comes up telling you it is ready for heat and following that is the pain cream which heal the wound completely. To take things out of the body you must pick the salad tongs and place you finger on the cut. You slowly pull out the item until the pan shows up on the screen. To cut harder objects like a rib cage you use the chainsaw. Just like the pizza cutter you have a dotted line to cut. Finally to bring you patient back from cardiac arrest you use the car battery.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16944">Trauma Center: New Blood</game><game id="7184">Trauma Center: Second Opinion</game><game id="18208">Trauma Center: Under the Knife</game><game id="20620">Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2</game><game id="26696">Trauma Team</game><game id="34091">Surgery Simulator</game><game id="42129">Simple DS Series Vol. 34: The Haisha-San</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8163/846375-amateur_surgeon.jpg</image></root>
