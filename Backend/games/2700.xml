It was published by Capcom in Japan on April 22nd, 2004 and localized for North America and Europe, respectively released in each territory on July 21st, 2004 and November 5th, 2004.   The game is a weapon-based beat-em-'up that features a very distinct cel-shaded art style and is set in randomly generated, template-based dungeons. Instead of having traditionally designed levels, Spike incorporated a system that would generate a level according to certain parameters for each area of the game. There are three playable characters, each with their own distinct abilities and combat styles.   The game was received to with average reviews and was criticized for it's very repetitive nature, despite the inclusion of randomly-generated dungeons.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5276">World of Dragon Warrior: Torneko: The Last Hope</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2117016-box_ctears.png</image></root>
