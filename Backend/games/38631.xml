<root><id>38631</id><name>Magna Mundi</name><description>.Magna Mundi was a popular mod for Europa Universalis 3. Popular enough for the mod creator, Carlos 'ubik' Benavente, to be approached by Paradox Interactive for the possibility of full, commercial product being released under the name.The game passed many deadlines, and Paradox ultimately cancelled the game on June 2012, citing the lack of progress, lack of trust with the developers (though, most of the distrust is for Ubik; the rest of the developers ultimately left Universo Virtual and some have since posted that they'd be happy to be able to work on finishing the game) and internal strife within the UV team. As it stands right now, the game is cancelled and Paradox and Ubik are now preparing for legal action.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2232073-magnamundi.jpg</image></root>
