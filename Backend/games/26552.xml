Much like the Japanese company's more famous arcade and console series Punch-Out, Arm Wrestling involves players going up against various contenders in arm wrestling matches, with the opponents being various cartoony caricatures. There are a total of five opponents to fight and the game also includes low quality sound files that play during certain phases of the gameplay.GameplayArm Wresting's gameplay mostly involves holding the joystick to the left and continuously hitting the main button in order to apply more power. However, sometimes the opponents attempt to counterattack, which results in on-screen joystick direction prompts suddenly appearing; following the directions allows the player to thwart those efforts. The player can then try to press the main button several times in quick succession to apply more punishment to the opponent. The game keeps score in terms of dollars and the amount distributed is relative to how well the player performs in each match.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26551">Super Punch-Out!!</game><game id="27410">Punch-Out!!</game><game id="26386">Arm Spirit</game><game id="27378">Arm Champs II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/33787/953286-aw_1_1.jpg</image></root>
