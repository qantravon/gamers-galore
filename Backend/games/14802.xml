<root><id>14802</id><name>Custer's Revenge</name><description>OverviewCuster's Revenge is a pornographic videogame created for the Atari 2600 by Mystique. The game is quite simple; the player, as a naked General George Armstrong Custer with a blocky pixel erection, must dodge obstacles in a western setting in order to have sex with a busty, smiling, also completely naked Native American woman on the other side of the screen. Predictably, the game stirred up tons of controversy, with women's rights and Native American groups heavily condemning the game upon its release.Two variants of the game, Westward Ho and General Retreat, were released by the game company Playaround after Mystique went out of business during the games crash of 1983. Westward Ho added an animation to the Native American woman in which she waves for General Custer to have sex with her (thus silencing critics of the game who felt strongly about one of the central themes of gameplay involving possible rape), and General Retreat changed the game so that the Indian Woman had to dodge obstacles in order to have sex with General Custer.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="2378">Bachelor Party</game><game id="15214">Bubble Bath Babes</game><game id="24165">Fuck Quest</game><game id="18220">Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em</game><game id="5210">SimuSex</game><game id="6420">X-Man</game><game id="39080">Super Amazing Wagon Adventure</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15568/634750-b_custersrevenge_front.jpg</image></root>
