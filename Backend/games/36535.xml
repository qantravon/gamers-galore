The game tasks the player with building a robot from various different parts, each with unique stats and abilities. The player must then use this robot to fight other robots, which can earn the player "Real Steel Cash." This can then be used to upgrade the robot. Real Steel Cash may also be purchased with real money (on PSN) or with Microsoft Points (on XBLA.)Game ModesThe game consists of three major game modes. The first is assembly mode in which you build and customize your robot. This robot can then be taken into the other two modes. The first is Match Mode which is the player vs an AI. This mode can earn the player Real Steel Cash which can be spent on upgrading the robot, which will make it significantly easier to beat harder robots and earn larger amounts of cash.The third and final mode is the Online Multiplayer Mode, which is essentially the same as match mode but the AI is replaced with another player. As well as Real Steel Cash, the player will earn Ranking Points for winning online matches. These points will determine the players rank on three different leaderboards, the Weekly Ranking, the Total Wanking and the Friend Ranking.Official SynopsisIn the not so distant future, where the face of boxing has changed.
