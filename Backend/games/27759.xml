In an unusual move Nintendo did not announce the game at their press confrence instead choosing to focus on the then upcoming Wii. Nerveless shortly after the press briefing Nintendo put up a trailer for two Gamecube games: Kirby and Super Paper Mario. Both projects eventually were moved over to the Wii, with Super Paper Mario being released in 2007. Kirby however remained in limbo, with Nintendo never giving too many details about the game itself. Eventually the project morphed into the Wii game Kirby: Return to Dreamland which was released in 2011.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1102377-kirby1.jpg</image></root>
