Even those beside hime are no more boon companions than bondservants, summoned by sorcery and song, as cold and indifferent to him as the light of a wanderin' star. Is a Dragon terrorising the locals? He'll take care of it for the right price. Local princess held captiver? The Bard is your man as long as she's hot. Forget the quest to save the world, our hero is interested in just two things...Coin and Cleavage. The Bard's Tale is a new generation action-RPG with wicket humour and stunning graphics.</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Adventure</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/18080-1.jpg</image></root>
