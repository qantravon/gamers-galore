It focuses on the story depicted in Journey to the West, where the deposed demi-god Sun Wukong (a.k.a. The Monkey King) must escort the Buddhist monk Xuanzang from China to India while ensuring his safety. The player will also locate and recruit Xuanzang's other protectors, such as Zhu Bajie (usually called Pigsy in English translations), as the game progresses.Most of the gameplay involves travelling over vast, empty maps looking for houses and entrances to other areas. Occasionally the player will be tasked with defending Xuanzang from marauding beasts and bandits, and these involve side-scrolling action sections where Sun Wukong and his entourage fight them off. Defeating the enemies (or after enough time has passed) will bring Sun Wukong back to the map. Along the way, the player must search houses for food and water to prevent the party from starving/dehydrating to death.The game has an infamous reputation in Japan for its difficulty, its obfuscating lack of direction and its generally poor sound and graphical quality. It was never released outside its native country.</description><genres><genre id="37">Brawler</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11352">Cloud Master</game><game id="5046">Son Son</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2444106-super_monkey_daibouken_fc.jpg</image></root>
