<root><id>35960</id><name>Picross e</name><description>OverviewPicross e is a new eShop-exclusive Picross game for 3DS, developed by the same team as Nintendo's previous Picross games. Rather than the new type of Picross introduced in Picross 3D (not developed by Jupiter), this release returns to the traditional gameplay of Picross DS. 150 puzzles are included, with grid sizes 5x5, 10x10 and 15x15. Finishing a puzzle within the time limit reveals a color version, displayed in 3D. Thanks to the higher resolution of the 3DS screens, no zooming and scrolling is required for larger grids. As well as touch controls, standard button control is available.A sequel, Picross e2, has been released worldwide.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="19050">Picross DS</game><game id="30620">Pic Pic</game><game id="6316">Mario's Picross</game><game id="23984">Picross 3D</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2104/1844393-picrosse_pkg.jpg</image></root>
