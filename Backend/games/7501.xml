<root><id>7501</id><name>Stolen</name><description>The unique feature of Stolen among the other games in the stealth genre is the pacifism of the player's character Anya Romanov, a high-tech cat burglar, as she never kills anyone (well, at least until the very end of the game, when she apparently makes exception for the evil ninja chick Breeze).Anya carries a wide variety of high tech gear with her on a job, from electronics scramblers to remote activated noise makers. She is also highly athletic, and can climb along railings as well as fight hand-to-hand. As befitting her profession she is also a skilled thief, and can pick locks, crack safes, and pickpocket guards. Every guard in the game is carrying a unique piece of loot, so the persistent gamer can be rewarded with a full list of collectibles at the end of the game.</description><genres><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</game><game id="23924">Spy Fiction</game><game id="2077">The Mark of Kri</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2478701-box_stolen.png</image></root>
