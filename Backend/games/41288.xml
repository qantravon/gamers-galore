It's best known in the West as one third of the source material for the TV show Robotech, which took footage from Macross and two other mecha anime TV shows and mixed them together to form a separate show. Choujikuu Yousai Macross is the first game based on the Macross license and was developed by Namco using the licensing rights from co-publisher Bandai.The game itself doesn't focus much on the story of the anime, being as it is a straightforward side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player can transform between a jet and a robot at will. As with Formation Z, an earlier Jaleco game with a similar feature, both forms have their distinct advantages and disadvantages and it's left to player discretion for which form more befits the current stage or their personal play style. It's also one of the few shoot-em-ups of the era to have a health bar for the player's ship, rather than enforcing a one-hit kill policy.Choujikuu Yousai Macross is the first instance where Namco and Bandai worked together on a project. The two companies would later merge in 2006, becoming Namco Bandai Games.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14476">Thexder</game><game id="9633">Formation Z</game><game id="15638">Convoy no Nazo</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2417748-choujikuu_yousai_macross_fc.jpg</image></root>
