<root><id>16038</id><name>Law &amp; Order II: Double or Nothing</name><description>Law and Order: Double or Nothing is the second point and click adventure game based on the Law and Order TV series and is developed by Legacy Interactive. A well respected scientists is discovered slumped over his car steering wheel dead in front of a hotel. In the game you play along side the cast of the TV series to first solve the mystery of who committed the murder and secondly work for the D.A to put together a strong enough case to nail a guilty verdict. Law and Order copies the same style of gameplay as the first game whilst removing the unpopular time limit as well as making interviews easier and repeatable, thus making it impossible to miss out on vital pieces of evidence. The game contains as many twist and obstacles for justice as is synonymous with the TV series, make use of forensics, research and surveillance teams to gather evidence. The game uses a point system although 100% is not required to win the game. It is also possible to arrest the wrong person and have your case fall apart in court if your are not thorough enough with your detective work. Characters from the TV series include detective Lennie Briscoe, assistant D.A Serena Southerlyn and Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (all seen on the games cover). The side of the CD-ROM case has the title of the game upside down compared to every other game and DVD for some reason.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="24473">CSI: NY</game><game id="4817">L.A.
