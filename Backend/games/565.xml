While moving down the trails, gamers can do up to 20 tricks in an attempt to beat the competition. Featuring 6 different courses and five difficulty levels, players have an array of options suited for their desires. Twisted Edge Snowboarding was announced in 1997 and was eagerly anticipated by the gaming public. However in between the announcement and the game's release Nintendo released their own downhill title, 1080 Snowboarding. When Twisted was finally released it was seen as an inferior product and received a mostly lukewarm reception.Features8 riders6 mountain coursesSplit-Screen racesVariety of snowboards to choose fromHidden trails</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18946">1080° Snowboarding</game><game id="18426">Snowboard Kids 2</game><game id="18062">Snowboard Kids</game><game id="19339">1080° Avalanche</game><game id="17969">SSX Blur</game><game id="12060">Stunt Racer 64</game><game id="20880">We Ski</game><game id="42370">R: Rock'n Riders</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/233/446040-sb_box_usa_front.jpg</image></root>
