<root><id>10854</id><name>Fighting Warrior</name><description>Despite featuring a storyline, Fighting warrior plays like more like a 2-player beat em up games than a 2D sidescroller such as       Double Dragon or      Final Fight. Our hero, a sort of     Egyptian    barbarian strolls through the   desert and faces one evil human-creature  hybrid after another. The pace of the fight is slow, compared to other and especially more modern fighting games. The main method of delivering damage and defending yourself is your weapon which can be used in three forms of attack / defense, that is upper, middle and lower. You can also find special powers which might result in good or bad things.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14586">The Way of the Exploding Fist</game><game id="8604">Death Sword</game><game id="5996">Kung-Fu Master</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10026/672735-fighting_warrior.jpg</image></root>
