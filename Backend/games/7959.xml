There are also helicopters, tanks and night levels later on. Â Influential in Britain, the game has inspired modern titles - Playstation Home's XI section has a Deathchase homage, and iphone games Dead Runner and Dark Rider are clear homages to this title.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/36683/1022235-3d_deathchase_screen.gif</image></root>
