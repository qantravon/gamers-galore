He wrote, "...Ugh! This one-on-one fighting game needs better control and more fighters to choose from. Not exactly the greatest challenge either -- some fighters have unfair advantages over others and they can win almost every match. The graphics are alright, but the sound needs work".</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="4996">Barbarian</game><game id="2886">WeaponLord</game><game id="44168">Hana no Keiji: Kumo no Kanata ni</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2551701-battle_blaze_snes_us.jpg</image></root>
