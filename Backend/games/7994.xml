It is the sequel to Chaos also written by the same author. In Lords of Chaos you control a wizard casting spells to summon creatures, or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. Some spells require ingredients, and some ingredients, such as dragon herb become important strategic acquisitions. Unlike chaos the large maps scroll and are uncovered as you explore. The game can be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players. When playing single player the experience gained improves your wizard giving access to better spells and giving you the edge in multi-player battles.
