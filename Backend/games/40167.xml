Ramenman: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training.Tatakae!! Ramenman is a spin-off of the Kinnukiman franchise, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman was among the many characters of that franchise. Though the game's title screen credits a company called Shinsei as the publisher, it was a toy company with no prior game publishing that would soon be merged with Bandai, suggesting it was used in a subsidiary role by the toy-producing giant.Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they had been largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10158">M.U.S.C.L.E.</game><game id="9648">King's Quest</game><game id="14551">Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2349374-tatake___ramen_man.jpg</image></root>
