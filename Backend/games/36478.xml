<root><id>36478</id><name>City Adventure Touch: Mystery of Triangle</name><description>OverviewCity Adventure Touch: Mystery of Triangle is a brawler game based on a slice-of-life manga named Touch that follows the soapish high school struggles of a pair of twin brothers, Tatsuya and Kazuya, and their next door neighbor Minami. The story of the game has very little to do with the down-to-earth manga, instead focusing on an alternate dimension the three fall into while chasing Punch, the twins' Samoyed dog.The game plays like a prototypical brawler, with the three characters able to fight off enemies on a field with a degree of depth, similar to Double Dragon and other early brawlers of the era. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2412813-front.png</image></root>
