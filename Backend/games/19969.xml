The player takes the role of a civilian at the station to attend a Christmas party. After accidentally becoming sealed in the station's control room, the player makes contact with a woman named Rio, who is the only person left who can stop the aliens from destroying the station, and who needs the player's help to fight the aliens and find out the mystery behind their arrival.GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of voice commands. The player must instruct Rio on how to proceed through the game, including combat situations where she can be told specific alien body parts to aim for.ReceptionThe game was widely panned upon release due to the gimmicky and imprecise use of voice commands. On the January 27, 2009 Bombcast, Giant Bomb staff member Ryan Davis stated this game as his worst voice-controlled game experience ever.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26826">Milo and Kate</game><game id="17113">Hey You, Pikachu!</game><game id="1442">Seaman</game><game id="16463">N.U.D.E.
