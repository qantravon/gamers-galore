The game is loosely related to a Genisis game that came out a couple years earlier, in that both games feature similar graphical styles and similar level designs, however Treasure also adds a couple of new features that completely overhaul the gameplay. For instance each world now has an overworld which appears in the form of a map, players move on the map by rolling a dice and whatever stage they land on they have to play, Their are also Boss encounters, however these too were unique for their time in that instead of fighting the boss outright, you fought the boss by racing them in mode 7 style races.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2246784-cover_snes_flintstones_the_the_treasure_of_sierra_madrock.jpg</image></root>
