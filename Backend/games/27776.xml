The only other option available to the player on the main menu is an options menu.Once a certain point has been reached in the game, more options open up to the player. The new options available are:B-Dabattle - B-Dabattle mode is like an exhibition or single match mode in which the player can choose a multitude of settings and play a single battle that is not related to the story mode.B-Connect - B-Connect mode is the multiplayer mode.

If the A button is held it will activate a charged shot.BattlesPerforming a Special AttackIn a B-Daman battle both players select their B-Daman, which is a customize-able robot, to battle. Once both players have chosen their B-Daman, they are placed on an arena which is set up similar to that of a basketball court. Each player has their own side in which they must stay.During a battle a player can move right, left, or forward slightly. On both the left and right sides are a stockpile of balls. These balls are what the B-Daman shoots at the opposing player. Each time a ball hits a B-Daman a small amount of health will be drained. If a ball misses a B-Daman, the player whose side it went to will receive that ball in one of their stockpiles. When a players ball count reaches zero the B-Daman needs to sit on a stockpile to recharge them. If no balls are in the stockpile then that player must wait until the opponent shoots a ball and misses.With every successful hit of the opponent a special move gauge will fill. Once that meter is full a special attack move can be performed. How the attack is performed depends on the special move that the player equipped to their B-Daman.Once it has been acquired in the game, a strike shot attack is also made available. The strike shot attack is used by holding down the A button until the aiming sight turns red, and then releasing it. Strike shots have a finite amount of times they can be used in an entire round, if they are depleted they cannot be used again until another round.LocationsAn Example of One of the Locations OptionsUpon approaching a town or other location the player has multiple options available to them.
