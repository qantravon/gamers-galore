The game has three playable characters: Chill, Roxy (Jammit's lone female character) and Slade. The unselected characters serve as opponents.The single-player mode consists of a series of one-on-one hoops battles, involving $100, $200 or $300 wagers on each game. A combination of victories and earnings will unlock the game of Cutthroat; a victory in Cutthroat will prompt a game versus the game's boss (The Judge) at his home court (The Palace).Jammit is one of only a handful of games to feature an in-game Bass Boost option so that players can "turn on the bass back beat for the most happenin' music effects", according to the game's manual.Jammit also features a trash talk toggle; players can choose to play the game with no trash talk, some trash talk, or lots of trash talk.
