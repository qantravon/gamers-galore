<root><id>35867</id><name>WWE Brawl</name><description>WWE Brawl was announced the day before Wrestlemania 27. However, no mention was publicly made until the trailer showed up on YouTube early July. The trailer has since been removed from THQ's official YouTube channel and all mentions of the game have been stripped from their site. The game is, therefore, vaporware, and was possibly cancelled in light of THQ's financial problems throughout 2011 and/or due to poor sales of WWE All Stars.Everything known about the game is drawn entirely from the trailer. While it will feature WWE Superstars, it appears that will be the only link as each person appears to have magical attacks.RosterEdgeJohn CenaKelly KellyThe MizSheamusTriple HThe UndertakerIt is also rumored that this game will tie in with a toy line and new Saturday morning animated TV show.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1837968-wwebrawl.png</image></root>
