The game has been successful within the robot building crowd stating that RA DD is a "pretty much accurate simulator of building a bot". The game was also one of the first to introduce the Havok physics engine in a video game. The physics proved to be unstable because of the tweaking that the developers have added to it. The game has been a commercial failure, even when critics have had a mixed reactions. Online Tournaments The game had host 2 major online tournaments, both which were successful and had a lot of support, and a lot of players online. However, not all tournaments related to robots fighting, some had "sprint" challenges, and putting balls in to baskets. The issue was the fact that the game did not allow you to switch between robots in tournaments, meaning that you were allowed to use only one robot for a lot of functions. </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="3257">Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction</game><game id="10250">Robot Wars 2: Extreme Destruction</game><game id="19360">Robot Wars: Advanced Destruction</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/330/697361-robot_arena.jpg</image></root>
