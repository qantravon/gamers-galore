<root><id>9601</id><name>Radar Lock</name><description>OverviewRadar Lock is a game that is similar to After Burner in terms of its control style, but differed graphically from that title due to its release as a home console game on the Atari 2600 as opposed to an arcade release. The game used two joysticks to play when it was released for the 2600 and featured guns and missiles as weapons. It also featured mid-air refueling sequences in order to progress from level to level.TriviaJeff Gerstmann is convinced that the theme song to Radar Lock's commercials was a parody of "Radar Love" by Golden Earring.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14975/1341634-radarboxart2.jpg</image></root>
