Elements from the Airwolf license have been removed or modified such as the Airwolf theme music that would play during the vertical helicopter shooting segments as well as the commander who gave the player instructions. Gameplay, levels, and weapon upgrades remained the same.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8303/1274487-crossfire_gen1.png</image></root>
