The player can move one ball each turn, and only if there is a clear path between the ball and its destination. After each turn, three more balls appear, with their colors announced beforehand at the top of the screen. If the player manages to match five or more balls in a row, column or diagonal, an extra move can be performed. The game is over when the board is full. If the player gets the high score, they get their name to be displayed for every subsequent contender under the column with the regal figure on the left.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23223/1683058-i_screen1_1_.jpg</image></root>
