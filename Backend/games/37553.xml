The game is currently in closed beta with no release date as of yet.GameplaySins of a Dark Age follows the typical trapping of games like Dota 2 or League of Legends with some specific twists. The first twist on the gameplay is "realm quests" which is a system to try and force players into combat with one another more often. Another system that has since been removed was the commander system, in which one player takes control of the minions, which in other games are typically AI controlled. This idea has been removed as the developers felt it didn't work. The commnader system may be reworked and added in later or it may be left out of the game entirely. </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre><genre id="12">Real-Time Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/88377/2134855-soda_website_media_veric.jpg</image></root>
