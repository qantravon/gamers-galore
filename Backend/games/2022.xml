It focuses on the early years of Jesus' life. The game is broken up into three segments. The soundtrack for the game consists of three public domain songs: "We Three Kings", "Go Tell It On the Mountain", and "What Child Is This."The Wise MenYou play as one of the three Wise Men as they journey to visit baby Jesus. Each Wise Man rides a spitting camel and collects their respective gifts (frankincense, gold, and myrrh) as they roam through the treacherous side-scrolling desert landscape.Flight to EgyptJoseph, Mary and Jesus are fleeing from King Harrod on the back of a donkey. The player guides the donkey up a steep, zig-zagging, vertical maze.Jesus and the TempleOh no! 12-year-old Jesus is alone at the Temple in Jerusalem. You play as Joseph as he hurries to find him. This is the only mode in the collection that does not feature the characters riding animals.</description><genres><genre id="8">Educational</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18981">Bible Adventures</game><game id="22828">Sunday Funday: The Ride</game><game id="8222">Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho</game><game id="18007">Spiritual Warfare</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3413/218890-king_of_kings_ver_1.jpg</image></root>
