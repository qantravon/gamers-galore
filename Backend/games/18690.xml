The player is given the ability to use the "tractor beam" that was used to capture your ship in the first game. The player could potentially capture a large amount of enemy ships to fight along side their ship.Galaga 3 also has "time warp" areas, where instead of your ship moving forward, your ship moves backwards and the Galaga swarms are more frenzied as they attack your ship.TriviaThere isn't a game named Galaga 2 in existence. However, if one counts Galaxian as the original Galaga, then Galaga becomes the second game in the series followed by Galaga 3.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21465">Retro Game Challenge</game><game id="11959">Invasion of the Mutant Space Bats of Doom</game><game id="33855">Cosmo Gang: The Video</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2579/1710632-vc______.jpg</image></root>
