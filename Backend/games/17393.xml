In addition, the player can collect a  power-up where a partner will come to offer aid by covering   The Tick's back. The player can also use a special move where The Tick calls for assistance from his flying friend Arthur, and Arthur will come sweeping down clearing the screen of enemies.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14351">Golden Axe</game><game id="2793">Splatterhouse 2</game><game id="534">Splatterhouse 3</game><game id="6531">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</game><game id="29491">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</game><game id="20733">Castle Crashers</game><game id="22857">Battletoads</game><game id="20752">Double Dragon</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2389515-genesis_thetick.jpg</image></root>
