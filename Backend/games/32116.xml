Taking a page from Konami's Parodius playbook, Jaleco delivers a shooter with a sense of humor. Game Tengoku, a.k.a. Game Paradise, flies you through the world of Japanese arcades while blowing up a variety of game related enemies. Stages flick between an 8-bit invasion to an assault on a karoke bar. It's otaku overload! </description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/98709/1441574-gametengoku_box_f.jpg</image></root>
