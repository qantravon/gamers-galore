<root><id>1873</id><name>WCW/nWo Thunder</name><description>FeaturesThe game, though largely unchanged from its predecessor WCW Nitro, added battle royals, cage matches, as well as weapons. The roster of playable wrestlers was updated and increased, and players could move wrestlers from one faction to another (for example, moving Goldberg to nWo).ReceptionThe game did not review especially well, for many of the same reasons that Nitro was not successful. Many criticisms were based on how similar the game was to the previous game. The game controlled poorly and had sub-par graphics, two qualities that are supposed to be improved in a sequel.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre><genre id="10">Wrestling</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18801">WWF War Zone</game><game id="30637">Lucha Libre AAA Heroes del Ring</game><game id="13440">Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2409918-box_wcwnwot.png</image></root>
