<root><id>38144</id><name>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of Lounge Lizards RELOADED</name><description>OverviewLeisure Suit Larry Reloaded is an updated point-and-click version of the original. Along with updating the visuals and the sound, Replay Games has eliminated the penalty for death (when you die, you start at a safe point before the cause of death) and for losing all your money. The controls are similar to those found in Leisure Suit Larry VI - by right clicking, you switch through options like Look, Use, Unzip, Smell/Taste, or whatever inventory item you currently are holding.The series' raunchy humor has also been updated for 2013, and while the set-up for the gags is still essentially the same, specific lines have been altered to reflect the passage of time since the original game's release. The game follows the misadventures of Larry Laffer, a "loveable loser" as the series is fond of calling him. Larry arrives in the city of Lost Wages looking to lose his virginity and possibly find love.The game was the result of a successful Kickstarter campaign.System RequirementsPCOS: Win 7, Vista and XPProcessor: 1.8 or 2.5 GhzMemory: 2 GB RAM (4 GB RAM)Graphics: Direct X 9.0c or Direct X 9.0c compatible video card with 256 MB RAMDirectXÂ®: 9.0cHard Drive: 4 GB HD spaceMacOS: Mac OS X or BetterProcessor: Intel 1.8Ghz or higherMemory: 4 GB RAMHard Drive: 4 GB HD space</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9038">Softporn Adventure</game><game id="9648">King's Quest</game><game id="2634">Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier</game><game id="9815">Space Quest II: Chapter II - Vohaul's Revenge</game><game id="152">Police Quest 3: The Kindred</game><game id="2912">Police Quest 2: The Vengeance</game><game id="147">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</game><game id="12901">Daryl F.
