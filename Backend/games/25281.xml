<root><id>25281</id><name>Unbound Saga</name><description>Unbound Saga is a digital only release for the PSP, which is based on a comic book series. The game can be seen somewhat of an updated version of    Comix Zone, as, like in that game, your character hops from panel to panel fighting enemies as they are drawn on screen. Unlike Comix Zone, however, the game al.ows you to move along the Y axis, giving it a similar feel to something like a   Final Fight, or a  Double Dragon, as opposed to Comix Zone which was strictly a side scrolling affair. Also the game used polygonal graphics as opposed to 2D sprites.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1416">Comix Zone</game><game id="21173">MadWorld</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1630676-usaga_box.png</image></root>
