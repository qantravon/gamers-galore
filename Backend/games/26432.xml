Go Low - In which you can only score points for getting lines in the bottom four of the play field, and hard dropping. Cascade - Played marathon style, except there is no sticky Tetris gravity and tetromino squares that are not connected to anything will continue to fall. Which in turn creates chain reactions. Hotline - There are 8 colored lines on the grid, these are which you score more points in for clearing lines upon them. Cascade gravity is also in effect during this mode. Ultra - A race against the clock, with one, three and five minute games to choose from. Eraser - Similar to Hotline, the goal is to quickly get lines on predetermined sections of the grid. Getting a line on one of these erases it from play. Once all are erased you have won and your time is shown.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2266547-box_tetrisevo.png</image></root>
