Game features such as a simple cover based shooting system and blindfire mechanics facilitate the player's jaunt through the streets of a futuristic Moscow. Ghost Recon features a co-op option throughout the campaign, allowing a second player to jump in and out of the action at any point. Two players can also go head to head in the arcade mode and compete for who can achieve the highest score.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre><genre id="11">Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="26423">Call of Duty: Black Ops</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1783145-box_wiigr.png</image></root>
