It features a 15 level quest mode where the player is tasked with saving a vaguely 1970s British town from rampaging Vikings, and various multiplayer modes with up to 4 players local or online across both PS3s and Vitas.GameplayThe gameplay consists the player of growing his mob of people by collecting neutral individuals, while depleting his opponents mob by throwing items at it. The larger a mob, the larger the items it can throw, however as a mob grows it also moves slower. When faced with an incoming projectile, the player can dash away, or attempt to catch it.
