The game was designed by Barry Oursler and Bill Pfutzenreuter, and the music was composed by Jon Hey. The manufacturer produced 7,752 unites throughout the tableâ€™s run, and the first 100 tables featured a Dalek topper that would animate during the game.The game features three flippers, and a three level rising and falling playfield. Similar to tables like Pinbot, one of the primary objectives in Dr. Who is to lock multiple balls in the upper middle playfield (a recreation of the TARDIS), causing it to rise and reveal additional bumpers, and then again to reveal three holes.The game incorporates the Dr. Who fiction by featuring the first seven Doctors, each of whom can be selected by players upon launching a new ball, and each of whom provide different bonuses. The primary objective is to repair the TARDIS, destroy the Daleks and battle with The Master.</description><genres><genre id="30">Pinball</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="37171">Doctor Who Episode 5: The Gunpowder Plot</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1781483-drwho.jpg</image></root>
