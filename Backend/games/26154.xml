In Hinterland, the objective is to lead a group of peasants to establish a new city in a fantasy kingdom. Players must select which peasants to send out into the wild, brimming with many creatures of myth and folklore, to collect much needed resources to expand their city. Careful decisions must be made, as even the loss of a simple farmer can result in a crisis when the city is in demand of food. </description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="11345">Depths of Peril</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3948/965374-958753_122110_front.jpg</image></root>
