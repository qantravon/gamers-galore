It spawned the Dynasty Warriors name, but is vastly different from the franchise most know it as. Nonetheless, it retains the same Three Kingdoms storyline and many of the more popular characters such as  Zhao Yun,  Zhou Yu, and  Xiahou Dun. GameplayThe gameplay in Dynasty Warriors is similar to  Soul Calibur or  Soul Blade. Two warriors square off with their weapons in a 3D arena, performing special moves and combos. Introduced here as its super meter is the Musou gauge, which allows for more powerful attacks. Japanese releaseThe disparity between the numbers of the Dynasty Warriors franchise in Japan and elsewhere is due to this first title being named "Sangoku Musou" in Japanese and Dynasty Warriors 2 named "Shin Sangoku Musou." Subsequent Shin Sangoku Musou sequels were thus numbered "one behind" Western releases.</description><genres><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="707">Virtua Fighter 5</game><game id="10081">Tekken</game><game id="12411">Soulcalibur</game><game id="18604">Sango Fighter</game><game id="13368">Sango Fighter 2</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1820008-box_dw.png</image></root>
