<root><id>4798</id><name>The Sentinel</name><description>Â The surreal premise of the game is explained minimally, the player controls a conciousness that inhabits an immobile vessel called a Synthoid, it can look around the multi tiered 3D chequerboard world, but can't move. What it can do is absorb  create objects (which gains  spends energy respectively) that are on a square that he can see the entirety of (that is, it can't absorb or create anything on a square above its line of sight.) or on one of the platforms he's created called Boulders. The player can also create more Synthoids,  can instantaneously transfer the conciousness to it, at which time it will be facing it's now unused synthoid which it will most likely absorb, along with what ever else it can see from the new vantage. The players goal is to transfer itself into the eponymous Sentinel at the highest point on each map where it can Hyperspace to a new level. The Sentinel is systematically turning in place  scanning its field of view for anything with more than 1 point of energy (everything except Trees) it absorbs any such object it  redistributes the energy as Trees around the level.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="10161">Sentinel Returns</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8273/658579-1176554246_00.png</image></root>
