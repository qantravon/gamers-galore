<root><id>21446</id><name>Tales of the Tempest</name><description>OverviewTales of the Tempest was the first Nintendo DS entry in the action RPG series by Namco. The game was developed by Dimps with music by the Tales Studio's sound staff and was published in Japan by Namco on October 26, 2006. Tempest was originally released as a "Mothership Title" in the Tales series but because of the game's poor reception it has since been demoted to a "Escort Title." An unofficial English translation patch for Tales of the Tempest was created by Absolute Zero Translations which was released on April Fools Day in 2013.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21371">Avalon Code</game><game id="21633">Soma Bringer</game><game id="24226">Legacy of Ys: Books I &amp; II</game><game id="24225">Destiny Links</game><game id="22015">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</game><game id="24247">Dengeki Gakuen RPG: Cross of Venus</game><game id="23621">Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier</game><game id="28913">Mugen no Frontier EXCEED: Super Robot Wars OG Saga</game><game id="29252">Keroro RPG: Kishi to Busha to Densetsu no Kaizoku</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/112/293189-931115_72137_front.jpg</image></root>
