Loosely based on the 1995 film of the same name, up to two players team up as either Batman or his sidekick Robin as they set out to foil the plans of criminal Two-Face and puzzler The Riddler.Unlike the version released for fifth-generation consoles, this version features a faster-paced arcade-style system with a traditional beat 'em up style, featuring random power-ups anda a combo system.In late 1996, the game was released on the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC as Batman Forever: The Arcade Game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9710">Batman Returns</game><game id="6722">Final Fight</game><game id="20436">Streets of Rage</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2280546-box_bftag.png</image></root>
