The gameplay of Splatterhouse 2 is virtually identical to its predecessor: run through myriad horror-themed levels, killing myriad monsters with any weapon you can find--or your bare hands. Each level ends with a grotesque    boss creature for Rick to slay, just like the original  Splatterhouse.The story in Splatterhouse 2 involves the mask informing Rick that Jennifer is still alive and makes him return to the ruins of  West Mansion in an attempt to save her.        Much of the plot was lost during the game's Western localisation (from the Japanese Splatterhouse Part 2). One of the things lost in translation was an explanation why there seems to be a new        West Mansion beyond the one that burnt down in        the first game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="37">Brawler</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17393">The Tick</game><game id="534">Splatterhouse 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2374526-genesis_splatterhouse2_cropped.jpg</image></root>
