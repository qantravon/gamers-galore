In the game the player is not driving cars, but rather controlling radio-controlled vehicles. The game is played from an isometric perspective, giving the game a pseudo 3Dlook. The player can only see a small section of the track around them. There is also a minimap at the bottom of the screen showing the entire course and locations of all of the cars. The player can also use weapons to temporarily disable the other cars so that the player can pass them. R.C. Pro-Am was actually the first racing game to have sections of track that give the player a speed boost, rather than speed power ups that are collected. There are also numerous hazards scattered through out the tracks that can slow the player down.The game was followed by Super R.C. Pro-Am for the Game Boy in 1991.HazardsOil Slick - When driven over, these make the cars spin out and lose control. Water Puddle - When driven over, these make the cars slow down.
