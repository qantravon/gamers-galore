To do this, more attention was payed to the speed and movements of the game and some basic rules were followed such as the first team to fifteen points wins a game as long as they have a two point advantage and best three out of five wins the match. The player may choose one of two main modes available. These modes are a two-on-two outdoor game and a six-on-six  game in a gymnasium. There is also a special two-player mode to allow player-on-player matches or two players to go up against the computer. The player controls one character at a time but can switch between any available characters at any time.</description><genres><genre id="3">Sports</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="5902">Volleyball</game><game id="4723">RealSports Volleyball</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2348425-spike.png</image></root>
