<root><id>12720</id><name>Narbacular Drop</name><description>OverviewNarbacular Drop is a puzzle game developed as a senior project by students at DigiPen institute of technology. The team that worked on this game eventually got hired by Valve to create Portal, a spiritual successor to Narbacular Drop. Therefore, a lot of similar ideas and concepts can be seen in both games.The player plays as a princess named "No-knees" (this name implies her inability to jump), who is captured and stuck inside of a creature that has the ability to make portals. Without the ability to shoot or jump, the player is able to open up two gates that are interconnected. These gates operate like portals: whatever goes in one end comes out the other. You can place these portals anywhere as long as it's part of a natural material, which excludes lava and metal.The game is more of a proof of concept rather than an actual game, however there is a community of people making custom maps for it and doing speed runs of crate runs.TriviaAs a tribute to Narbacular Drop, one of the Achievements of Portal 2 is called "Narbacular Drop." It is unlocked by opening a portal under the feet of your co-op partner while they are performing an emote animation.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21169">Portal: Still Alive</game><game id="21170">Portal</game><game id="35048">Portal: The Flash Version</game><game id="36234">Quantum Conundrum</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/1886857-narbacular_drop.jpg</image></root>
