The game featured you playing as the titular cat, who was armed with a vacuum cleaner-like device he could use to suck up garbage and throw it back at enemies. In addition, Blinx had the power of time on his side; by collecting a certain number of time icons (which look like buttons on a VCR) he could activate certain time powers. Each icon represented one time power and each item must be picked up consecutively without picking up another time power in order for it to work.Time PowersPause: Stops time brieflyRewind: Reverse time, allowing Blinx to cross obstacles like crumbling bridgesFast Forward: Speeds up time, allowing Blinx to pass slow moving obstaclesRecord: Lets Blinx to make a copy of himselfReceptionThe game received mixed reviews from critics, though it was successful enough to support a 2004 sequel.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13169">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</game><game id="3684">Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</game><game id="1605">I-Ninja</game><game id="18376">Looney Tunes Back in Action</game><game id="7914">Voodoo Vince</game><game id="20584">Sonic the Hedgehog</game><game id="2906">Psychonauts</game><game id="6338">TimeShift</game><game id="8035">Dr. Muto</game><game id="23397">The Kore Gang: Outvasion from Inner Earth</game><game id="35586">Blades of Time</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2275974-box_blinx.png</image></root>
