The game forgoes typical RPG conventions such as experience points; likely a homage to the lack of modern first-person shooter systems like regenerating health in the main Serious Sam games.GameplayBattles take place with Sam "Serious" Stone and his party running backwards towards the right of the screen while enemies flood in from the left. At the start of the fight the enemies and Sam's party freeze in place and the player is asked to select weapons for the party and designate where to shoot. Players are also able to use items to help the party in various way such as refiling health and shields or increasing the damage of all weapons for one turn. The game then resumes the action with the party firing their weapons automatically and players have to move the party up and down to dodge incoming missiles and enemies in melee range. After five seconds the action freezes again to allow players to switch weapons and adjust their aim before resuming. This cycle repeats until either Sam's party is knocked out or all enemies are defeated.WeaponsMany of the weapons iconic to the Serious Sam games are included in The Random Encounter. To accommodate the turn-based fighting system they have unique abilities and firing patterns.The player carefully readies his missile salvoRevolver: Fires at the closest enemy.Shotgun: Players designate how close enemies must close in before the party member will fire on them.Minigun: Fires in a straight line.
