<root><id>5198</id><name>Air Bucks</name><description>Overview:Air Bucks was one of the first airline business simulations ever released and was amongst a handful of original titles released by the then fledgling Impressions Software. Released in 1992 to positive reviews, the game gave the user a very in depth insight into running an airline and all the pitfalls involved in running said airline. The game begins immediately after World War II in 1946 and as airline founder and general manager, you had to arrange plane purchases, airline routes, airport slots all with a $100,000 start up money. As the game progressed, real world events, new competitors (human or computer), new plane stock, worker strikes and seat pricing wars would make the game a very tough challenge. Updates: A second version was released called Air Bucks v1.2 due to several bugs in the original version of the game which made the difficulty somewhat easier also.</description><genres><genre id="7">Simulation</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1987/659725-airbfront.jpg</image></root>
