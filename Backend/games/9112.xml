Instead of a turban and beat up hubcaps, you get to wear trendy clothing and have a blinged out ride. You drive your patrons from location to location in the hopes of getting the most money possible in a given time limit. Your time increases with every patron you please and sometimes you get bonuses for getting patrons to their destination very quickly.GameplayIn Crazy Taxi, the player can chose one of four cabbies to pick people up and dive them from one destination to another. You have to get to your destinations as quickly as possible to maximize the amount of money you get from a rider. The clock is constantly against you, as it is always ticking down. While, you'll have to dodge cars and hit jumps to get around as quickly as possible. The game also has several abilities the player can use during gameplay. One of them is the "Crazy Drift", it's perform by pressing reverse then the drive button while turning the car--it's useful for getting through tight corners.The other is the "Crazy Boost", it's perform by pressing the reverse then the drive button quickly--it's a good way to speed the car up.Crazy Taxi includes many real-world brands and franchises like Tower Records, Pizza Hut and Fila. Many assume that the inclusion of these were paid advertising, in fact SEGA paid to include these brands. Kenji Kanno, "We really wanted to make the player feel like they were driving in the real world, and felt that including the franchises was a good way of achieving this".CharactersB.D. JoeB.D. JoeB.D. Joe is a gleeful man who greatly enjoys his job. He wouldn't give up his taxi for anything in the world. Except maybe a more pimped out taxi. Which he would then probably go driving around picking up customers. Well, you can't fault the guy for being dedicated.Plate #: 2HOP260Age: 25AxelAxelAxel is cool dude with an attitude. He seems pretty nice, but can be bossy when in a hurry. He sports green, spikey hair and shows off his six pack o' abs. Which makes him awesome by 1999 (arcade release) standards.Plate #: 1NOM155Age: 21GenaGinaGena is a sassy gal who could drive a man crazy, but would rather drive fools around town for some cash!Plate #: 5EXY5155Age: 23GusGusGus may not be as young as the other cabbies, but experience comes with his age.
