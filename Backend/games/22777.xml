In is published for western distribution by K2 Network, based in Irvine, California. The game differs from many of the other "swords and sorcery" games of its genre by utilizing a unique art style influenced by the Baroque period of Europe. Granado Espada distinguishes itself from other MMORPGs through its intuitive MCC, or Multiple Character Control system. Rather than controlling a singular character arrayed across multiple character accounts, the player takes control of up to 3 characters at once, which is part of a larger collective pool of playable characters called a "family" who are drawn from your Quarters. Any member of your family can be selected to part of your current roster, regardless of differences in levels or classes. The game offers a variety of quick access modes that serve as the party's AI. While the platyer is primarily responsible for controlling the lead character, the other two characters can act and adapt to various situations based on the mode that you set. These modes include Assault, Hold, Harvest and Defend.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21308">Aion: Ascension</game><game id="29355">Tera</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14761/442417-ge_logo.png</image></root>
