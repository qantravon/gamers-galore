The enemies encountered include a large array of alien ships and creatures which try to collide into your ship or shoot you down. Luckily, throughout each stage power-ups are collected by shooting down certain color enemies. Power-ups are saved up on a power meter on the bottom of the player's screen. Once a player reaches the power-up cell that they wish to buy, it can be obtained by pressing the select button (NES release). The power-up cells include:Speed Up: Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper. Missile: Adds dropping missiles to kill ground targets to your attack.Double: Shoots two cannon shots at once rather than one shot.Laser: Replaces the standard cannon shot with a laser beam.Option: Creates a hovering orange ball that follows the Vic Viper doubling its firepower with each Option.?: Provides a  shield on the front of the ship.At the end of each stage a boss battle takes place where, more often than not, you must shoot at its core to destroy it. Many of these bosses have shields that protect their core that the player must destroy before being able to lay waste to the core itself.TriviaThe NES version was the first game to ever include the  Konami code.</description><genres><genre id="48">Shoot 'Em Up</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="13960">Life Force</game><game id="13745">R-Type</game><game id="2253">Astro Boy: Omega Factor</game><game id="5015">Psyvariar: Complete Edition</game><game id="6596">Psyvariar 2</game><game id="119">Söldner-X: Himmelsstürmer</game><game id="810">Parodius</game><game id="1497">WarTech: Senko no Ronde</game><game id="4709">Hyper Dyne: Side Arms</game><game id="12069">Ikaruga</game><game id="12266">Arrow Flash</game><game id="21705">DoDonPachi</game><game id="21737">Carrier Air Wing</game><game id="1432">Section-Z</game><game id="494">G Darius</game><game id="21861">Twinbee</game><game id="3007">R-Type Delta</game><game id="19750">R-Type II</game><game id="8479">Super R-Type</game><game id="9647">Sol Divide</game><game id="11556">Andro Dunos</game><game id="3458">R-Type III: The Third Lightning</game><game id="5273">The Last Starfighter</game><game id="18465">Zombie Nation</game><game id="4252">Last Hope</game><game id="91">B-Wings</game><game id="14539">Astro Warrior</game><game id="22880">Macross 2036</game><game id="16079">Stinger</game><game id="23376">The Fourth Generation</game><game id="16984">Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol. 3: Sol Divide &amp; Dragon Blaze</game><game id="12471">Thunder Force II</game><game id="20364">Zero Wing</game><game id="15244">Bio-Hazard Battle</game><game id="5412">Darius+</game><game id="9098">R-Types</game><game id="25243">Shooting Love, 200X</game><game id="18519">Phalanx</game><game id="21825">Viewpoint</game><game id="11684">Contra: Shattered Soldier</game><game id="22998">R-Type Dimensions</game><game id="22409">Salamander 2</game><game id="25802">Sagaia</game><game id="15505">Biometal</game><game id="14662">Scramble</game><game id="4422">Burai Fighter</game><game id="12192">Axelay</game><game id="309">Sqoon</game><game id="30594">Aldynes</game><game id="28233">Progear</game><game id="31494">Crisis Force</game><game id="28120">Söldner-X 2: Final Prototype</game><game id="31643">Hydorah</game><game id="13656">Sexy Parodius</game><game id="30183">Shoot 1UP</game><game id="32664">Star Crisis</game><game id="4336">Zynaps</game><game id="32891">Darius</game><game id="15415">Harmful Park</game><game id="11102">Over Horizon</game><game id="15250">Dead Moon</game><game id="32798">A Shooter</game><game id="20222">Soldier Blade</game><game id="17225">Ziriax</game><game id="1720">Delta</game><game id="32392">Who's That Flying?!</game><game id="31791">Night Slave</game><game id="35567">PixelJunk SideScroller</game><game id="12404">Philosoma</game><game id="7717">Legendary Wings</game><game id="37943">Net Guardian: Dai Kyo Utage</game><game id="5164">Advanced Busterhawk Gleylancer</game><game id="39433">Star Beast</game><game id="8092">Starship Hector</game><game id="39936">Flying Hero</game><game id="40407">Rabbit Punch</game><game id="40523">Frog Fractions</game><game id="10259">Silpheed</game><game id="34857">StreetPass Mii Plaza</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361769-nes_gradius_3.jpg</image></root>
