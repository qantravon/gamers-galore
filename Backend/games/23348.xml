The game play about "horror pictures" that you should "clean" the ghost part of the picture by "burning" (?) it. Just do simple act, slide the stylus pen on touch screen to "burn" ghost section of the picture, but, believe me, it's HARD to finish it. You should do "exact", not more not less! Beside the hard aspect of this game, this game has "real" sense of gameplay, since they use "real photos", but I believe the ghost section it's just computer manipulation, just like fake horror pictures that you ever might heard before outside there, remember this is just game, off course, "kono ge-mu ha FIKUSHON desu" (this game just fiction)....the truth is out there....hahahahahhaa</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5645/556456-miteha_ikenai.png</image></root>
