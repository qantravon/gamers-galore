Your code name is Time Lord. Your mission: blast into the past to save the present from certain doom! Battle the aliens in 4 historical time zones. Search for weapons sent back by the scientists-and decide when to use them. Solve puzzles to collect the mysterious Orbs that hold the secret of time travel. Be cautious yet quick, Time Lord. You have 1 short year to free history or be history!
