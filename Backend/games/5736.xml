<root><id>5736</id><name>Hugo III: Jungle of Doom</name><description>In the third game in the  Hugo series,     Hugo and    Penelope crash-land their plane just outside of the infamous Jungle of Doom, and although they escape the crash unscathed, Penelope is quickly bitten by a fatally venomous spider. Now Hugo, appropriately dressed up like a jungle adventurer, must venture into the dreaded rain forest and retrieve some fabled sacred water, the only thing that can save his love. Unlike the first two games in the series, it is impossible for Hugo to actually die in Hugo III: The Jungle of Doom, ironic considering the dangerous setting. However, it  is possible for the player to get stuck in such a way that it is impossible to win, such as by drinking the aforementioned sacred water  after the path back to the holy pool has been closed.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="6072">Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (In Several Wrong Places)</game><game id="9527">Flight of the Amazon Queen</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8960/1717177-hugo_iii_cover.jpg</image></root>
