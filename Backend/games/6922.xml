Like the previous game in the series, it featured Full Motion Video starring Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies and Mark Hamill all reprising their roles as Tolwyn, Paladin and Blair respectively. These FMVs were filmed using real sets (on a budget of $12 million dollars) instead of the bluescreen techniques used in the previous game. For a while, it was considered to be the most expensive video game ever made. StoryBlair encounters "Seether"   The War with the       Kilrathi Empire is finally over. Peace has at long last come to the Terran Confederation. Things are not all well though. Tensions are higher than ever between the Border Worlds and the Inner Worlds of the Confederation. An open attack on a Medical transport by unknown fighters occurs with a bizarre new anti-ship weapon being used to destroy everything in the general vicinity.  The "savior" of the Confederation,       Christopher Blair, is trying to live out his life as a farmer on a desert world. An "old friend" from the Kilrathi war,       Todd "Maniac" Marshall, soon comes with good news for him: He's been recalled to active military duty by order of Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn himself. Maniac is unfortunately unable to share many details about the recall order. However, Blair soon realizes what he's in for when the space station the two head towards comes under attack. The attacking fighter in question claims allegiance to the "Union of Border Worlds" and takes off.Characters  Confederation PilotsMost of the characters from the third game make a return.
