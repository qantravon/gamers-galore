The protagonist - a large blue creature named Berk - has to satisfy the needs of a mysterious entity known as "The Thing Upstairs" (only his voice is "heard" during the game). In order to complete the Thing's tasks Berk needs to manipulate (e.g. when the player is asked for a can of worms he has to find the right container, catch the worms, put them into the can and deliver the package upstairs with an elevator) the objects  scattered around the castle in which the entore game takes place. The Trap Door features a clever hint system - a talking skull named Boni assists Berk whenever it's picked up.    Boni's ready to fly away.       The game features 2 difficulty levels (Learner  Super Berk)  and it was followed by a sequel releasen in 1987, entitled Through The Trap Door.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="16204">Through the Trap Door</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7930/645999-the_trap_door__alternative_software__eu_box_art.jpg</image></root>
