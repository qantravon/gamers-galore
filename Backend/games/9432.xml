These monsters were powerful creatures who were waging a fierce war against each other, and destroying the world in the process. The people of the planet could only watch on for three years as these monsters were destroying everything. The battle waged on until only the three strongest monsters were left standing.At last in 1999 a new group of monsters showed up to challenge for control of the planet. These new monsters would battle the previous ones to see who would become the king of the monsters.GameplayThe mechanics of the game allow for basic punches and kicks, but the biggest damage comes from throws. When a player approaches a similarly sized opponent, this will result in the two grappling. The winner of the struggle throws his opponent. Against the computer, the grappling system is rather unbalanced and it is difficult to come out of a grapple victorious, especially against the later bosses of the game. Each stage of the game must be completed within a set time limit and every stage has a boss characters at the end.Playable CharactersAtomic Guy, a humanoid superhero resembling UltramanCyber Woo, a robot that resembles a giant gorillaSuper Geon, a large reptilian mutantGame ModesPlayer vs. computer - The single player story mode; a second player can join in.Two players vs. computer - Two players team up to cooperatively play through the story mode.Player 1 Vs.
