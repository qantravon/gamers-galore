Hirohiko Araki, creator of JJBA, refused to change character names for the localization, and thus its release in North America was cancelled.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18647">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149200/2134383-jojo.jpg</image></root>
