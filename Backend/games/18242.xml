<root><id>18242</id><name>Pong Kombat</name><description>Pong Kombat was a parody game made by  Stefan Gagne in 1994 for a computer class assignment at Quince Orchard High school. It was primarily Pong with super moves, fatalities and stage fatalities in the vein of the Mortal Kombat series.   It was mainly shared via BBS and computer discs before wide spread use of the internet. Popularity of the game caused a tremendous amount of email and snail mail, asking for more. Stefan has stated that he would never make a sequel although a couple other people made updates to the game. Unfortunately, the game most likely does not work on modern PCs at this time.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17172/934403-pongkombat.jpg</image></root>
