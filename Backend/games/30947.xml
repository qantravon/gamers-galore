Like its predecessor, Shred makes use of the skateboard peripheral controller originally designed by the developer to emulate the act, and feel of skateboarding on an actual board. Additionally, Shred now includes a brand new Snowboarding mode, allowing the player to test their "killer" skills on one of several snow-based mountains. The game was released without much fanfare. Activision chose not to give the game a significant marketing push at launch. The game was reported to have sold a paltry 3,000 units in its first week on store shelves. Two versions of the game were sold at retail; a package including both the game as well as the skateboard peripheral, and a second package consisting solely of the game by itself. SoundtrackRanging from Pop-Punk to Rock to Hardcore to Metal, Tony Hawk: SHRED has a varied and interesting soundtrack consisting of 64 different tracks. These include:    A Day To Remember - "Have Faith In Me" Aceyalone featuring Bionik - "Workin' Man Blues" Alice Cooper - "Schools Out" Amazing Baby - "Smoke Bros" Anberlin - "We Owe This To Ourselves" The Appleseed Cast - "Fishing The Sky" At The Drive-In - "Cosmonaut" Bad City - "Wildlife" Bad Religion - "Only Rain" Baron  Black Mountain - "The End Of The Beginning" The Beach Boys - "I Get Around" Biffy Clyro - "Saturday Superhouse" Bill Haley  His Comets - "Rock Around The Clock" Braid - "The New Nathan Detroits" The Brian Setzer Orchestra - "Jump, Jive an' Wail" Brass Bed - "Pop Mission" Burning Brides - "If One Of Us Goes Further" Circa Survive - "Get Out" Coheed and Cambria - "World of Lines" The Comas - "Come My Sunshine" Cornelius - "Free Fall" Deftones - "Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)" Devo - "Uncontrollable Urge" Far - "Deafening" Foxy Shazam - "Unstoppable" Freeway  Jake One - "Throw Your Hands Up" G.B.H. - "Kids Get Down" Greek Fire - "Doesn't Matter Anyway" Guttermouth - "Summer's Over" The Happy Hollows - "High Wire" The Henry Clay People - "End Of An Empire" Hot Hot Heat - "Implosionatic" Iggy Pop  The Stooges - "Search And Destroy" Jimmy Eat World - "My Best Theory" The Law - "Don't Stop, Believe" Little Fish - "Whiplash" Living Things - "Mercedes Marxist" Me First and the Gimmes - "Over The Rainbow" Mike Posner - "Cooler Than Me" Moving Units - "Between Us  Them" Nena - "99 Red Balloons" Neon Trees - "Animal" Obits - "Widow Of My Dreams" OK Go - "This Too Shall Pass" Orion - "Electro Snake" Psychosis - "Building Empires" Psychosis - "Face of War" Rise Against - "The Good Left Undone" Rival Schools - "Travel By Telephone" Royal Republic - "The Royal" Sam  Dave - "Soul Man" Sleigh Bells - "Kids" Social Distortion - "Reach For The Sky" The Soft Pack - "Answer To Yourself" Sponge - "Plowed" Story Of The Year - "The Dream Is Over" Surfer Blood - "Swim" The Swellers - "Sleeper" Switchfoot - "The Sound (John M.
