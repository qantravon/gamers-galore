Getting hit by one of these objects sends Buford down to the bottom of the tower and he loses a life. Buford has to wait for an open window before he can climb to the next story. When he reaches Horrible Hank at the top of the screen, Hank takes off to the next level. Every few screens, the tower gets narrower. At the top of the tower, when Buford reaches Hank, Hank falls and Mabel is saved. At least until the next time Hank steals her away and Buford has to save her again.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="311">Donkey Kong</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/25854/845079-beauty_and_the_beast.png</image></root>
