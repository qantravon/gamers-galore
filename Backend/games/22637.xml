Shortly after the duel an earthquake hit Tokyo, and a golden palace emerged mysteriously from the wreckage. Along with the palace a powerful sorcerer named Hiruko appeared summoning demons to ravage the city.GameplayShinobi is a stylish action game which focuses on chaining together enemy kills in order to keep the Akujiki sword from draining Hotsuma's health. If the player is able to chain together enough consecutive kills they can trigger a brief cutscene of the enemies violently falling to pieces, in what is called a tate (tah-tey).DifficultyThe game is most notable for being fairly difficult; keeping in the spirit with it's predecessors. The game offers an unlockable hard mode, and also an inferno mode these are not for the casual gamer.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20553">Ninja Gaiden II</game><game id="21178">Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</game><game id="6602">Ninja Gaiden Black</game><game id="2838">Bujingai: The Forsaken City</game><game id="20710">Bayonetta</game><game id="4493">Castlevania: Curse of Darkness</game><game id="20131">Otogi: Myth of Demons</game><game id="5511">Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1852741-box_shinobips2.png</image></root>
