These actions are also represented with symbolic icons, rather than typed out as words.</description><genres><genre id="4">Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="28520">Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</game><game id="28876">Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!!</game><game id="37128">Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2372271-yamamura_misa_hana_fc.jpg</image></root>
