<root><id>5173</id><name>Bebe's Kids</name><description>Based on the animated film of the same name, Bebe's Kids is a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up in the style of The Simpsons Arcade Game. You can choose to play as Lashawn, the girl, or Kahill, the boy, although each character plays identically. You have a basic punch, kick, and jump button, along with a modifier button that allows, when held in correspondence to an attack, allows for you to use an uppercut move which defeats basic enemies in a few attacks. Most of the game is a simple side-scroller with a few basic environments, such as the food court and the haunted house. There are some light puzzle elements, along with a maze level, but for the most part, this is a linear, derivative game.It's the first and only game in Nintendo Power history to receive the score of Zero, and The Nostalgia Critic reviewed it in a response to the Angry Video Game Nerd, and labeled it the 'Worst Game Ever".Most of the problems stem from the unforgiving time limit for each level, the awkward control, the bad collision detection, the looping and somewhat grating sound effects and music, and the fact that it takes tens if not dozens of hits of your basic attack to take down one enemy.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9801">Beethoven's 2nd</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/13/137417/2364189-bebeskidsboxshotsnes.jpg</image></root>
