The player can also create three additional characters to follow the protagonist and modify them to their liking rather than relying on pre-generated characters found later in the game, though the latter option still exists if the player wishes to exchange them with the ones they generated.It is the first Deep Dungeon game to be released on NES cartridge, and was not available for the MSX or Famicom Disk System. It, like the rest of the Deep Dungeon series, was never released outside of Japan.</description><genres><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9180">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</game><game id="1216">Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Youjutsushi</game><game id="39306">Deep Dungeon II: Yuushi no Monshou</game><game id="40032">Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi he no Tabi</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/2/23093/2342961-deepdungeon3yuushihenotabi.jpg</image></root>
