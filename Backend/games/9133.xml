<root><id>9133</id><name>Firebugs</name><description>Firebugs is a futuristic racing game from the developers ATD. The game features five characters (Gismo, Carrie, B.O.W, Zero and Kami), each with their own vehicles. Two of these characters (Gismo and B.O.W) are named after  members of the Finnish dance/hip-hop/electro music act, Bomfunk MC's,  who also provide most of the music for the game. The main object of Firebugs is to win the Grand Prix mode, racing in each of the five fictional venues. The racing itself is almost identical to that of  Rollcage, a previous Attention to Detail game for   PS1, in that the wheels of vehicles are larger than the body allowing them to flip over can carry on driving and the loose physics permits driving along the walls or ceilings of tunnels.  Another touchstone is the Mario Kart series.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="6">Driving/Racing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="20610">WipEout HD</game><game id="19071">Super Mario Kart</game><game id="9060">Rollcage</game><game id="21285">Rollcage Stage II</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16793/803213-firebugs.jpg</image></root>
