<root><id>11226</id><name>Asterix and the Magic Cauldron</name><description>To those who are not familiar with the French          comic book series, which is incredibly popular in         Europe, here is the gist. The Roman Empire is at full flow, crushing and conquering everything in its way. Yet, one little Gaul village upholds a resitance which cannot be broken by the largest Roman army. It all comes down to the village        druid and his       magic potion which blesses the drinker with inhuman powers to knock those Romans off their      sandals.  In The Magic Cauldron, the very     cauldron has been smashed and the heroes,    Asterix    Obelix embark on a journey to replace it, which leads them from the deepest forest to the remotest Roman town, fighting off  wild boars and even wilder Roman warriors on their way.   The gameplay is simple, screen for screen, the player beats up whichever or whoever stands in his way. The game switches to a "fight-window" mode whenever an encounter takes place (see the screenshots). </description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="1866">Ardok the Barbarian</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58746/1120461-asterix_and_the_magic_cauldron_coverart.png</image></root>
