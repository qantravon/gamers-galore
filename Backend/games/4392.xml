As a result of using such a small dictionary, if a word is entered by the user that is not in the dictionary the computer will ask the user to confirm - if they confirm that it is a word then the computer will trust them: since the game simulated a board game and was single-player, cheating was a complete waste of time.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1270/815847-computer_scrabble_3.jpg</image></root>
