The game is set up as an open world in which you can drive around and perform objectives as well as earn cash by crashing into other cars. In order to pimp out their rides you must complete events such as "Ghost Riding Your Whip" until you have enough money to make the car of their dreams. Once you have enough money you are given a short amount of time to race around the city to suppliers where you purchase new and crazy upgrades to the junkers the customers once had. Ultimately, it is your job to pimp out Xzibit's ride.
