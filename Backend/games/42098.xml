Go on an epic adventure and explore a huge world with the nameless blonde chick GunGirl or her best friend GunDude (aka Marvin). On your quest you have to find more and more weapons, power-ups and special items that will give you access to new areas of the game.

But when you thought nothing could get worse anymore, you find that glowing red door at the end of that dark pit and find yourself lost in the very depths of hell…</description><genres><genre>Action</genre><genre>Horror</genre><genre>Platform</genre><genre>Role-Playing</genre><genre>Shooter</genre></genres><image>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/9951-1.jpg</image></root>
