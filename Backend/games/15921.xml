It plays very much like the previous two Hydlide games.When the game was released on the NES two years later, it underwent some major changes to become more like the RPGs of that period. The game had NPCs in towns to talk to, equipment and items to buy from shops and more story presentation, including an animated opening cutscene. This version would eventually be graphically remastered even further and be released on the Genesis as Super Hydlide.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="4">Adventure</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14318">Ys: The Vanished Omens</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1500208-hyd3_front.jpg</image></root>
