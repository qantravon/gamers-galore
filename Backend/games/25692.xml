Instead Frontline Studios is still developing the game and it will be released under the name Extraction Point: Alien Shootout. However as of March 23, 2011 Apogee software announced that they never actually lost the license to the duke nukem name and that they would release "Duke Nukem: Critical Mass" for the Nintendo DS in mid April of 2011, but only in the European markets. It is still unknownÂ whether it will keep its original title or if it will ever even see the light of day in the American market.</description><genres /><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2285643-box_dncm.png</image></root>
