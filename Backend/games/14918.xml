Of course, this applies to whichever game they debuted as for example Cammy is only allowed to use Super or Super Turbo, while Sagat cannot use Street Fighter 2 : World Warrior because he wasn't playable in that game. There are certain advantages towards using a certain style like Super Turbo allowing super moves while using pre-Super styles allows more damage and more chances to get an opponent dizzy.An arcade version was also developed but was not released outside of Asia.Special FeaturesAs the game is a special, 15th anniversary edition it also included the original 1994 full length anime movie of Street Fighter II.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="9">Fighting</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="18288">Last Bronx</game><game id="20616">Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</game><game id="243">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</game><game id="16842">Street Fighter: Anniversary Collection</game><game id="32744">Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/797004-918998_27035_front.jpg</image></root>
