<root><id>4569</id><name>Ganbare Goemon 2</name><description>OverviewGanbare Goemon 2 is the sequel to the first Ganbare Goemon and retains many of its core elements, such as its Double Dragon-style field depth, the three "pass" system that requires careful exploration of each stage before the player can proceed to next and Goemon's propensity for daring heists, the proceeds of which are then donated to the poor townspeople. Further emphasized in this game is the series' trademark odd sense of humor, which would continue to be exaggerated even further with future sequels.The biggest change is the addition of effete overweight ninja Ebisumaru, Goemon's best friend and partner in crime and, crucially to the game, the second player character. He would continue to be a major presence in every subsequent Ganbare Goemon game.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="9763">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</game><game id="42175">Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijou Yuukai Jiken</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5822/554823-ganbare_goemon_2_nes_box_front.jpg</image></root>
