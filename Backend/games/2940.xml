<root><id>2940</id><name>Shipwreckers!</name><description>Overview Shipwreckers is a      third-person arcade-style shooter where you sail around in a     pirate ship  battling other    pirate vessels and destroying the   gun turrets and   flamethrowers that are defending ports in an attempt to  spread your swashbuckling reign of terror. What this actually entails is bringing down their two-colored flags and  replace them with a Jolly Roger.   Weapons and PowerupsAt your disposal is a an arsenal that ranges from simple cannonballs to           mines,          oil slicks,  and oddly, the occasional         antiaircraft rocket. In addition to weapons, there are weird temporary         power-ups like the "instant blimp" that pulls in your  sails and "grows"       a blimp from atop the mainmast allowing you to float over obstacles, and enemies while remaining out of harm's way.     Graphics and ToneThe game never takes itself too seriously, featuring exploding fish, and cute Raggedy Anne  pirates morbidly afloat in the water after jumping ship. For the time, the water effects were very impressive, from  the glint of light off the waves, to the shadows of airborne predators,  to the uncommon transparency effects. When enemy ships are sunk they  remain visible below the waves, a few feet beneath the surface.   Multiplayer The game features multiplayer games that supported up to 5 players (with the use of a              Multi-Tap) and contained several game types, including            deathmatch, and a             capture the flag variant.   All players played on the same screen, with the camera angle zooming out when players moved away from each other.</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="2">Strategy</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="30990">Aqua</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/776341-shipwreckers.png</image></root>
