The game bore some visual resemblance to Lucas' SCUMM-based adventure games, but operated on a much larger scale, allowing players to roam around an entire island, collecting tokens and directly interacting with other players.Â The Lucas technology was later licensed by Fujitsu for release on the FM Towns as Fujitsu Habitat. The whole thing was later picked up by a company that operates a somewhat-modernized version of the same concept under the name VZones.</description><genres><genre id="16">MMORPG</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="17569">Habitat</game><game id="22991">There</game><game id="20237">Second Life</game><game id="22581">PlayStation Home</game><game id="26451">Labyrinth: The Computer Game</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/1715533-clubcarfront.gif</image></root>
