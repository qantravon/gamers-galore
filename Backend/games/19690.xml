The player must recover the 25 pieces of a map locating the position of the Scepter of Order, the only known artifact capable of defeating Arech.GameplayKing's Bounty is a turn based strategy game much in the same vein as Heroes of Might and Magic. The player must explore the game in order to find non-playable characters (NPCs) that they can recruit and then prepare these NPCs for battle. Also when the player is in combat they have to deal with a game clock which decreases on varying rates depending on the character's level. There are several ways the player can meet Arech Dragonbreath, some of which don't require finding map pieces.RemakeA remake with updated graphics was released in 2001 for the Playstation 2, redubbed "Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragonbone Staff"The game remained basically intact, with only a couple of the units replaced. The map designs remained the same.</description><genres><genre id="2">Strategy</genre><genre id="5">Role-Playing</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="14391">Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest</game><game id="17108">Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff</game><game id="30935">Kaiser</game><game id="345">Hammer of the Gods</game><game id="5679">Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Grey Wolf</game><game id="38081">Legends of Eisenwald</game><game id="40758">Conquest of Elysium 3</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2370693-genesis_kingsbountytheconquerorsquest.jpg</image></root>
