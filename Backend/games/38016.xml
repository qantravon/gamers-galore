That said, Really Shooter also accepts commando jobs on the side. When a swarm of animal robot aliens invade, the tag-team duo jump to action to save their business--and the planet. However, since Really Shooter is also a cleaner, he'll have to sweep empty shells into recycling stations to make more ammo, as well as clean up goo-splattered walls to earn points and credit from Poor Mama.Alien Chaos 3D is slated for a Summer 2012 release window for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Europe. No information is available yet about a U.S. release.</description><genres><genre id="41">Platformer</genre></genres><similar_games /><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2331079-box_ac3d.png</image></root>
