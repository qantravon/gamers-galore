While being an expansion pack the game can also be played standalone without the need for the original title. Perseus mandate was developed by TimeGate Studios, the same developers responsible for the first expansion pack, Extraction Point. While the original title and the first expansion focused on one main character, Perseus Mandate sees the introduction of a new protagonist which allows the events in the game to run concurrently with the events in both F.E.A.R. and Extraction Point. However, it should be noted that the sequel to F.E.A.R, F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin, ignores the events of this expansion pack as well as Extraction Point.LevelsInterval 01 - InvestigationArrivalUnderneathFirefightInterval 02 - RevelationRescue and ReconDisturbanceInterval 03 - ApprehensionPacificationBio-ResearchThe Plaza ChaseInterval 04 - DevastationBuriedThe DeepInterval 05 - InfiltrationRelicBasecampInterval 06 - ExplorationLabyrinthInterval 07 - ExterminationClone FacilityClone ProductionShowdown</description><genres><genre id="1">Action</genre><genre id="32">First-Person Shooter</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="8804">Condemned: Criminal Origins</game><game id="20465">Condemned 2: Bloodshot</game><game id="36028">Black Death</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/787678-fear_perseus_mandate_cover.png</image></root>
