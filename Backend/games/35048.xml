The game has you playing as an Aperture Science test subject and you must guide him to the exit by using portals. You manually aim your portals on surfaces (brown surfaces mean you can't stick a portal on them) and must use clever thinking and momentum to succeed.Due to the flash version's immense popularity, the levels were released for the original Portal as a custom map pack.</description><genres><genre id="18">Puzzle</genre><genre id="43">Action-Adventure</genre></genres><similar_games><game id="21170">Portal</game><game id="12720">Narbacular Drop</game><game id="38873">Gateways</game></similar_games><image>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/126726/1774253-giant_bomb_sub_3.jpg</image></root>
